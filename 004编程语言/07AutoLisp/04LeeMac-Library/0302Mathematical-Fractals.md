For me, this is a truly fascinating area of Mathematics since it is astounding that an object of such overwhelmingly infinite complexity may be generated from iterations of such simple equations.

## Julia Fractal

I look at the behaviour of the polynomial:

Julia Fractal Equation

In which z is a complex number (taking the form: z = u+iv where i is the square root of -1); and c is a complex constant, commonly known as the Julia constant.

To generate the fractal image, I plot complex values on the XY Plane. The Real part of z spans the X-axis, and similarly the Imaginary part spans the Y-axis. In this way the Real XY plane can be visualised as the Argand (or Complex) plane.

To plot the fractal, I take a portion of the Complex plane (the image size) and divide it up into a few hundred thousand discrete points (the image resolution); I then proceed to process each point to determine the colour it should display. The algorithm to determine such colour is as follows

Take a point z in the complex plane, calculate f (z) for a predetermined value of the Julia Constant.
Take the result of the above calculation and recursively apply the above function to obtain f ( f (z)).
Count the number of iterations taken for either the norm (magnitude) of the resultant complex number to exceed a certain value (in this case: 2), or for the number of iterations to exceed an iteration limit (in this case: 255).
The recorded number of iterations is then the colour of the point z.

Repeat the above procedure for every point in the plane (in this case, every point in the image of the specified size & resolution).

## Mandelbrot Fractal

The Mandelbrot Fractal is generated using the same function and algorithm as the Julia Fractal, however, the value of the previous Julia Constant in the above calculations becomes the point being processed, and the value of z is initially zero for every calculation

In this way we are effectively calculating the set of points c for which the sequence obtained after applying the function f recursively, does not diverge.

It is interesting to note that there exists only one Mandelbrot Fractal, but infinitely many Julia Fractals; furthermore, there exists a Julia Fractal at every point in the Mandelbrot set.
