[Multi-Polyline | Lee Mac Programming](http://www.lee-mac.com/mpline.html)

## Program Description

This simple program enables the user to create objects with the appearance of multilines, however, which are composed of standard polylines.

Upon issuing the command syntax MPL at the AutoCAD command-line, the program will invoke the standard AutoCAD MLINE command, allowing the user to construct the object with the real-time dynamic preview afforded by the MLINE command, however with the resulting multiline automatically exploded & joined to form standard 2D polylines.

Such a command could be useful for quickly drafting of the cross-section of a pipeline, duct or wall.
