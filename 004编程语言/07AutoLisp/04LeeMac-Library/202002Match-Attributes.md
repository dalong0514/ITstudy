# Match Attributes

## 01. Program Description

This program allows a user to quickly match attribute properties for a selected source attribute and multiple destination attributes.

Upon calling the program with MatchAttribs at the command line, the user is prompted to select a 'source' attribute to be used as a template for other selected attributes. The user is subsequently prompted to select multiple 'destination' attributes - these attributes will consequently inherit the same properties as the selected 'source' attribute.

The properties to be matched are listed at the top of the source code, and may be edited to suit. These properties correspond to the ActiveX properties of the Attribute VLA-Object.
