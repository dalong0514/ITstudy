;	UPDATE BLOCK COLOR (updblkcl.lsp)
;	PRE-INSERTED BLOCK DEFINITION CLEAN-UP UTILITY
;
;	This routine is especially usefull to redefine pre-inserted blocks whose
;	entity colors need to be changed to BYLAYER.
;
;       This routine allows the user to update the color of
;	all entities within a block to a single color (exam: color=BYLAYER)
;	without the user having to explode the symbol.  By default the layer name of
;	all entities are NOT changed. The routine changes the original
;	definition of the block within the current drawing.
;	
;	To use this routine the user is asked to specify a single
;	color to place all entities of a selected block(s).
;
;	The user is next prompted to select one or more blocks to update. The routine
;	then redefines all entities of the block to the color specified.
;
;	When the user regenerates the drawing she/he will find that all
;	occurances of the block have been redefined.  This is because the
;	original definition of the block is changed!!!
