[Unique & Duplicate List Functions | Lee Mac Programming](http://lee-mac.com/uniqueduplicate.html)

Here are various subfunctions for manipulating lists in which items appear more than once. The list may be tested for or irradicated of all duplicate items, with a set of functions offering optional tolerances below which items are considered duplicate; or such duplicate items may instead be returned by the function. Alternatively, the number of occurrences of each item in a list may be displayed. Information about the purpose of each function is detailed in the comments above each function, and the required arguments and returns are demonstrated in the examples.
