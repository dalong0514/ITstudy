As AI turns labor into software, the opportunity to productize external professional services (e.g., in legal or accounting) has become a hot topic. However, we believe there is also substantial opportunity in productizing internal work within organizations. These responsibilities often fall under the umbrella term of "operations" and can range from full-time data entry and front desk roles, to routine operational tasks embedded in every other role. This work generates fewer media headlines, but it is the internal stitching that holds companies together.

These ops roles involve critical, but often repetitive and mundane tasks. Companies have historically attempted to automate these tasks by using Robotic Process Automation (RPA), but with generative AI, we believe true automation through agents is now possible. We've already seen early examples of agents working in production, such as Decagon's automated customer support. And with companies like Anthropic launching capabilities like computer use to enable models to meaningfully interact with existing software, there is a clear emerging infrastructure stack for founders to build verticalized intelligent automation applications.

These examples preview a world in which AI agents are able to fulfill the original promise of RPA, turning what used to be operations headcount into intelligent automation and freeing workers to focus on more strategic work.

随着人工智能（AI）将人力劳动转化为软件，如何将外部专业服务（例如法律或会计）产品化已成为热门话题。然而，我们认为组织内部工作的产品化也蕴含着巨大机会。这些工作通常被统称为「日常运营」，范围涵盖从全职数据录入和前台接待，到嵌入各个岗位的常规运营任务。虽然这些工作较少出现在媒体头条中，但它们是维系企业运转的重要纽带。

这些运营岗位虽然至关重要，但往往充斥着重复性和日常性的任务。企业一直在尝试通过机器人流程自动化（Robotic Process Automation，RPA）来实现这些任务的自动化。但随着生成式 AI（Generative AI）的发展，我们相信通过 AI 智能体（AI Agent，即能够自主执行任务的 AI 程序）实现真正的自动化已经成为可能。我们已经看到了一些早期成功案例，比如 Decagon 的自动化客户支持系统。随着 Anthropic 等公司推出让模型能够与现有软件进行有效交互的计算机操作功能，创业者们已经有了一个清晰的新兴基础设施体系来构建垂直领域的智能自动化应用。

这些案例预示着未来：AI 智能体将实现 RPA 的最初愿景，把原本需要运营人员处理的工作转变为智能自动化流程，让员工得以专注于更具战略性的工作。

### The Original Promise of RPA and the Impact of AI

Operations work is sprawling and diverse, including tasks like data entry, document extraction, information transfer, system migrations, and web scraping. These tasks are essential, but they often lack the APIs or direct integrations required for traditional software to manage them efficiently. Despite the shift toward software eating the world, tons of work is still done over phone calls, spreadsheets, fax lines, and paper forms.

Over the last decade, RPA became a buzzword for automating this type of work. Companies like UiPath, which was founded in 2005, promised to enable the "fully automated enterprise" and empower "workers through automation." But despite its IPO in 2021 and its current valuation, these last-generation RPA companies couldn't fulfill the promise of true automation. The technology at the time just wasn't advanced enough.

As a result, instead of true automation, these companies observed how their customers navigated a process, then built "bots" that mimicked the exact keystrokes and clicks that a human would make. While these bots often provided meaningful business value when they functioned correctly, they stumbled if the process was not rigid and clearly defined, or when it underwent changes. In addition, implementing these bots required expensive consultants, which meant RPA was only available to companies large enough to afford this heavy-handed approach.

With LLMs, however, we believe the original vision of RPA is now possible. Instead of hard-coding each deterministic step in a process, AI agents will instead be prompted with an end goal (e.g., book an appointment for the customer, transfer data from this document into this database), and then be empowered with the right tooling and context to take those actions on behalf of the company. They'll be adaptable to various data inputs and capable of handling changes in business processes. And because of this flexibility, they will be far easier to implement and maintain than traditional RPA systems.

RPA 的原始愿景与 AI 的影响

运营工作范围广泛且形式多样，包括数据录入、文档信息提取、信息传输、系统迁移和网页数据采集等任务。这些工作虽然必不可少，但往往缺乏传统软件高效管理所需的 API 或直接集成接口。尽管我们正在经历软件化浪潮，大量工作仍然依赖电话、电子表格、传真和纸质表格来完成。

在过去十年中，RPA 成为自动化此类工作的代名词。以 2005 年成立的 UiPath 为例，它承诺要实现「企业全面自动化」并「通过自动化赋能员工」。但尽管该公司在 2021 年成功上市并获得可观估值，这些上一代 RPA 公司始终未能实现真正自动化的承诺，主要是因为当时的技术还不够成熟。

结果是，这些公司并未实现真正的自动化，而是通过观察客户的操作流程，然后开发「机器人」来模仿人类的具体按键和点击操作。虽然这些机器人在正常运行时确实能创造业务价值，但一旦流程不够标准化或发生变化，它们就会遇到问题。另外，部署这些机器人需要昂贵的咨询服务，这意味着只有有实力支付高额费用的大型企业才能采用这种重型解决方案。

然而，随着大语言模型（Large Language Model，LLM）的出现，我们相信 RPA 的最初愿景现在终于可以实现了。AI 智能体不再需要对流程中的每个具体步骤进行硬编码，而是可以根据最终目标（比如为客户预约、将文档数据导入数据库等）来行动，并在正确的工具和场景支持下代表公司执行这些操作。它们能够适应各种数据输入形式，并能应对业务流程的变化。正是由于这种灵活性，它们比传统的 RPA 系统更容易部署和维护。

### The Future of AI Ops and Where the Opportunity Lies

We're excited about this opportunity in intelligent automation for two main reasons:

The potential market is enormous. For all the work that current software can handle, there are orders of magnitude more work that it cannot: work that is being done via pen and paper, spreadsheets, phone calls and fax. Intelligent automation can address the current labor costs associated with this work – comprising over 8 million operations / information clerk roles according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics – as well as the spend associated with outsourcing this work, representing a meaningful portion of the $250 billion business process outsourcing (BPO) market.

Startups largely have a greenfield opportunity in this space. There is often no existing software product for these workflows given their bespoke nature: the people were the product. As a result, these roles never developed "systems of record" in the way other roles did (e.g., Salesforce for sales, Workday for HR), meaning there is no software incumbent to "add AI" into their existing product suite. This market is wide open for startups.

Specifically, we view the market opportunity as focused on two main areas: horizontal AI enablers that execute a specific function for a broad range of industries, and vertical automation solutions that build end-to-end workflows tailored to specific industries.

AI 运营的未来与机遇

我们对智能自动化领域的机遇感到兴奋，主要基于两个原因：

首先，市场潜力巨大。当前软件能够处理的工作量与无法处理的工作量相比，后者要大出几个数量级：大量工作仍然通过纸笔记录、电子表格、电话和传真来完成。智能自动化不仅可以降低这些工作的人力成本（根据劳工统计局的数据，仅运营和信息文员就有超过 800 万个岗位），还可以减少外包支出，这在 2500 亿美元的业务流程外包（Business Process Outsourcing，BPO）市场中占据相当大的比重。

其次，创业公司在这个领域基本上是一片蓝海。由于这些工作流程往往具有很强的定制性，通常并不存在现成的软件产品：人就是产品本身。因此，这些岗位并未像其他职能那样发展出专业的管理系统（例如销售团队使用的 Salesforce，人力资源部门使用的 Workday），这意味着没有现有的软件供应商可以简单地在其产品中「添加 AI 功能」。对创业公司来说，这个市场充满机遇。

具体而言，我们认为市场机会主要集中在两个领域：一是为各行各业提供特定功能的横向 AI 赋能工具，二是为特定行业打造端到端工作流程的垂直自动化解决方案。

### Horizontal AI enablers

Today, every intelligent automation company is building a similar set of capabilities and internal tooling. This creates a perfect opportunity for startups to simplify the process by focusing on one, specific foundational component..

For example: almost every intelligent automation company has to parse unstructured data and output contextualized, structured data. Many companies have built this out internally, and companies like Reducto and Extend are working to be the horizontal enabler to solve this specific need.

We think there are many other core building blocks needed for complex intelligent automation — including but not limited to building web data crawlers, structuring data from unstructured sources, or writing data back to legacy systems.

横向 AI 赋能工具

目前，每家智能自动化公司都在构建相似的功能和内部工具。这为创业公司提供了绝佳机会，它们可以专注于开发某一个基础性组件，从而简化整个过程。

举例来说：几乎每家智能自动化公司都需要处理非结构化数据并输出带有上下文的结构化数据。许多公司都在内部开发这项能力，而像 Reducto 和 Extend 这样的公司则致力于成为解决这一特定需求的通用工具提供商。

我们认为，复杂的智能自动化还需要许多其他核心组件，包括但不限于：网络数据爬虫、非结构化数据处理工具、遗留系统数据回写工具等。

### End-to-end vertical automation

We've previously written about our excitement for investing in vertical software (software that sells to one particular industry). We think this is a particularly good fit for intelligent automation, since operational agents will need to have the narrower context and deep integrations to achieve the accuracy and consistency customers expect.

Every industry has back office operations that could be automated, and we've already seen startups use LLMs to automate one flow as a strategic wedge to build deeper for specific industry needs.

In healthcare, for example, Tennr has automated the referral management flow. Referrals are the lifeblood of any growing healthcare practice, but accepting a referral used to require a lot of manual labor (e.g., receiving a fax, having the front desk pull the information from the fax, and manually inputting that patient information into their system). Tennr has built intelligent automation to solve this information transfer problem – using LLMs to extract unstructured data from PDFs and faxes, run validations on the information, and then write that information back into the system of record (EHR) automatically. This dramatically reduces the time it takes to accept a referral, which allows customers to secure new business more quickly.

In logistics, trucking brokers spend an enormous amount of time processing inbound orders and tracking loads. Now, using intelligent automation, companies like Happyrobot can automatically check on load status and updates via AI-powered voice assistants, and companies like Vooma are able to ingest unstructured email data to automate price quoting and order entry into the trucking management system (TMS).

These companies often focus on automating a very narrow, but very common and important workflow in their respective industries, often involving data and information transfer. They do not seek to be the "system of record" — at least initially — and can thus bypass the difficult rip-and-replace problems of going after legacy systems. They also start by automating revenue-generating workflows making themselves top priorities for their customers. And because these automations start at the beginning of a workflow, these startups earn the right to the upfront data and downstream workflows.

We believe this approach is a winning formula for intelligent automation startups, and we're eager to partner with those going after this opportunity across different industries.

端到端垂直自动化

我们此前曾分享过我们对垂直领域软件（面向特定行业的软件）投资的热情。我们认为这种方式特别适合智能自动化，因为运营智能体需要在较窄的场景下进行深度集成，才能达到客户期望的准确性和一致性。

每个行业都有可以自动化的后台运营工作。我们已经看到一些创业公司使用大语言模型来自动化某个具体流程，将其作为深入开发特定行业解决方案的切入点。

1、在医疗保健领域，Tennr 就是一个很好的例子。他们实现了转诊管理流程的自动化。转诊对于任何正在发展的医疗机构来说都是重要的业务来源，但传统的转诊接收流程需要大量人工操作：接收传真、前台从传真中提取信息、手动将患者信息输入系统等。Tennr 开发的智能自动化解决方案很好地解决了这个信息传输问题 —— 使用大语言模型从 PDF 和传真中提取非结构化数据，验证信息的准确性，然后自动将信息写入电子健康记录系统（EHR）。这大大缩短了转诊处理时间，帮助客户更快地获取新业务。

2、在物流领域，货运经纪人往往要花费大量时间处理入站订单和跟踪货物。现在借助智能自动化，像 Happyrobot 这样的公司可以通过 AI 语音助手自动查询货物状态和更新信息，而像 Vooma 这样的公司则能够处理非结构化的邮件数据，实现报价自动化，并将订单自动录入运输管理系统（TMS）。

这些公司通常专注于自动化某个特定行业中一个看似很窄但却常见且重要的工作流程，通常涉及数据和信息的传输。它们最初并不追求成为「系统平台」，这使它们可以避开替换现有系统这个棘手的问题。它们选择从自动化创收工作流程开始，这让它们自然而然地成为客户的优先选择。而且因为这些自动化是从工作流程的源头开始的，这些创业公司也因此获得了前端数据和后续工作流程的机会。

我们相信这种方法是智能自动化创业公司的制胜法则，我们也期待与那些在不同行业探索这种机会的团队合作。

### Conclusion

We are incredibly excited by the future of intelligent automation. LLMs have given startups the opportunity to fulfill the initial promise of RPA. By automating tasks traditionally handled by labor, they can now tap into markets and opportunities that were previously too small or too difficult to pursue.

We believe a number of large companies will be built here – both in the horizontal enabling layer and in the verticalized end-to-end solution for customers in different industries.

If you're building an intelligent automation company, we'd love to chat.

结论

我们对智能自动化的未来充满热情。大语言模型为创业公司提供了实现 RPA 最初愿景的机会。通过将传统的人工任务自动化，他们现在可以开拓那些过去因规模太小或难度太大而无法触及的市场和机会。

我们相信这个领域将会诞生一批大型公司 —— 无论是在横向赋能层面，还是在为不同行业客户提供垂直化端到端解决方案方面。

如果你正在创建一家智能自动化公司，我们很期待与你交流。
