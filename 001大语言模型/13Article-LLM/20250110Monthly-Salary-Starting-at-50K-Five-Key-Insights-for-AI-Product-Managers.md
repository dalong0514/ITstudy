Recently, I’ve come across three or four excellent interview reports on AI product managers, packed with valuable insights. Combining the points discussed in these reports with the challenges I’ve faced in my current AI work, I’ve compiled this article.

最近，我阅读了三四篇关于 AI 产品经理的优秀访谈报告，这些报告中包含了许多宝贵的见解。结合这些报告中的要点以及我目前在 AI 工作中遇到的挑战，我撰写了本文。

Currently, I don’t post articles frequently and have hit a bottleneck in my knowledge in the AI field. I haven’t had much valuable input lately. Last month, I downloaded several relevant e-books from zlibrary but haven’t had the time to read them yet. I need to reflect on this.

目前，我更新文章的频率不高，而且在人工智能（AI）领域的知识上也遇到了瓶颈。最近，我在这方面没有什么有价值的新收获。上个月，我从 zlibrary 下载了一些相关的电子书，但还没来得及看。我需要好好反思一下这个问题。

### 01. Product, User, Technology

产品、用户、技术

The previous generation of product managers focused on solving PMF (Product-Market Fit), while the current generation of AI product managers also need to solve TPF (Technology-Product Fit).

以往的产品经理主要致力于解决产品与市场是否匹配（Product-Market Fit，PMF）的问题，而现在的人工智能（AI）产品经理还需要关注技术与产品是否匹配（Technology-Product Fit，TPF）的问题。

The first reason is that AI technology updates too quickly. Every month brings something new. Problems that couldn’t be solved a few months ago may now have corresponding open-source solutions. Difficult problems might now have ready-made technical solutions.

首先，人工智能（AI）技术的迭代速度实在太快了。几乎每个月都有新的进展涌现。几个月前还束手无策的问题，现在可能就有了相应的开源方案。曾经的难题，如今也可能已经有了现成的技术手段来解决。

Another reason is the probabilistic and uncertain nature of AI products. Whether it’s LLMs or image models like Stable Diffusion, you cannot precisely control what they generate. Many parameters need to be fine-tuned repeatedly. This ability to control the quality of model generation and understanding the boundaries of AI are challenging standards for measuring an AI product manager’s level.

另一个原因是人工智能产品本质上是概率性的和不确定的。无论是大语言模型（LLM），还是像 Stable Diffusion 这样的图像模型，用户都无法精确控制它们生成的内容。许多参数需要反复微调。控制模型生成质量的能力，以及理解人工智能边界的能力，是衡量人工智能产品经理水平的一个具有挑战性的标准。

From the user perspective, ordinary users who don’t understand AI think that AI capabilities are very strong, leading to very low tolerance for AI errors. If a drawing model doesn’t draw fingers well or a language model gives a random answer, they think the product is bad. Users don’t understand the probabilistic and uncertain nature of AI models.

对于用户而言，不了解 AI 的用户认为 AI 非常强大，因此对 AI 的错误非常不能容忍。如果绘图模型画不好手指，或者大语言模型给出随机的答案，他们就认为这个产品很差劲。用户并不理解 AI 模型具有概率性和不确定性。

Therefore, on one hand, we need to optimize the results delivered to users to increase the controllability of the models. On the other hand, we need to manage user expectations. For example, let users understand that this is not the final result but a draft that can be further edited. It should meet user expectations as much as possible, achieving 90% if not 100%. Otherwise, users won’t engage, and retention will be low.

因此，一方面，我们需要优化呈现给用户的结果，以增强模型输出结果的控制能力。另一方面，我们需要引导用户的预期。例如，应该让用户了解，这并非最终成品，而是一个可以进一步编辑的草稿。它应该尽可能满足用户的期望，即使不能达到 100%，也至少要达到 90%。否则，用户体验不佳，会导致用户流失，从而降低用户留存率。

If it’s an AI-native product, it might require creating instructional videos, user promotion, and education, or simplifying the user onboarding process as much as possible.

如果这是一个为 AI 而生的产品，它可能需要制作教学视频、进行用户教育和推广，或者尽可能简化用户上手流程。

Once, I worked with a business person using a complicated product that required downloading several plugins, each needing some configuration. While teaching them, they called a halt halfway, saying it was too complex.

有一次，我辅导一位商务人士使用一款复杂的产品，这款产品需要下载多个插件，而且每个插件都需要进行配置。在教学过程中，他们学到一半就停了下来，说这东西太难了。

In the past, product managers relied on engineers because many business logic had to be implemented through code.

过去，产品经理需要依赖工程师，因为许多业务逻辑都需要通过编写代码来实现。

Nowadays, with AI products, product managers can use prompts, temperature settings, and various AI workflow products (like Comfy UI for drawing AI) to try out without understanding algorithms and underlying code. They can modify configs, drag and drop to modify workflows, and deploy AI products themselves to understand specific situations.

如今，随着 AI 产品的发展，产品经理可以使用提示（prompts）、温度设置（temperature settings）以及各种 AI 工作流产品（例如 Comfy UI，用于图像生成），在不了解算法和底层代码的情况下进行尝试。他们可以通过修改配置（configs）、拖拽来调整工作流，并自行部署 AI 产品，从而更好地理解实际应用场景。

For many non-AI-native small and medium-sized companies, many engineers are new to AI and may not be more knowledgeable than you.

在许多并非以 AI 为主营业务的中小型公司中，许多工程师都是对 AI 不熟悉的，他们可能并不比读者更了解 AI。

AI product managers need to immerse themselves in the AI field, keeping up with monthly AI developments, reading AI papers, understanding underlying principles and the latest AI concepts, and personally deploying and experiencing AI’s pros and cons.

AI 产品经理需要深入 AI 领域，密切关注每月 AI 领域的发展动态，阅读 AI 论文，深入理解其背后的原理和最新的 AI 概念，并亲身体验 AI 技术的优势与不足。

Previously, product managers would outline business processes and expected results before communicating with engineers responsible for models and algorithms. However, in the AI era, this is unrealistic due to the rapid pace of AI technology changes.

过去，产品经理会在与负责模型和算法的工程师们沟通之前，概述业务流程和预期结果。然而，在 AI 时代，由于 AI 技术快速发展，这变得不切实际。

I have felt this directly. Initially, my boss wanted me to outline business processes, technical architecture, and AI product documentation for each module. Last year, I did write such documents, but they felt vague and impractical. Detailing one or two layers deeper became challenging, often referencing existing open-source or closed-source products and technologies, making the whole process feel awkward and rigid.

我对此深有体会。起初，我的老板希望我为每个模块撰写业务流程、技术架构以及 AI 产品文档的概要。去年，我确实编写过这类文档，但感觉内容空泛，缺乏实际指导意义。当尝试深入一到两层进行详细描述时，我发现这变得很有挑战性，因为常常需要引用现有的开源或闭源产品及技术，这让整个过程显得生硬且难以推进。

Not every module has ready-made open-source technologies, and products and technologies under each module are constantly evolving. Most importantly, no one tests these in practice; it was all on me. Writing such documents was more about pitching for funding rather than solving real problems. This highlights the issue with AI investments.

并非每个模块都有现成的开源技术，而且每个模块下的产品和技术都在不断演进。更重要的是，这些技术都没有经过实践检验，所有测试工作都由我承担。撰写这类文档更多是为了获取资金，而非解决实际问题。这凸显了当前 AI 投资中存在的问题。

The product sorting process, relying on algorithms to solve issues, is a problem in many large companies. Different departments handle models, products, and technology separately, which is why many AI innovations come from small teams of 10–20 people. For example, the recent French Kyutai’s Moshi, developed by 8 AI scientists.

在许多大型公司中，产品排序流程依赖于算法来解决问题，这本身就是一个难题。由于不同部门各自独立地处理模型、产品和技术，导致许多 AI 创新都来自 10-20 人组成的小团队。例如，最近法国 Kyutai 由 8 位 AI 科学家开发的 Moshi 就是一个例子。

Understanding the entire operation process helps identify parts that can be separated and areas where new technologies can enhance.

理解整个运作流程，有助于我们找出哪些环节可以独立出来，以及哪些地方能用新技术来改进。

In such small teams, everyone has their area of expertise while understanding each other’s domains and the overall AI product operation process.

在这样的小团队里，每个人都有自己的专长，同时也了解其他成员的专业领域以及整个 AI 产品的运作流程。

Personally, I prefer working under a sufficiently large framework to practically implement, test, and explore.

我个人更倾向于在足够大的框架下工作，以便进行实际实施、测试和探索。

Currently, I plan to focus on three areas:

目前，我计划专注于三个领域：

1 Understanding the latest product technologies, AI news, and potential user pain points and needs.

了解最新的产品技术、人工智能（AI）新闻，以及用户可能遇到的痛点和需求。

2 Consistently reading papers to understand technical principles.

坚持阅读学术论文，深入理解技术背后的原理。

3 Actively deploying and testing open-source projects, using user pain points to guide models in specific scenarios, whether through fine-tuning, LoRA, model pruning, or distillation, or even some agents.

积极地部署和测试开源项目，并以用户痛点为导向，指导模型在特定场景中的应用，例如通过微调（fine-tuning)、LoRA、模型剪枝（model pruning）或蒸馏（distillation）等方法，甚至可以借助一些 AI 智能体（AI Agent）。

Top product managers: Can foresee the future development and changes of the technology.

优秀的产品经理：能够预见技术的未来发展趋势和变革。

Generally, people’s understanding of AI is shallow, driven more by emotional excitement. Few take the time to research AI developments in academia and industry closely.

总的来说，人们对人工智能的了解还比较表面，更多是被情绪上的激动所影响。很少有人会花时间去深入研究学术界和产业界在人工智能领域的发展。

AI product capabilities are still basic, with initial technical development. Effective solutions for complex user scenarios require continuous iteration of both technology and products. User needs are also deepening; previously, AI only needed to respond to prompts, now it needs to engage in real-time conversations and generate dynamic images.

人工智能（AI）产品的功能目前还处于基础阶段，技术发展也刚起步。要有效解决复杂的用户场景问题，需要技术和产品不断迭代。同时，用户需求也在不断提高，从最初的只需响应提示，到现在需要进行实时对话和生成动态图像。

### 02. Recruitment

招聘

Let’s discuss recruitment, covering four basic aspects of the current job market.

我们来探讨一下招聘问题，主要涉及当前就业市场的四个基本方面。

1 Companies’ job descriptions for AI product managers are vague, and candidates’ resumes lack clear positioning.

首先，公司发布的 AI 产品经理职位描述含糊不清，而求职者的简历也缺乏明确的定位。

2 Previously, courses were sold to teach people to transition from other roles to product managers. Now, they teach product managers to transition to AI product managers, focusing only on traffic and sales, briefly covering how to use chatGPT and some introductory projects.

其次，过去，市面上有一些课程教导人们从其他岗位转行成为产品经理。现在，这些课程则专注于教产品经理如何转型为 AI 产品经理，但内容往往只关注流量和销售，简单介绍一下如何使用 chatGPT 以及一些入门级别的项目。「他们」指代不明，可以改为「这些课程」。

3 AI product manager roles include AI data processing product managers, large model strategy product managers, AI-native product managers, traditional products adding AI features product managers, image domain product managers, etc.

AI 产品经理的岗位可以细分为多种，例如 AI 数据处理产品经理、大模型战略产品经理、AI 原生产品经理、负责为传统产品添加 AI 功能的产品经理、图像领域产品经理等等。

4 AI product manager positions have remained unfilled for months, combining unresolved issues into a single role.

AI 产品经理的职位空缺已经持续数月之久，很多公司将多种未解决的问题都堆积到这一个岗位上，希望由 AI 产品经理一并解决。

Expanding on the fourth point:

关于第四点，我们进一步说明：

They require someone who understands technical principles, knows products, understands user needs and pain points, can evaluate technical paths and implementation costs based on requirements. This is very challenging, as few individuals possess all these skills. Those who do can start their own ventures instead of working for others.

他们需要具备以下能力的人：理解技术原理，熟悉产品，了解用户需求和痛点，并能根据需求评估技术路线和实施成本。这极具挑战性，因为很少有人同时掌握所有这些技能。拥有这些综合能力的人，往往会选择自己创业，而不是为他人工作。

Specific Interview Requirements for AI Product Managers:

AI 产品经理的特别面试要求：

Resume: Basic product manager skills plus AI-related work, including experience with AI workflows and involvement in AI projects addressing user pain points.

简历：除了具备基本的产品经理技能外，还需要有 AI 领域的工作经验，包括熟悉 AI 工作流程，以及参与过解决用户痛点的 AI 项目。

Interview: Candidates should have their own understanding of AI and its application scenarios, be familiar with AI products they’ve tried, and articulate their views, especially regarding user scenarios and the current technical boundaries of AI. Previous relevant work experience is a plus for quick onboarding.

面试：应聘者应该对 AI（Artificial Intelligence）及其应用场景有自己的理解，熟悉自己使用过的 AI 产品，并表达自己的观点，特别是关于用户场景和 AI 当前的技术边界。拥有相关工作经验会是在快速入职方面的优势。

Monthly Salary Starting at 50K! Five Key Insights for AI Product Managers

Joyce Birkins

Recently, I’ve come across three or four excellent interview reports on AI product managers, packed with valuable insights. Combining the points discussed in these reports with the challenges I’ve faced in my current AI work, I’ve compiled this article.

Currently, I don’t post articles frequently and have hit a bottleneck in my knowledge in the AI field. I haven’t had much valuable input lately. Last month, I downloaded several relevant e-books from zlibrary but haven’t had the time to read them yet. I need to reflect on this.

01 Product, User, Technology
The previous generation of product managers focused on solving PMF (Product-Market Fit), while the current generation of AI product managers also need to solve TPF (Technology-Product Fit).

The first reason is that AI technology updates too quickly. Every month brings something new. Problems that couldn’t be solved a few months ago may now have corresponding open-source solutions. Difficult problems might now have ready-made technical solutions.

Another reason is the probabilistic and uncertain nature of AI products. Whether it’s LLMs or image models like Stable Diffusion, you cannot precisely control what they generate. Many parameters need to be fine-tuned repeatedly. This ability to control the quality of model generation and understanding the boundaries of AI are challenging standards for measuring an AI product manager’s level.

From the user perspective, ordinary users who don’t understand AI think that AI capabilities are very strong, leading to very low tolerance for AI errors. If a drawing model doesn’t draw fingers well or a language model gives a random answer, they think the product is bad. Users don’t understand the probabilistic and uncertain nature of AI models.

Once, I worked with a business person using a complicated product that required downloading several plugins, each needing some configuration. While teaching them, they called a halt halfway, saying it was too complex.

Reflecting on it, I realized that for users who haven’t had much exposure to AI, the entry barrier was too high. Most of them wouldn’t have the time and energy to learn proactively. Users are generally lazy and influenced by inertia.

In the past, product managers relied on engineers because many business logic had to be implemented through code.

Nowadays, with AI products, product managers can use prompts, temperature settings, and various AI workflow products (like Comfy UI for drawing AI) to try out without understanding algorithms and underlying code. They can modify configs, drag and drop to modify workflows, and deploy AI products themselves to understand specific situations.
