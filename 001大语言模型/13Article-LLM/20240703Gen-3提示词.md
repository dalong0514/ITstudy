### Prompt Structures

Base Prompt

Prompts are most effective when they follow a clear structure that divides details about the scene, subject and camera movement into separate sections.

Using the following structure should help provide consistent results while you're familiarizing yourself with Gen-3 Alpha:

[camera movement]: [establishing scene]. [additional details].

Using this structure, your prompt for a woman standing in a tropical rainforest might look like this:

Low angle static shot: The camera is angled up at a woman wearing all orange as she stands in a tropical rainforest with colorful flora. The dramatic sky is overcast and gray.

Repeating or reinforcing key ideas in different sections of your prompt can help increase adherence in the output. For example, you might note that the camera quickly flies through the scenes in a hyperspeed shot.

Try to keep your prompt focused on what should be in the scene. For example, you would prompt for a clear sky rather than a sky with no clouds.

提示词结构

基础提示词当提示词按照一个清晰的结构，将场景、主体和相机运动的细节分开时，效果最佳。

使用以下结构可以帮助您在熟悉 Gen-3 Alpha 时获得一致的结果：

[相机运动]：[场景描述]. [额外细节].

例如，您想描述一个站在热带雨林中的女人，可以这样写：

低角度静态镜头：相机向上拍摄一个穿着全橙色的女人，她站在一个有彩色植物的热带雨林中。天空阴沉而灰暗。

Low-angle static shot：The camera looks up at a woman dressed entirely in orange, standing in a tropical rainforest with colorful plants. The sky is overcast and gray.

在提示词的不同部分重复或强调关键点有助于提高生成结果的一致性。例如，您可以指出相机在超高速镜头中快速穿越场景。

尽量将提示词集中在场景中应有的内容上。例如，提示词应写「晴朗的天空」而不是「没有云的天空」。

Sample Prompts

Seamless Transitions

Continuous hyperspeed FPV footage: The camera seamlessly flies through a glacial canyon to a dreamy cloudscape.

Camera Movement

A glowing ocean at night time with bioluminescent creatures under water. The camera starts with a macro close-up of a glowing jellyfish and then expands to reveal the entire ocean lit up with various glowing colors under a starry sky. Camera Movement: Begin with a macro shot of the jellyfish, then gently pull back and up to showcase the glowing ocean.

Text Title Cards

A title screen with dynamic movement. The scene starts at a colorful paint-covered wall. Suddenly, black paint pours on the wall to form the word "Runway". The dripping paint is detailed and textured, centered, superb cinematic lighting.

示例提示词

无缝过渡

连续的超高速 FPV 画面：相机无缝飞过一个冰川峡谷，进入梦幻的云景。

相机运动

夜晚的发光海洋，水下有生物发光的生物。相机从发光水母的微距特写开始，然后扩展展示整个在星空下闪耀着各种发光颜色的海洋。相机运动：从水母的微距镜头开始，轻轻拉回并向上展示发光的海洋。

At night, a glowing ocean filled with bioluminescent creatures underwater. The camera starts with a close-up of a glowing jellyfish, then pulls back to reveal the entire ocean shimmering with various glowing colors under the starry sky. Camera movement：starting from the close-up of the jellyfish, gently pulling back and up to reveal the glowing ocean.

文字标题卡

带有动态效果的标题画面。场景开始于一面涂满色彩斑斓油漆的墙壁。突然，黑色油漆倾泻而下，形成「Runway」一词。滴落的油漆细腻且有质感，居中，灯光效果极佳，营造出电影般的氛围。

### Prompt Keywords

Keywords can be beneficial to achieve specific styles in your output. Ensuring that keywords are cohesive with your overall prompt will make them more apparent in your output.

In example, including keywords about skin texture wouldn't be beneficial to a wide angle shot where the camera is not closely focused on a face. A wide angle shot might instead benefit from additional details about the environment.

While keeping this cohesiveness in mind, below are different keywords you can experiment with while drafting your prompts.

关键词提示

关键词有助于实现特定的风格效果。确保关键词与整体提示一致，可以使它们在输出中更加突出。

例如，在广角镜头中，包含皮肤质感的关键词就不太适用，因为镜头并未紧密聚焦在脸上。广角镜头更适合增加环境细节的关键词。

以下是一些可以在起草提示时使用的不同关键词，供您参考。
