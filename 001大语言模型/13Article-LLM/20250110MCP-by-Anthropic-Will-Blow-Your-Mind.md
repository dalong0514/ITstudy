Trust me this is not a clickbait, MCP will revolutionize AI Interactions

请相信，这绝非标题党，MCP 将彻底革新 AI 交互方式。

AI technology is growing really fast.

人工智能（AI）技术正以惊人的速度发展。

You might be waiting for the latest models like GPT-5, Gemini 2 or Claude 4 but here’s something important to know — the real power of AI today isn’t just in having the newest models.

您或许正在期待 GPT-5、Gemini 2 或 Claude 4 等最新模型，但这里有一个重要的认知 —— 如今，AI 的真正力量不仅仅体现在拥有最先进的模型上。

It’s about how we connect these AI models to the world around them.

这关乎我们如何把这些 AI 模型与它们所处的世界连接起来。

It’s about giving them the right tools, data and context to help them understand better.

也关乎如何给予它们合适的工具、数据和背景信息，从而帮助它们更好地理解。

That’s where Anthropic’s Model Context Protocol (MCP) comes in.

这时，Anthropic 的模型上下文协议（Model Context Protocol，MCP）就显得至关重要了。

MCP isn’t just an upgrade it’s a game-changer that opens up a whole new way to use and create AI.

MCP 不仅仅是一次升级，更是一项颠覆性创新，它为人工智能的应用和创造开辟了全新的途径。

Let me explain why MCP is such a big deal and how it could be the key to the future of smart AI agents.

让我解释一下为什么 MCP 如此重要，以及它如何成为未来 AI 智能体的关键。

Before starting let me show you how MCP works in the simplest way possible.

在开始之前，让我用最简单的方式向你展示 MCP 的工作原理。

Think of it like a smart translator between you and your AI assistant:

不妨把它看作是你和你的 AI 助手之间的一个智能翻译：

Let’s break this down:

我们来仔细分析一下：

1 You ask a question through Claude Desktop (that’s our MCP Host)

你通过 Claude Desktop（我们的 MCP 主机）提出问题

2 The AI thinks about your request

AI 正在思考你的请求

3 If it needs more info it reaches out to special tools (MCP Servers)

如果需要更多信息，它会调用专门的工具（MCP 服务器）

4 These tools fetch what’s needed and send it back

这些工具会获取需要的信息并返回

5 Finally you get your answer!

最终，你会得到答案！

Nice right?

怎么样，是不是很棒？

Now let’s see why this is such a game-changer!

现在，让我们来揭秘这为何会带来颠覆性的改变！

### 01. Connecting AI to Live Data

将 AI 与实时数据连接

Here’s the problem: Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT, Claude and others are really smart but they have one big limitation — they stop learning after a certain point in time.

像 ChatGPT 和 Claude 这样的大语言模型（LLM）非常智能，但它们有一个主要的缺点，那就是在某个时间点之后，它们就停止了学习。

Imagine asking your AI assistant for updated information about your business or even just the latest weather and it can’t answer because it only learned information from a year ago.

试想一下，当你向你的 AI 助手询问关于你业务的最新动态，或是最近的天气情况时，它却无法给出答案，因为它所掌握的信息还停留在一年之前。

That’s pretty frustrating, right?

这的确相当令人沮丧，不是吗？

That’s where MCP helps.

而这正是 MCP 能够发挥作用之处。

MCP works like a universal connector by allowing LLMs to connect to live data sources.

MCP 的作用就像一个通用连接器，它让大语言模型能够连接到实时数据源。

Instead of working with old, outdated information, MCP gives AIs real-time, two-way communication with current systems.

与使用陈旧过时的信息不同，MCP 使 AI 能够与当前的系统进行实时的双向交流。

It’s kind of like the difference between reading an old encyclopedia and talking to someone who just read today’s news and browsed the latest updates.

这就像是阅读一本旧百科全书，和与一个刚刚读完今天新闻、并浏览过最新动态的人交谈之间的差别。

That’s how much more powerful MCP makes AI.

MCP 就是这样大幅提升了 AI 的能力。

### 02. From Many Different Tools to One Unified System

从多种工具到统一系统

Before MCP if you wanted an AI to connect to an external tool or system you had to build a special connector for each one.

在 MCP 出现之前，如果想让 AI（人工智能）连接到外部工具或系统，你必须为每个工具都构建一个特定的连接器。

This took a lot of time and effort and was hard to maintain.

这耗费了大量的时间和精力，而且维护起来非常困难。

The Model Context Protocol changes all that by giving everyone a universal, open standard for connecting AI assistants to any tool or data source.

模型上下文协议（Model Context Protocol）通过为所有人提供一个通用的、开放的标准，将 AI 助手（AI assistant）连接到任何工具或数据源，从而彻底改变了这种情况。

This makes things much simpler and easier to expand.

这让一切变得更加简单，也更容易扩展。

Whether it’s Slack, GitHub or web scraping tools like Puppeteer — all of these can now be connected in the same straightforward way.

无论是 Slack、GitHub 还是像 Puppeteer 这样的网页抓取工具 —— 所有这些现在都可以用同样简单的方式连接起来。

Imagine you have a Claude AI assistant. MCP lets this assistant connect to different servers (like data sources or tools) through what we call an MCP host.

假设你有一个 Claude AI 助手。MCP 允许这个助手通过一个叫做 MCP 主机的机制连接到各种服务器（例如数据源或工具）。

Right now, the Claude Desktop App acts as that host. But imagine if you could also connect it directly into a code editor like VS Code. Suddenly, the AI could help you like a real developer: creating files, running code, testing, and even managing projects.

目前，Claude 桌面应用充当着这个主机的角色。但试想一下，如果你能将它直接接入像 VS Code 这样的代码编辑器，会怎么样？ 这样一来，AI 就能像真正的开发者一样协助你：创建文件、运行代码、进行测试，甚至是管理整个项目。

You know what’s really amazing?

你知道吗，现在有一项技术非常令人惊叹？

All these different tools can now talk to each other through MCP!

各种不同的工具现在可以通过 MCP 相互连接并进行信息交换！

Let me show you what that looks like:

接下来，我将向您展示它的具体形态：

Look at how everything connects:

请观察各部分之间的连接方式：

1 Your development tools (like Git and code editors) work together

你的开发工具（例如 Git 和代码编辑器）可以协同工作，

2 Your data tools (databases and analytics) share information

你的数据工具（数据库和分析）可以共享信息，

3 Even your communication tools (Slack, email)

甚至你的通讯工具（Slack、电子邮件）也能协同工作。

It’s like having all your favorite apps finally becoming best friends! lol

这就像你所有最喜欢的应用软件终于成了好朋友一样！哈哈

### 03. Practical Use Cases (Making Everyday Tasks Easier)

实际应用（让日常任务更轻松）

Question is so how does this help in real life?

那么，这在现实生活中究竟有什么用处呢？

Let me give you a few examples:

AI-Powered Coding Tools:

AI 驱动的编码工具：

Imagine you’re a developer using VS Code. You want an AI that doesn’t just suggest code but also interacts directly with your environment — pulling code from GitHub by testing it on your computer and making changes after you approve them.

如果你是一位使用 VS Code 的开发者，你可能想要一个 AI，它不仅能提供代码建议，还能直接与你的开发环境互动。例如，它可以从 GitHub 获取代码，在你的电脑上进行测试，并在你确认后进行修改。

This is now possible. With MCP, the AI becomes a real part of your workflow. There are MCP servers for Git, GitHub and even your file system by making the AI feel like part of your development team.

现在，这一切都已成为现实。借助 MCP，AI 可以真正融入你的工作流程。通过让 AI 像你开发团队的一员那样工作，你可以在 Git、GitHub 甚至文件系统中使用 MCP 服务器。

To set up an MCP server for Git, it might look like this:
This setup allows your Claude assistant to interact with your Git repository — pulling changes, committing code and even running tests.

要为 Git 设置一个 MCP 服务器，配置方法可能如下所示：

{
  "mcpServers": {
    "git": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": ["mcp-server-git", "--repository", "path/to/git/repo"]
    }
  }
}

这样的配置可以让你的 AI 助手与 Git 代码仓库进行交互，例如拉取更改、提交代码，甚至运行测试。

Research and Data Analysis:

研究与数据分析：

Let’s say you’re doing research. With MCP and a search API like Brave Search and your AI assistant could search live for new articles and pick out the important parts, and summarize them — all without you having to type anything into a browser.

例如，假设你正在进行研究。有了 MCP 和类似 Brave Search 的搜索 API，你的 AI 助手就可以实时搜索最新的文章，提取关键信息并进行总结 —— 整个过程你无需在浏览器中输入任何内容。

You could also set up a memory server to store all your research notes, so your AI remembers what it found and builds on it each time.

你还可以搭建一个记忆服务器来存储所有的研究笔记，这样你的 AI 就能记住它所发现的信息，并在此基础上不断学习和进步。

Here’s how you could set up a Brave Search server:

以下是如何搭建一个 Brave 搜索服务器的步骤：

{
  "mcpServers": {
    "braveSearch": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-brave"]
    }
  }
}

This allows your assistant to perform web searches automatically and get the latest information whenever you need it.

这能让你的 AI 自动进行网络搜索，并在你需要的时候获取最新信息。

Business Automation:

业务自动化：

Imagine managing multiple projects across tools like Slack, Google Drive and custom databases.

试想一下，你需要同时在 Slack、Google Drive 和自定义数据库等多个工具中管理多个项目。

Normally, you would have to switch between all these tools and manually update everything. MCP creates a bridge that lets your AI assistant read messages from Slack, pull files from Google Drive and update your database and even give you a daily report.

通常，你需要频繁切换各种工具，并手动更新信息。而 MCP 则像一座桥梁，让你的 AI 智能体（AI Agent）可以读取 Slack 消息，从 Google Drive 获取文件，更新数据库，甚至为你生成每日报告。

It’s more than just an assistant — it’s like having a project manager working for you. Here’s how you can add a Google Drive server to Claude Desktop:

它不仅仅是个助手，更像是为你服务的项目经理。下面是如何将 Google Drive 服务器添加到 Claude Desktop 的步骤：

{
  "mcpServers": {
    "googleDrive": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-googledrive"]
    }
  }
}

This setup allows your assistant to connect to Google Drive, pull documents and even help organize your files.

通过这样的设置，你的助手就能连接到 Google Drive，获取文档，甚至帮你整理文件。

Personalized Workflows:

个性化工作流程：

MCP is like a do-it-yourself kit for making your AI assistant work exactly how you want.

MCP 就像一个 DIY 工具包，你可以用它来定制你的 AI 助手，让它完全按照你的意愿工作。

Want it to connect to your Trello boards, update your grocery list or control your smart home through Google Maps or Cloudflare?

想让它连接到你的 Trello 看板，更新你的购物清单，或者通过 Google 地图或 Cloudflare 控制你的智能家居吗？

MCP makes all of this possible without complicated coding.

MCP 让所有这些都成为可能，而且无需复杂的编程。

You can use some Python or TypeScript servers plug them into your Claude Desktop app and suddenly your AI can do anything from managing your groceries to your home security. For example, here’s how you could set up a file system server to let the assistant work with your local files:

你可以利用一些 Python 或 TypeScript 服务器，并将它们集成到你的 Claude 桌面应用中。这样，你的 AI 就能执行各种任务，例如管理你的日常购物清单，或是监控你的家庭安全系统。举例来说，以下展示了如何搭建一个文件系统服务器，使 AI 智能体能够访问并操作你的本地文件：

{
  "mcpServers": {
    "filesystem": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem", "/path/to/allowed/files"]
    }
  }
}

This means your assistant can read, write, or modify files directly on your computer but only in the folders you choose.

这意味着你的 AI 智能体可以直接读取、写入或修改你电脑上的文件，但仅限于你指定的文件夹内。

### 04. How to Get Started

如何开始

Ready to try this yourself?

你准备好亲自尝试一下了吗？

Don’t worry setting up MCP is easier than you might think!

Once you get the hang of it, the possibilities are endless.

一旦你掌握了其中的诀窍，各种可能性便会涌现。

Imagine creating a Python script that connects your custom database to your Claude assistant for real-time updates.

试想一下，你可以创建一个 Python 脚本，将你的自定义数据库连接到 Claude 助手，实现实时更新。

Here’s an easy example of setting up an MCP server in Python:

这是一个用 Python 设置 MCP 服务器（MCP Server）的简单示例：

```py
from mcp_server import MCPServer

class MyCustomServer(MCPServer):
    def handle_request(self, request):
        if request['type'] == 'get_data':
            return {'data': 'Here is your custom data!'}
if __name__ == "__main__":
    server = MyCustomServer()
    server.run()
```

This example shows how easy it is to set up a simple server that returns some custom data whenever your Claude assistant needs it.

这个例子展示了设置一个简单的服务器是多么容易，它可以随时在你的 Claude 助手需要时返回一些自定义数据。

### 05. Building Custom Tools and Agents

Maybe you want more than just the pre-built servers from Anthropic.

The MCP SDK lets you create a server that can pull your specific data and send it directly to your AI.

MCP SDK 允许你创建一个服务器，它可以提取你特定的数据，并直接将其发送到你的 AI 模型。

Want your AI to track company performance?

想让你的 AI 智能体（AI Agent）追踪公司业绩吗？

Use the Postgres MCP server or build your own that better suits your needs. You can even add multiple servers by creating an entire network of data sources that your assistant can use.

你可以使用 Postgres MCP 服务器，或者构建一个更符合你需求的服务器。你甚至可以通过创建 AI 智能体可以访问的完整数据源网络来添加多个服务器。

The coolest part? MCP isn’t just one-way.

最令人称奇的是，MCP 并非单向通信。

The AI can send data too — it can read from GitHub and also make changes.

AI 智能体（AI Agent）也可以发送数据，它不仅能从 GitHub 读取信息，还能进行修改。

It can check trends and then compile a report for you.

它可以分析趋势，然后为你生成报告。

And because MCP is open for everyone anyone can contribute to it and make it better. Imagine a future where everyone’s MCP servers work across all different AI models — OpenAI, Google, Anthropic — all working together.

并且，由于 MCP 是一个开放平台，任何人都可以参与贡献，使其变得更加完善。设想一下，未来的场景是，每个人的 MCP 服务器都能够兼容所有不同的人工智能模型，例如 OpenAI、Google 和 Anthropic，实现协同工作。

This could become the standard for making AI models more useful.

这有望成为提升 AI 模型实用性的标准。

### 06. The Future

展望未来

This isn’t just about what we can do now; it’s about where we’re heading.

这不仅仅关乎我们目前的能力，更关乎未来的发展方向。

Trust me this is not a clickbait, MCP will revolutionize AI Interactions

AI technology is growing really fast.

You might be waiting for the latest models like GPT-5, Gemini 2 or Claude 4 but here’s something important to know — the real power of AI today isn’t just in having the newest models.

It’s about how we connect these AI models to the world around them.

It’s about giving them the right tools, data and context to help them understand better.

That’s where Anthropic’s Model Context Protocol (MCP) comes in.

MCP isn’t just an upgrade it’s a game-changer that opens up a whole new way to use and create AI.

Let me explain why MCP is such a big deal and how it could be the key to the future of smart AI agents.

Before starting let me show you how MCP works in the simplest way possible.

Think of it like a smart translator between you and your AI assistant:

Created by author
Let’s break this down:

You ask a question through Claude Desktop (that’s our MCP Host)
The AI thinks about your request
If it needs more info it reaches out to special tools (MCP Servers)
These tools fetch what’s needed and send it back
Finally you get your answer!
Nice right?

Now let’s see why this is such a game-changer!

Connecting AI to Live Data

Here’s the problem:

Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT, Claude and others are really smart but they have one big limitation — they stop learning after a certain point in time.

Imagine asking your AI assistant for updated information about your business or even just the latest weather and it can’t answer because it only learned information from a year ago.

That’s pretty frustrating, right?

That’s where MCP helps.

MCP works like a universal connector by allowing LLMs to connect to live data sources.

Instead of working with old, outdated information, MCP gives AIs real-time, two-way communication with current systems.

It’s kind of like the difference between reading an old encyclopedia and talking to someone who just read today’s news and browsed the latest updates.

That’s how much more powerful MCP makes AI.

From Many Different Tools to One Unified System

Before MCP if you wanted an AI to connect to an external tool or system you had to build a special connector for each one.

This took a lot of time and effort and was hard to maintain.

The Model Context Protocol changes all that by giving everyone a universal, open standard for connecting AI assistants to any tool or data source.

This makes things much simpler and easier to expand.

Whether it’s Slack, GitHub or web scraping tools like Puppeteer — all of these can now be connected in the same straightforward way.

Imagine you have a Claude AI assistant. MCP lets this assistant connect to different servers (like data sources or tools) through what we call an MCP host.

Right now, the Claude Desktop App acts as that host. But imagine if you could also connect it directly into a code editor like VS Code. Suddenly, the AI could help you like a real developer: creating files, running code, testing, and even managing projects.

You know what’s really amazing?

All these different tools can now talk to each other through MCP!

Let me show you what that looks like:

Look at how everything connects:

Your development tools (like Git and code editors) work together
Your data tools (databases and analytics) share information
Even your communication tools (Slack, email)
It’s like having all your favorite apps finally becoming best friends! lol

Practical Use Cases (Making Everyday Tasks Easier)

Question is so how does this help in real life?

Let me give you a few examples:

AI-Powered Coding Tools:
