Unless you've been living under the world's biggest, soundproof rock for the last three years, you're undoubtedly aware that artificial intelligence is all but mandatory if you aspire to any degree of entrepreneurial success. To be clear, you don't have to build an AI-centered startup to be successful, but it does seem that failing to implement any of the rapidly-multiplying AI-enhanced tools out there will likely put you at a significant disadvantage.

除非你过去三年一直与世隔绝，否则你肯定已经意识到，如果你想在创业方面取得成功，人工智能几乎是不可或缺的。需要明确的是，你并不一定要建立一个以人工智能为核心的初创公司才能成功，但如果你不采用任何快速涌现的人工智能增强工具，你可能会处于明显的劣势。

If you read the title and have followed my lead here, you're probably thinking you know where I'm going with this: We'll all need to implement AI tools to stay competitive, which is going to gut our teams of all human roles, ruin the culture (and the economy, once 90% of people are unemployed), and bring us one step closer to the AI-pocalypse, right? I mean, if artificial intelligence can replace all our employees, can't it replace us entrepreneurs and do a better job outcompeting us with AI-founded startups? Then everyone who isn't an AI owner or programmer is broke and hopeless, right?

如果你读了标题，并且跟随我的思路，你可能已经猜到我要说什么了：我们都需要 AI 工具来保持竞争力，但这会导致我们团队中所有的人类岗位消失，破坏团队文化（以及经济，一旦 90% 的人失业），并让我们离 AI 末日更近一步，是这样吗？我的意思是，如果人工智能可以取代我们所有的员工，它难道不能取代我们这些创业者，并通过 AI 创立的初创公司在竞争中做得更好，从而超越我们吗？那么，是不是所有不是 AI 所有者或程序员的人都会破产和绝望呢？

That rapid spiral into the AI-pocalypse isn't necessarily incorrect, but it has little to do with the greatest looming problem that's gotten no airtime to date. The inevitable downside I'm referring to highlights the unfortunate reality of the unavoidable clash between humans and computers (or machines, robots, whatever you want to call them). AI may be accelerating our progress in many aspects of the world, but there's one thing this technology still can't (and may not ever fully) control…

那种迅速滑向人工智能末日（AI-pocalypse）的说法并非完全错误，但这与目前尚未被广泛讨论的最大隐患关系不大。我所说的必然存在的弊端，突显了一个令人遗憾的现实：人类与计算机（或机器、机器人，随便你怎么称呼它们）之间不可避免地会发生冲突。人工智能可能正在加速我们在世界许多领域的进步，但这项技术仍然有一件事无法（也许永远无法完全）掌控……

### If this…

如果是这样...

Before I delve into the consequence of the AI-ification of the startup world, let me first offer a brief deep dive into what AI is actually for (and what it isn't). If you had to guess, what would you say is the number one strength of artificial intelligence in one word?

在我深入探讨人工智能在初创企业领域普及的影响之前，请允许我先简单聊聊人工智能的真正作用（以及它不是什么）。如果要你猜，你会用一个词来形容人工智能最大的优点是什么？

If you said anything other than speed or volume, you're probably wrong in my book (though I'm open to debate on this, so feel free to challenge me in the comments). Simply put, though, the major benefit of employing artificial intelligence instead of human intelligence is the rate at which that intelligence can be used for productivity.

如果你的答案不是速度或数量，我可能不会认同（当然，我对此持开放态度，欢迎在评论区挑战我）。简单来说，使用人工智能而非人类智能的主要优势在于，它能以极快的速度投入生产。

For example, let's take marketing copy: With AI, you can write 100 or 1,000 (or more) email marketing funnels in the same time a human could manually write one, and the more powerful the AI, the more exponential that disparity of output. Okay, now that you've exponentially increased your productivity, what's the implied result or outcome? You can stew on that for a bit.

举个例子，看看营销文案：借助 AI，你可以在人类手动编写一个营销邮件流程的时间里，写出 100 个甚至 1000 个（或者更多）的营销邮件流程。而且，AI 越强大，这种产出效率的差距就越大，呈指数级增长。好，既然你的效率已经大幅提升了，那么随之而来的结果是什么呢？你可以好好琢磨一下。

Now that we've agreed AI is a productivity multiplier, is there anything else it exponentially improves? Perhaps quality or accuracy?

既然我们都认为 AI 可以倍增生产力，那么它还能以指数级提升其他方面吗？比如质量或准确性？

This is the first place humans employing AI go wrong. As a human who's been employing AI pretty heavily among an array of different projects, tasks, and use cases over the past two or so years, I can assure you that while it may outperform humans in speed, I wouldn't trust it to surpass them in quality or accuracy today. Why? Simple: AI is often being directed under the instruction of a human operator, and that person can in many ways cap the quality or accuracy of the AI-enhanced output.

这正是人类在使用 AI 时最容易犯的第一个错误。作为一名在过去两年左右的时间里，在各种项目、任务和应用场景中大量使用 AI 的人，我可以肯定地告诉你，虽然 AI 在速度上可能超越人类，但在质量或准确性方面，我并不认为它现在就能胜过人类。原因很简单：AI 的运行通常需要人类操作员的指导，而操作员的水平在很多时候会限制 AI 输出的质量或准确性。

This all goes back to the topic of prompt engineering: Garbage in, garbage out. Some AI can be very accurate and produce a higher quality output than its human guide could individually, but that human is still largely going to impact the quality and accuracy of that machine's output with their instruction.

这一切都回到了提示词工程（prompt engineering）的主题：输入低劣，产出也低劣。有些 AI 非常精确，能够生成比人类指导者单独完成时更高质量的输出，但人类的指令仍然会极大地影响机器输出的质量和准确性。

Why does all this matter? It all comes down to expectations versus reality, and it's crucial that humans relying upon AI have clear expectations grounded in reality, rather than in hope and blissful ignorance. There's one very common, very incorrect expectation poisoning the minds of countless entrepreneurs, and they're blind to their blatantly obvious mistake. The mistake is grounded in logic and correlations, but it omits one crucial factor…

为什么这一切至关重要？ 这都源于期望与现实的差距。对于依赖 AI 的人们来说，拥有基于现实的清晰预期至关重要，而不是抱持希望和盲目的乐观。然而，一个非常普遍且错误的期望正在影响着无数的企业家，他们对自身显而易见的错误却视而不见。这个错误虽然基于逻辑和关联，但却忽略了一个关键因素……

### Then this.

然后是这样。

Life (and business) is often a series of "if, then" statements, whereby the "if" is the thing we're contemplating doing, and the "then" is the logical result. One reason every entrepreneur seems to be hopping on the AI bandwagon as fast as possible is, as I mentioned earlier, to remain competitive. If the competitors are using artificial intelligence in their business, then I must use it in mine in order to produce at the same speed and volume and thus, prevent getting outshined or losing market share to their exponentially larger, faster AI-enhanced operation. That's a pretty normal, logical "if, then" conclusion, and I don't think it's wrong or rooted in baseless paranoia.

生活（和商业）常常是一连串的「如果，那么」的逻辑。这里的「如果」代表我们正在考虑做的事情，「那么」则代表由此产生的逻辑结果。正如我之前提到的，为什么每个企业家都争先恐后地拥抱 AI 浪潮，其中一个原因是为了保持竞争力。如果竞争对手在他们的业务中运用了人工智能，那么我也必须在我的业务中采用，这样才能以相同的速度和规模进行生产。这样做是为了避免被那些规模更大、速度更快、并借助 AI 增强的竞争对手超越，或者失去市场份额。这是一个很正常，符合逻辑的「如果，那么」的推论，我认为这并没有错，也不是毫无根据的杞人忧天。

However, that's not the "if, then" statement I'm worried about. Competitors are using AI; we know this. If we want to match or outpace their production, we likely need to use it, too. Fine.

然而，我所担心的并非简单的「如果，那么」的条件关系。竞争对手正在使用 AI（Artificial Intelligence)；我们很清楚这一点。如果我们想在生产上与他们匹敌甚至超越他们，我们可能也需要采用 AI 技术。这没问题。

The "if, then" statement I'm worried about has nothing to do with competitors, but everything to do with customers. Before dissecting the customer-AI clash, let's debunk the most common assumption entrepreneurs make when they start employing AI tools in their business: If I employ AI into my [sales, marketing, operations, etc.], then I should enjoy AI-induced results.

我所担心的「如果，那么」的说法，与竞争对手无关，而是完全取决于客户。在深入探讨客户与 AI 之间的矛盾之前，我们先来纠正创业者在业务中应用 AI 工具时最常见的误解：如果我把 AI 用在 [销售、营销、运营等] 方面，就理所当然地认为会获得 AI 带来的好处。

For example, if I 1000x our marketing content output or sales productivity (cold calls, emails, etc.), then I should expect to see 1000x conversions, right?

举例来说，如果我们将营销内容的产量或销售效率（例如陌生电话、电子邮件等）提升 1000 倍，那么理所当然地应该看到转化率也提升 1000 倍，对吗？

Do you see the problem? Hint: There isn't always a direct or linear correlation between effort (or productivity) and outcomes. In other words, just because you exponentially accelerate your productivity or efforts doesn't necessarily mean you'll enjoy exponentially accelerated results.

你发现问题所在了吗？提示：付出（或生产力）与最终结果之间并非总是存在直接或线性的关系。换句话说，仅仅因为你以指数级方式提高了生产力或投入，并不意味着你就能获得同样呈指数级增长的回报。

Why, though? This comes down to the one key caveat, also known as the human outlier, which AI enthusiasts seem to have forgotten still exists.

但，这是为什么呢？这可以归结为一个关键的限制因素，也就是人类的特殊性，而 AI 爱好者们似乎忽略了这一点。

### Speed was never the bottleneck.

速度从来不是瓶颈。

If the only bottleneck to success in business was speed, then AI would be the obvious silver bullet solution to exponentially accelerating and increasing sales and profit. There's a very simple, obvious, yet somehow overlooked reason why that just won't work: As much as you can increase the volume of sales, marketing, or operational activity you execute, you can't fully compensate for or take charge of the free will and unpredictable, uncontrollable nature of consumer behavior, also known as the human effect. This is where humans and machines clash, and there isn't necessarily a clear winner.

如果商业成功的唯一瓶颈是速度，那么人工智能将是加速和增加销售额与利润的理想解决方案。然而，有一个非常简单、明显但却被忽视的原因，说明这为什么行不通：无论你如何提高销售、营销或运营活动的执行量，你都无法完全弥补或掌控消费者行为中不可预测、不可控制的自由意志，也就是人类效应。这正是人类和机器产生冲突的地方，而且双方胜负难分。

Surprise: You can't exponentially speed up a prospect-to-customer's conversion timeline or emotional reaction by simply accelerating your rate or volume of marketing materials or product or service creation, launch, or operations! In other words, speed was never truly the bottleneck to startup growth or success! The AI-resistant wildcard of people (and human unpredictability) is still the bottleneck, but now we're only getting more frustrated with human results due to our AI-skewed expectations.

出乎意料的是：你无法通过简单地加速营销材料、产品或服务的创建、发布或运营的速度或数量，来指数级地缩短潜在客户的转化过程和情感反应！换句话说，速度从来不是初创公司增长或成功的真正瓶颈！人类（及其不可预测性）这种难以被 AI 替代的因素仍然是瓶颈，但由于我们被 AI 拔高的期望，我们对人类的表现只会越来越失望。

### Robot in, human out, operator confused

机器人输入，人工退出，操作者困惑

As entrepreneurs, we'd all love to run our businesses off a simple formula for growth and success, but most businesses aren't all that simple. If they were, every entrepreneur would simply reinvest profits or pour fundraising capital into more marketing efforts and applaud as their ventures bloomed from 6 to 7 to 8 to 9 figures and beyond. There's a reason that growth isn't so simple, seamless, linear, risk-free, or predictable across the board, and AI is only exacerbating this issue by making us believe robot-level input begets robot-level output without considering the true decision-makers hindering that growth.

作为企业家，我们都希望找到一个简单的公式来实现业务的增长和成功，但大多数业务的运作并非如此简单。如果真有如此简单的公式，那么每位企业家只需将利润再投资或将筹集的资金投入到更多的营销活动中，然后坐等企业从 6 位数增长到 7 位数、8 位数、9 位数甚至更高。增长之所以并非在所有情况下都如此简单、顺利、线性、无风险或可预测，是有其原因的。而人工智能（AI）的出现，反而加剧了这个问题，它使我们误以为只要有机器人级别的投入，就能获得机器人级别的产出，却忽略了真正阻碍增长的决策者是人。

TLDR: AI-infused action conditions us to expect AI-accelerated and amplified results, but we neglect the fact that human interference is the very thing that determines business success. Machines don't make most buying decisions, humans do, and those humans don't operate at superhuman AI speeds just because your startup's marketing activities or operations do.

TLDR：融入人工智能的行动使我们期望人工智能加速和增强的效果，但我们忽略了一个事实，即人为干预才是决定商业成功的关键。大多数购买决定是由人类而非机器做出的，而且这些人类不会因为你的创业公司的营销活动或运营而以超人的人工智能速度运作。

Thus, the increasing influence and implementation of AI into our startups only broadens the vast gap between a founder's expectations and the business results' reality to follow, aggravating our disappointment and confusing our entrepreneurial plight. This is just one poignant example of how AI may seem to be improving, enhancing, or accelerating the entrepreneurial journey, but in some ways, it's only increasing our unrealistic expectations and encouraging laziness, impatience, and founder frustration.

因此，人工智能在创业公司中日益增强的影响和应用，只会加剧创始人预期与实际业务结果之间的巨大落差，使我们更加失望，也让创业之路更加迷茫。这只是一个很明显的例子，说明人工智能看似在改善、增强或加速创业过程，但在某些方面，它只是提高了我们不切实际的期望，并助长了懒惰、急躁和创始人的挫败感。

Just because we have AI on our side doesn't mean we get to bypass the months or years of hustle, grind, tedium, nurturing prospects, and building our brand's reputation into something prospects recognize, respect, and even seek out. Until AI is controlling human behavior, we'll still need to accommodate the humans who currently make the world go round. So long as humans are paying our bills, they're the ones calling the shots, and AI will need to take a back seat to what the people really want (and when)…

仅仅因为我们有 AI 的支持，并不意味着我们可以跳过数月甚至数年的辛勤付出、艰苦奋斗、重复劳动、培养潜在客户，以及将品牌声誉打造成客户认可、尊重乃至主动寻求的程度。在 AI 控制人类行为之前，我们仍然需要适应这个由人类主导的世界。只要是人类在为我们买单，他们就拥有最终决定权，AI 需要让位于人们的真实需求（以及满足需求的时间）……
