Eight years I’ve been writing these annual reviews. Eight. I now regret starting the tradition of opening each with a pithy, allegedly humorous take on the year’s political news. When I started these in 2016 the idea was that, surely, things couldn’t get much worse — many people of the UK had voted to leave the EU, many people of the US had voted to take leave of their senses — and so future news round-ups would show the arc of history bending back in a better, happier direction, as we returned to meaningful international cooperation and tackled crises like climate change and mass migration together. Bloody hell was I wrong. The arc of history bends slowly.

我写年度回顾已经八年了。这八年里，我开始后悔在每篇开头用简短且自认为幽默的笔触来评论当年的政治新闻。2016 年我开始写这些回顾时，曾天真地认为情况不会更糟了 —— 英国脱欧，美国民众的投票也让人感觉「失去了理智」。我当时相信，未来的新闻总结会显示历史的车轮会朝着更好、更积极的方向前进，我们会重回国际合作的轨道，共同解决气候变化和大规模移民等危机。真是大错特错。历史的进程是如此缓慢。

So stuff the politics, let’s do some brains. The arc of science tends forward, progressing, improving. Science is always, in the round, a source of hope. As individuals we scientists may moan about our lot as researchers, or about crap studies, or terrible statistics, or how our institutions treat us. Yet our individual grumpiness adds up to constant, yearning improvement. Here are four small yet significant ways we improved our understanding of the brain this year. And odds are good something here will be true now and forever. Isn’t that cool?

所以，抛开政治，让我们来研究一下大脑。科学的进步是持续向前，不断改善的。总的来说，科学始终是希望的源泉。作为个体，我们科学家可能会抱怨自己作为研究人员的境遇，或者抱怨糟糕的研究、糟糕的统计数据，亦或是机构对我们的待遇。然而，我们个人的抱怨汇聚起来，却成了不断追求进步的动力。今年，我们在理解大脑方面取得了四个虽小但意义重大的进展。而且，很可能其中一些发现将是现在乃至未来都适用的真理。这难道不令人兴奋吗？

### 1. Vision quest

关于视觉的研究

Here’s a thought: Might we consider studying vision in an animal that uses it? Don’t get me wrong, we’ve learnt a lot from studying the visual system of rodents, from the details of how cortex is wired to the limits of sensory coding. And all of our most powerful tools, from imaging the neural activity of specific neurons to perturbing that activity with light, are most easily and powerfully used in mice, with the consequence that they are the animal of choice for large-scale work in visual neuroscience, notably by the Allen Brain Institute and the International Brain Laboratory.

这里有一个想法：我们是否可以考虑研究一种真正使用视觉的动物的视觉？请不要误解，我们从研究啮齿动物的视觉系统中学到了很多，从大脑皮层如何连接的细节到感觉编码的极限。我们所有最强大的工具，从对特定神经元的神经活动进行成像，到使用光来干扰神经活动，在小鼠身上都能够最方便和最有效地使用。因此，小鼠成为了视觉神经科学大规模研究的首选动物，特别是艾伦脑科学研究所（Allen Brain Institute）和国际脑实验室（International Brain Laboratory）。

But mice and rats are nocturnal. (I confidently state ‘nocturnal’, like all writers on this topic, yet my mind can’t help but turn to the large rat that has recently taken to visiting our lawn, joyfully bounding across it pretending to be a squirrel, occasionally pausing to take the air, in broad daylight, while our cat sits on the dining room table staring at it through the window with a demeanour of “it’s not my problem, mate” when it very much is.) Mice and rats can navigate the world just fine without light, or eyes, through a mixture of their sense of smell, their ability to keep track of their self-motion better than us (not hard) and, especially, their whiskers, which probe and prod the ground in front and objects around. Crudely put, their eyes are for detecting potential threats (things above them) and food (things below them). Not for watching Bridgerton or football or clips of pandas falling off logs. Rodents are a poor model for how humans use their eyes.

老鼠是夜行动物。(我像所有写这个话题的作者一样，自信地说出「夜行动物」这个词，但我的脑海里却不禁想起最近常来我们草坪的那只大老鼠，它欢快地在草地上蹦跳，像一只松鼠一样，偶尔还会停下来，在大白天里悠闲地呼吸空气。而我们的猫呢，正坐在餐桌上，隔着窗户盯着它，一副「这可不是我的问题」的样子，尽管这明明是它的职责。）老鼠在没有光线或眼睛的情况下也能在世界中自如地行动，它们依靠灵敏的嗅觉，以及比我们更强的自我运动感知能力（这并不难），特别是它们的胡须，用来探测前方的地面和周围的物体。简单来说，它们的眼睛主要用来发现潜在的威胁（上方的物体）和食物（下方的物体），而不是像人类一样用来看《布里奇顿》、足球赛或者熊猫摔下木头的视频。啮齿动物在视觉使用方面，与人类有很大差异，因此不能作为人类视觉研究的理想模型。

A lovely paper this year showed us something of what we might be missing. It simply asked, how does primate and rodent navigation differ? Our intrepid authors turned to the (common) marmoset, that like us is a primate, lives its waking life in daylight, and uses it front-facing big eyes to guide its behaviour. It’s also a cute, small 20-cm high monkey.

今年，一篇有趣的论文揭示了一些我们可能忽略的细节。它提出了一个简单的问题：灵长类动物和啮齿动物在导航方式上有何不同？为了找到答案，研究者们选择了常见的狨猴作为研究对象。狨猴和我们一样，都属于灵长类动物，它们白天活动，并依靠前视的双眼来引导行为。这是一种可爱的小型猴子，身高约 20 厘米。

By letting their marmosets forage freely in a 3D, split-level box rather like a massive hamster play arena (the arena is massive, not the hamsters), they found two basic differences from rodent vision. The first is that rats explore by moving, not looking; marmosets, by contrast, explore by looking, not moving. Not in itself a startling revelation, for that’s what we do: we scan our environments, noting salient features like the clock tower yonder or the small bronze statute of a urinating boy over there. But that’s the point. Rodents don’t do this.

研究人员让狨猴在一个 3D 分层结构的箱子中自由觅食，这个箱子很像一个巨大的仓鼠游乐场（是游乐场大，不是仓鼠大）。他们由此发现了狨猴视觉与啮齿动物视觉的两个主要区别。首先，老鼠主要通过移动来探索环境，而不是观察；而狨猴则相反，它们主要通过观察来探索，而不是移动。这本身并不令人惊讶，因为我们人类也是这样做的：我们会扫描周围的环境，留意重要的特征，比如远处的钟楼，或者那边的撒尿小男孩的青铜雕像。但这正是关键所在，啮齿动物并不会这样做。

The second difference is in the marmoset hippocampus. If you want to look at how animals are literally representing their place in the world, look there, for that is where are found the Nobel-prize winning place cells, the neurons that fire when a rodent is in a specific location of the world. So the team looked there in the marmosets. And found that no neuron was just a place cell. Sure, a majority of them had firing that related to where the marmoset was in the 3D, split-level box. But all of those neurons coded for something else too, and the majority of that was the view: what specific view the marmoset was looking at. And those place-related neurons did not cover much of the big box, whereas the view-related neurons did. Use an animal that has eyes to see and it turns out it uses different representations of the world than a rodent. What were the odds?

第二个不同之处在于狨猴的海马体。如果你想了解动物如何感知自己在世界中的位置，就应该关注这里，因为这里是发现诺贝尔奖得主所称的位置细胞的地方，这些神经元会在啮齿动物处于特定位置时激活。研究团队观察了狨猴的海马体，发现没有哪个神经元仅仅是位置细胞。虽然大多数神经元的活动都与狨猴在 3D 分层盒子中的位置有关，但它们也编码其他信息，其中最主要的是视野：狨猴正在看向的特定视角。而且，与位置相关的神经元覆盖范围远小于与视野相关的神经元。使用一种有视觉的动物，结果发现它对世界的表征方式与啮齿动物不同，这难道不令人惊讶吗？

### 2. Fly in the ointment

美中不足

As regular readers may recall, I’ve been sceptical about the worth of connectomes, of building the complete wiring diagram of the connections between each and every neuron in a brain. The source of the scepticism was simple: a wiring diagram is a terrific reference tool, just like the genome, making it easier to identify the parts of a brain and, when recording neurons, providing a way to better guess which neurons and what they connect to. But it is just a description, with little hypothesis-driven science possible without major further work. This scepticism has taken a beating recently. In 2021 Witvliet and co showed it was possible to derive scientific insight from the connectome alone — all you needed was more than one. They mapped the neural development of the tiny worm C Elegans by reconstructing connectomes at key stages of its life, providing, among other things, more strong evidence for the crucial role of randomness in the wiring of brains, even in a brain with just 302 neurons. And then, this year, FlyWire dropped.

正如读者可能记得的那样，我一直对神经连接图谱（connectome）的价值持怀疑态度，也就是构建大脑中每个神经元之间连接的完整布线图。这种怀疑的根源很简单：布线图是一个很好的参考工具，就像基因组一样，它可以更容易地识别大脑的各个部分，并且在记录神经元活动时，提供更好的方式来推测神经元的连接。但这仅仅是一种描述，若没有进一步深入的研究，很难开展假设驱动的科学研究。这个观点最近被挑战了。在 2021 年，Witvliet 等人表明，仅从神经连接图谱中获得科学见解是可能的 —— 只需要不止一个图谱。他们通过重建微小蠕虫秀丽隐杆线虫在生命关键阶段的神经连接图谱，绘制了其神经发育图，为大脑布线中随机性的关键作用提供了更有力的证据，即使是在一个仅有 302 个神经元的简单大脑中。然后，今年，FlyWire 项目发布了。

At its heart, FlyWire is the full connectome of the brain of the adult female fruit fly (or Drosophila melongaster if you insist). It’s a monster, in connectome terms: 140,000 neurons divided into a strangely-precise 8453 types of neuron and connected by about 50 million synapses, making up to 15 million connections between neurons (if we count every single synaptic connection). A lot of wire in a tiny brain of a tiny fly.

本质上，FlyWire 是成年雌性果蝇（学名黑腹果蝇）大脑的完整连接组。从连接组的角度来看，它堪称庞大：14 万个神经元被划分为 8453 种精细的神经元类型，并通过约 5000 万个突触相连，形成了神经元之间多达 1500 万个连接（如果我们计算每一个突触连接）。这只小小的果蝇的大脑里，布满了密密麻麻的「线路」。

But what made FlyWire special was the not the admittedly impressive technical feat of tracing all that wire but the effort put in to then doing science with it, to show how it could be used to drive knowledge forward. Officially, FlyWire dropped 11 papers as a collection across the Nature journals, ranging from a simulation that literally placed a model neuron everywhere there was an actual neuron, to a detailed probe of how the fly stops walking, using the connectome to show at least 3 separate neural pathways that call a halt, two seemingly specialised in stopping the fly to consume food rather than wandering past it looking mournfully at what it could have eaten, the third holding the fly still while grooming, so it doesn’t try to rub its face and walk at the same time, fall flat on its proboscis and look a bit of a prat to its mates.

但 FlyWire 的特别之处，并非仅仅在于其追踪所有神经连接的惊人技术成就，更在于其随后在科学研究中的应用，以展示它如何推动知识的进步。FlyWire 在《自然》杂志上共发表了 11 篇论文，内容涵盖广泛，从一个将模型神经元放置在与实际神经元相同位置的模拟，到对苍蝇如何停止行走的详细探索。通过连接组，研究人员揭示了至少 3 条独立的神经通路，它们负责发出停止行走的信号。其中两条通路似乎专门用于阻止苍蝇进食，避免它们徘徊在食物旁却无法进食；第三条通路则控制苍蝇在梳理毛发时的静止，防止它在揉搓脸部时行走而摔倒，显得笨拙。

Officially 11 papers; unofficially, I’d say at least 14. Pretty much every experimental, theory, and modelling paper relied on a crucial Cell paper from earlier this year that had inferred the sign of each connection already, whether it excited or inhibited it target — without that, much of the theory and modelling work would have been impossible. And two of the best papers appeared earlier this year, studying deep neural network models of the fly brain that were strongly constrained by the connectome: Lappalainen et al showed us that training wiring-constrained deep networks to track the visual flow of the world as the fly moves recovered many known types of neuron responses and predicted new ones; Cowley & co showed us a beautifully tight model-experiment interplay by training a deep network model to match the behavioural effects of knocking-out each of 23 types of early visual system neuron in the fly.

正式发表的论文有 11 篇，如果算上非正式的，我认为至少有 14 篇。几乎每一篇实验性、理论性和建模的论文都依赖于今年早些时候发表在《细胞》杂志上的一篇重要论文。这篇论文推断出了神经元之间每个连接的性质，即它是兴奋性的还是抑制性的。如果没有这项工作，许多理论和建模研究都无法进行。今年早些时候还出现了两篇非常优秀的论文，它们研究了果蝇大脑的深度神经网络模型，这些模型都强烈地受到了连接组的限制。Lappalainen 等人的研究表明，训练一个受神经元连接结构限制的深度网络来跟踪果蝇移动时的视觉信息流，可以重现许多已知的神经元反应类型，并预测新的反应类型。Cowley 及其合作者的研究则展示了一个精妙的模型与实验相互印证的例子：他们训练了一个深度网络模型，使其能够匹配敲除果蝇早期视觉系统中 23 种神经元后产生的行为变化。

We cannot of course abandon all scepticism, for science proceeds through reasonable doubt. Types of neurons remain a nebulous concept: it was telling that about a third of the neuron types found in the previously-published, partial half-brain connectome of the adult female fruit fly could not be found in the newly-constructed full brain. The favoured explanation is that the disagreement represents variation between individual flies. The figure of 8453 types was arrived at by taking a consensus across three half-brains: the previous half-brain one, and treating the new, complete one as two halves. But how can it be a neuron “type” if it is simply missing from a different individual of the same species (and one, I suspect, that is genetically-identical)?

当然，我们不能完全放弃怀疑，因为科学就是在合理的质疑中进步的。神经元的类型仍然是一个不太明确的概念：一个明显的例子是，在之前发表的成年雌性果蝇的部分半脑连接组中发现的约三分之一的神经元类型，在新构建的完整大脑中并没有找到。目前比较倾向的解释是，这种差异反映了个体果蝇之间的变异。8453 种类型的这个数字，是通过综合考虑三个半脑的数据得出的：一个是之前的半脑数据，另外是将新获得的完整大脑数据视为两个半脑的数据。但是，如果一个神经元「类型」仅仅因为在同一物种的不同个体（而且我怀疑是基因相同的个体）中缺失，那它还能被称为一个「类型」吗？

And deeply impressive as FlyWire is, the problem of scale remains: if we could scale the technology to the whole mouse brain, would such a synaptic-level connectome hold any value? After all, the constraints of genetically-specified connections between neurons must get weaker as the brains get bigger, so random chance plays more and more of a role in initial development, and life experience plays more and more of a role in sculpting connections from that baseline. What we want instead are the rules for wiring, but for that we need many, many connectomes, in order to infer the general principles they share. This creates a connectome paradox: as the brains get bigger so, conversely, the value of individual connectomes gets smaller. This suggests only making the leap to doing many brains at once is worth it, with little pay-off in the short-term. In the past I would have questioned whether it was worth it; FlyWire has given me pause for thought.

尽管 FlyWire 非常令人印象深刻，但规模问题依然存在： 如果我们能将这项技术扩展到整个小鼠大脑，这样一个突触层面的连接组是否还有价值？ 毕竟，随着大脑体积增大，神经元之间由基因决定的连接约束必然会减弱，随机性在早期发育中扮演的角色会越来越重要，而生活经验则在塑造基于初始状态的连接中发挥越来越大的作用。我们真正需要的是布线规则，而要获得这些规则，我们需要大量的连接组，以便从中推断出它们共同的普遍规律。这就产生了一个连接组悖论：随着大脑体积增大，单个连接组的价值反而会降低。这意味着只有立即着手研究多个大脑才是有意义的，短期内可能难以看到明显的回报。过去我可能会质疑这样做是否值得； FlyWire 的出现让我对此进行了重新思考。

### 3. Shining a light in the dark

拨开黑暗

Two papers especially piqued my interest this year as they were on topics close to my heart. The first paper gave a new take on dark neurons. I’ve written much about them before, including a dedicated chapter in my book The Spike. The short version is that cortical activity obeys a rough 80:20 rule — 80% of spikes come from just 20% of the neurons. That means the other 80% are mostly silent, firing much less than 1 spike every second. For any given moment in time, for any given behaviour, they are not active: they are dark. This raises the question of what they are for. Perhaps they are reserve neurons, awaiting recruitment to represent something new; perhaps they’re just very picky and we’ve just never shown them anything they’re interested in.

今年有两篇论文特别吸引我，因为它们的主题与我密切相关。第一篇论文对暗神经元有了新的解读。我之前写过很多关于暗神经元的文章，包括在我的书《The Spike》中的一个专门章节。简单来说，皮层活动大致遵循 80:20 规则 —— 80% 的神经元放电来自仅 20% 的神经元。这意味着剩下的 80% 的神经元大多处于静默状态，每秒放电次数远低于 1 次。在任何给定的时间，对于任何给定的行为，它们都不活跃：它们处于不活跃状态。这就引出了它们用途的问题。也许它们是储备神经元，等待被激活以代表新的信息；也许它们只是非常挑剔，我们从未向它们展示过任何它们感兴趣的内容。

Work from Oliver Gauld and colleagues in Michael Hausser’s lab this year offered a new view, that dark neurons are not reluctant to respond, they are actively suppressed. They looked at neurons in the barrel cortex, the neurons whose job is supposed to be responding to deflections of a single, unique whisker on a rodent’s face. They looked there because many of them don’t. It’s their only job, yet many neurons in a single “barrel”, representing a single whisker, don’t respond to deflections of that whisker. Indeed some of our best early evidence of dark neurons came from the total lack of response from neurons in barrel cortex.

今年，Michael Hausser 实验室的 Oliver Gauld 及其同事的研究提出了一种新观点：暗神经元并非不愿反应，而是受到主动抑制。他们研究了桶状皮层中的神经元，这些神经元本应负责对啮齿动物面部特定胡须的偏转做出反应。之所以选择这里进行研究，是因为许多神经元并没有反应。虽然这是它们唯一的工作，但在代表单根胡须的单个「桶」中，仍然有很多神经元对该胡须的偏转没有反应。事实上，我们早期发现的关于暗神经元的有力证据之一，就来自桶状皮层中神经元的这种完全无反应现象。

Gauld and co flicked a whisker on each side of a mouse’s face at the same time and simply asked it to report which side had moved the most. Many neurons in layers 2 and 3 of that whisker’s “barrel” were dark to the stimulus, not responding differently whether the left or right whisker had be stimulated. Yet activating enough neurons using light could bias the mouse’s choice to the other side, as though, when forced to be active, these dark neurons were perfectly capable of transmitting information about the whisker. So why didn’t they normally? Because they were locally and actively suppressed: the more some neurons were stimulated, the more the unstimulated neurons around them reduced their activity. This gives us a new “sparse coding” hypothesis for why neurons are dark: not because they are hardwired to respond to just a few, select features of the world, but because they are actively suppressed from responding. Some light in the darkness.

Gauld 和同事同时轻触小鼠脸部两侧的胡须，然后让小鼠报告哪一侧的胡须移动幅度更大。在负责处理胡须感觉的「桶状」感觉皮层区域的第 2 层和第 3 层中，许多神经元对这种刺激「不活跃」，也就是说，无论刺激的是左侧还是右侧的胡须，这些神经元的反应都无明显差异。然而，用光激活足够多的神经元后，可以引导小鼠选择另一侧，这似乎表明，当这些不活跃的神经元被迫激活时，它们完全有能力传递有关胡须的信息。那么，为什么它们通常不这样做呢？因为它们在局部受到了主动抑制：当一些神经元受到刺激时，它们周围未受刺激的神经元会减少活动。这为我们提供了一个新的关于神经元为何「不活跃」的「稀疏编码」（sparse coding）假说：不是因为它们被「固定」为只对世界上少数特定的特征做出反应，而是因为它们被主动抑制而无法做出反应。这就像黑暗中出现了一线曙光。

### 4. How low can you go?

维度能有多低？

The other paper that especially piqued my interest was a thought-provoking take on the dimensionality question: how many dimensions does neural activity have? It’s now routine to take a recording of hundreds or thousands of neurons and ask if the dynamics so captured have fewer dimensions than there are neurons. One reason to do this is that it makes understanding the brain easier: we don’t have to worry about coding in thousands of neurons, but just a comparative handful of dimensions of activity. Recently, I’d pointed out that as we increase the number of recorded neurons we hope the number of additional dimensions doesn’t scale with them; rather, we hope the number of dimensions of neural activity has a hard upper limit that is a tiny percentage of the number of neurons. Consider what happens if it doesn’t. There are about half a million neurons in the primary visual cortex of a mouse and about 50 million neurons in the primary motor cortex of a macaque monkey. Even if the number of dimensions of activity is just 1 percent of the number of neurons then if the dimensions of activity scales all the way to the full extent of the region’s neurons that’s still 5,000 dimensions in mouse visual cortex and 500,000 dimensions in the macaque’s motor cortex. That’s still high-dimensional in anyone’s book. This year, the 1-million-neuron paper appeared in Neuron, and had a first crack at answering to this question.

另一篇特别引起我兴趣的论文，以一种引人深思的角度探讨了维度问题：神经活动究竟有多少维度？现在，记录成百上千个神经元的活动，并探究这些活动所呈现的动态是否比神经元的数量维度更少，已经成为一种常规做法。这样做的一个原因是，它可以帮助我们更轻松地理解大脑：我们不必关注数千个神经元的编码方式，而只需关注少数几个活动维度。我最近指出，随着记录的神经元数量增加，我们希望新增的维度数量不会随之线性增长；相反，我们期望神经活动维度的数量存在一个上限，这个上限远小于神经元的总数。试想一下，如果情况并非如此会怎样？小鼠的初级视觉皮层大约有 50 万个神经元，而猕猴的初级运动皮层则大约有 5000 万个神经元。即使活动维度的数量仅为神经元数量的 1%，如果活动维度随着神经元数量同步增长，那么小鼠视觉皮层中仍然会有 5000 个维度，而猕猴的运动皮层则会有 50 万个维度。无论如何，这仍然是高维的。今年，一篇关于 100 万个神经元的论文发表在《Neuron》期刊上，首次尝试解答这个问题。

I’d previously covered this technical marvel when it was a pre-print: the scaling of calcium imaging to cover vast chunks of a mouse’s cortex, with typical recordings in the low hundreds of thousands, and one exemplar obtaining the activity of 1 million neurons at (roughly) the same time. So this team were the best-placed on the planet to ask how dimensions of activity scale with the number of neurons.

我之前在它还是预印本的时候就介绍过这项技术奇迹：钙成像技术扩展到覆盖小鼠皮质的大范围区域，典型的记录可以达到数十万级别，其中一个例子甚至同时记录了约 100 万个神经元的活动。因此，这个团队是世界上最适合研究神经元活动维度如何随神经元数量增加而变化的团队。

They estimated the number of “reliable” dimensions in the activity, essentially by finding how many dimensions were needed to capture the variation in activity of two sets of neurons at the same time — the idea being that these dimensions must be common to both sets, and thus not noise. And while 16 of these dimensions captured about half the variation in activity, the number of reliable dimensions grew unbounded with the number of neurons.

他们通过一种方法来估算神经元活动中「可靠」维度的数量： 找出需要多少个维度，才能同时捕捉到两组神经元活动的变化。这里的核心思想是，这些维度必须是两组神经元所共有的，因此不属于噪声。研究发现，虽然 16 个这样的维度能够捕捉到大约一半的活动变化，但随着神经元数量的增加，可靠维度的数量也随之不断增加。

On the one hand, this means that we can indeed describe a good chunk of activity with just a handful of dimensions. But on the other, it implies that recordings have to scale with the size of the targeted population in order to capture all that population’s shared dynamics. Which raises the obvious question: how do we know how big the targeted population is? But that’s a story for a different time.

一方面，这意味着我们确实可以用少数几个维度来描述相当一部分活动。但另一方面，它也意味着为了捕捉到这个人群共同的活动模式，录音的规模必须随着目标人群的扩大而增加。这就引出了一个显而易见的问题：我们如何知道目标人群有多大？这又是另一个话题了。

Is this thing on?
There was so much more of course. Rafal Bogacz and crew kicked the year off by taking a different slant on the problem of how the brain could approximate backprop and hence learn like an artificial neural network. Their slant being: it doesn’t, that would be silly. Instead, they proposed that a network of neurons predicts what the neural activity at the end of learning should look like, and then change synaptic weights according to whether that prediction looks correct or not. We also had much more on how psychedelics alter brain function, including suggestions they desynchronise activity in the human brain. And if you like science cartography, there’s now a map of the whole of PubMed.

这个东西开着吗？当然，还有更多精彩的内容。Rafal Bogacz 和他的团队在年初提出了一个关于大脑如何进行学习的新颖观点，他们没有像传统人工神经网络那样使用反向传播算法，而是认为大脑根本不这样做，因为那样做过于复杂。他们提出，神经元网络会预测学习结束后神经活动的状态，然后根据预测是否准确来调整神经元之间的连接强度（突触权重）。此外，我们还看到了更多关于迷幻药如何改变大脑功能的研究，包括它们可能导致人脑活动失去同步的观点。如果你对科学知识地图感兴趣，现在已经有了整个 PubMed 数据库的地图。

We also welcomed a new voice for neuroscience, The Transmitter, an ambitious online magazine offering us deep dives into neuroscience news and opinions, with that most unusual of things, a dedicated editorial team and a roster of journalists. Two examples of some great journalism this year: Shaena Montanari’s investigation into the whether simply flickering a light at 40Hz could clear Alzheimer’s brains of the amyloid plaques linked to the dementia, and Angie Voyles Askham’s deep dive into the controversy of whether its time to abandon one of the success stories of modern neuroscience, the reward prediction error theory of dopamine.

我们还迎来了一个神经科学领域的新声音 ——《The Transmitter》。这是一份雄心勃勃的在线杂志，它为我们提供深入的神经科学新闻和评论，更难能可贵的是，它拥有一支专业的编辑团队和一批新闻记者。今年，该杂志涌现了一些优秀的报道，这里列举两个例子：Shaena Montanari 调查了以 40Hz 频率闪烁的光线，是否能够清除阿尔茨海默症患者大脑中与痴呆相关的淀粉样斑块；Angie Voyles Askham 则深入探讨了关于是否应该放弃现代神经科学的成功理论之一 —— 多巴胺奖励预测误差理论的争议。

And, full disclosure, The Transmitter is also in my news this year: I’ve started a regular column there (apologies for the massive picture of my face that is at the end of the link — please scroll down quickly), kicking off with why averaging is holding back neuroscience and imagining the ultimate systems neuroscience paper.

另外，需要坦诚地说，今年 The Transmitter 也成为了我关注的新闻之一：我已经在那里开设了一个定期专栏（对于链接末尾出现我的大幅照片，我深感抱歉 —— 请快速向下滚动略过），首篇文章阐述了为什么「平均化」方法正在阻碍神经科学的发展，并设想了一篇完美的系统神经科学论文。

You could sign up to follow me there for more in 2025. You could continue to mournfully scroll through your social media feed. Either way, all I can suggest is that, if you’re after good news in 2025, it’s probably best to stick to science.

你可以注册在 2025 年关注我以获取更多资讯。你也可以继续刷着社交媒体，徒增伤感。无论如何，我只想说，如果你想在 2025 年看到好消息，或许关注科学才是更好的选择。

2024: A Review of the Year in Neuroscience

Dec 30, 2024

Eight years I’ve been writing these annual reviews. Eight. I now regret starting the tradition of opening each with a pithy, allegedly humorous take on the year’s political news. When I started these in 2016 the idea was that, surely, things couldn’t get much worse — many people of the UK had voted to leave the EU, many people of the US had voted to take leave of their senses — and so future news round-ups would show the arc of history bending back in a better, happier direction, as we returned to meaningful international cooperation and tackled crises like climate change and mass migration together. Bloody hell was I wrong. The arc of history bends slowly.

So stuff the politics, let’s do some brains. The arc of science tends forward, progressing, improving. Science is always, in the round, a source of hope. As individuals we scientists may moan about our lot as researchers, or about crap studies, or terrible statistics, or how our institutions treat us. Yet our individual grumpiness adds up to constant, yearning improvement. Here are four small yet significant ways we improved our understanding of the brain this year. And odds are good something here will be true now and forever. Isn’t that cool?

1. Vision quest
Here’s a thought: Might we consider studying vision in an animal that uses it? Don’t get me wrong, we’ve learnt a lot from studying the visual system of rodents, from the details of how cortex is wired to the limits of sensory coding. And all of our most powerful tools, from imaging the neural activity of specific neurons to perturbing that activity with light, are most easily and powerfully used in mice, with the consequence that they are the animal of choice for large-scale work in visual neuroscience, notably by the Allen Brain Institute and the International Brain Laboratory.

But mice and rats are nocturnal. (I confidently state ‘nocturnal’, like all writers on this topic, yet my mind can’t help but turn to the large rat that has recently taken to visiting our lawn, joyfully bounding across it pretending to be a squirrel, occasionally pausing to take the air, in broad daylight, while our cat sits on the dining room table staring at it through the window with a demeanour of “it’s not my problem, mate” when it very much is.) Mice and rats can navigate the world just fine without light, or eyes, through a mixture of their sense of smell, their ability to keep track of their self-motion better than us (not hard) and, especially, their whiskers, which probe and prod the ground in front and objects around. Crudely put, their eyes are for detecting potential threats (things above them) and food (things below them). Not for watching Bridgerton or football or clips of pandas falling off logs. Rodents are a poor model for how humans use their eyes.

A lovely paper this year showed us something of what we might be missing. It simply asked, how does primate and rodent navigation differ? Our intrepid authors turned to the (common) marmoset, that like us is a primate, lives its waking life in daylight, and uses it front-facing big eyes to guide its behaviour. It’s also a cute, small 20-cm high monkey.

By letting their marmosets forage freely in a 3D, split-level box rather like a massive hamster play arena (the arena is massive, not the hamsters), they found two basic differences from rodent vision. The first is that rats explore by moving, not looking; marmosets, by contrast, explore by looking, not moving. Not in itself a startling revelation, for that’s what we do: we scan our environments, noting salient features like the clock tower yonder or the small bronze statute of a urinating boy over there. But that’s the point. Rodents don’t do this.

The second difference is in the marmoset hippocampus. If you want to look at how animals are literally representing their place in the world, look there, for that is where are found the Nobel-prize winning place cells, the neurons that fire when a rodent is in a specific location of the world. So the team looked there in the marmosets. And found that no neuron was just a place cell. Sure, a majority of them had firing that related to where the marmoset was in the 3D, split-level box. But all of those neurons coded for something else too, and the majority of that was the view: what specific view the marmoset was looking at. And those place-related neurons did not cover much of the big box, whereas the view-related neurons did. Use an animal that has eyes to see and it turns out it uses different representations of the world than a rodent. What were the odds?

2. Fly in the ointment
As regular readers may recall, I’ve been sceptical about the worth of connectomes, of building the complete wiring diagram of the connections between each and every neuron in a brain. The source of the scepticism was simple: a wiring diagram is a terrific reference tool, just like the genome, making it easier to identify the parts of a brain and, when recording neurons, providing a way to better guess which neurons and what they connect to. But it is just a description, with little hypothesis-driven science possible without major further work. This scepticism has taken a beating recently. In 2021 Witvliet and co showed it was possible to derive scientific insight from the connectome alone — all you needed was more than one. They mapped the neural development of the tiny worm C Elegans by reconstructing connectomes at key stages of its life, providing, among other things, more strong evidence for the crucial role of randomness in the wiring of brains, even in a brain with just 302 neurons. And then, this year, FlyWire dropped.

At its heart, FlyWire is the full connectome of the brain of the adult female fruit fly (or Drosophila melongaster if you insist). It’s a monster, in connectome terms: 140,000 neurons divided into a strangely-precise 8453 types of neuron and connected by about 50 million synapses, making up to 15 million connections between neurons (if we count every single synaptic connection). A lot of wire in a tiny brain of a tiny fly.

But what made FlyWire special was the not the admittedly impressive technical feat of tracing all that wire but the effort put in to then doing science with it, to show how it could be used to drive knowledge forward. Officially, FlyWire dropped 11 papers as a collection across the Nature journals, ranging from a simulation that literally placed a model neuron everywhere there was an actual neuron, to a detailed probe of how the fly stops walking, using the connectome to show at least 3 separate neural pathways that call a halt, two seemingly specialised in stopping the fly to consume food rather than wandering past it looking mournfully at what it could have eaten, the third holding the fly still while grooming, so it doesn’t try to rub its face and walk at the same time, fall flat on its proboscis and look a bit of a prat to its mates.

Officially 11 papers; unofficially, I’d say at least 14. Pretty much every experimental, theory, and modelling paper relied on a crucial Cell paper from earlier this year that had inferred the sign of each connection already, whether it excited or inhibited it target — without that, much of the theory and modelling work would have been impossible. And two of the best papers appeared earlier this year, studying deep neural network models of the fly brain that were strongly constrained by the connectome: Lappalainen et al showed us that training wiring-constrained deep networks to track the visual flow of the world as the fly moves recovered many known types of neuron responses and predicted new ones; Cowley & co showed us a beautifully tight model-experiment interplay by training a deep network model to match the behavioural effects of knocking-out each of 23 types of early visual system neuron in the fly.

We cannot of course abandon all scepticism, for science proceeds through reasonable doubt. Types of neurons remain a nebulous concept: it was telling that about a third of the neuron types found in the previously-published, partial half-brain connectome of the adult female fruit fly could not be found in the newly-constructed full brain. The favoured explanation is that the disagreement represents variation between individual flies. The figure of 8453 types was arrived at by taking a consensus across three half-brains: the previous half-brain one, and treating the new, complete one as two halves. But how can it be a neuron “type” if it is simply missing from a different individual of the same species (and one, I suspect, that is genetically-identical)?

And deeply impressive as FlyWire is, the problem of scale remains: if we could scale the technology to the whole mouse brain, would such a synaptic-level connectome hold any value? After all, the constraints of genetically-specified connections between neurons must get weaker as the brains get bigger, so random chance plays more and more of a role in initial development, and life experience plays more and more of a role in sculpting connections from that baseline. What we want instead are the rules for wiring, but for that we need many, many connectomes, in order to infer the general principles they share. This creates a connectome paradox: as the brains get bigger so, conversely, the value of individual connectomes gets smaller. This suggests only making the leap to doing many brains at once is worth it, with little pay-off in the short-term. In the past I would have questioned whether it was worth it; FlyWire has given me pause for thought.

3. Shining a light in the dark
Two papers especially piqued my interest this year as they were on topics close to my heart. The first paper gave a new take on dark neurons. I’ve written much about them before, including a dedicated chapter in my book The Spike. The short version is that cortical activity obeys a rough 80:20 rule — 80% of spikes come from just 20% of the neurons. That means the other 80% are mostly silent, firing much less than 1 spike every second. For any given moment in time, for any given behaviour, they are not active: they are dark. This raises the question of what they are for. Perhaps they are reserve neurons, awaiting recruitment to represent something new; perhaps they’re just very picky and we’ve just never shown them anything they’re interested in.

Work from Oliver Gauld and colleagues in Michael Hausser’s lab this year offered a new view, that dark neurons are not reluctant to respond, they are actively suppressed. They looked at neurons in the barrel cortex, the neurons whose job is supposed to be responding to deflections of a single, unique whisker on a rodent’s face. They looked there because many of them don’t. It’s their only job, yet many neurons in a single “barrel”, representing a single whisker, don’t respond to deflections of that whisker. Indeed some of our best early evidence of dark neurons came from the total lack of response from neurons in barrel cortex.

Gauld and co flicked a whisker on each side of a mouse’s face at the same time and simply asked it to report which side had moved the most. Many neurons in layers 2 and 3 of that whisker’s “barrel” were dark to the stimulus, not responding differently whether the left or right whisker had be stimulated. Yet activating enough neurons using light could bias the mouse’s choice to the other side, as though, when forced to be active, these dark neurons were perfectly capable of transmitting information about the whisker. So why didn’t they normally? Because they were locally and actively suppressed: the more some neurons were stimulated, the more the unstimulated neurons around them reduced their activity. This gives us a new “sparse coding” hypothesis for why neurons are dark: not because they are hardwired to respond to just a few, select features of the world, but because they are actively suppressed from responding. Some light in the darkness.

4. How low can you go?
The other paper that especially piqued my interest was a thought-provoking take on the dimensionality question: how many dimensions does neural activity have? It’s now routine to take a recording of hundreds or thousands of neurons and ask if the dynamics so captured have fewer dimensions than there are neurons. One reason to do this is that it makes understanding the brain easier: we don’t have to worry about coding in thousands of neurons, but just a comparative handful of dimensions of activity. Recently, I’d pointed out that as we increase the number of recorded neurons we hope the number of additional dimensions doesn’t scale with them; rather, we hope the number of dimensions of neural activity has a hard upper limit that is a tiny percentage of the number of neurons. Consider what happens if it doesn’t. There are about half a million neurons in the primary visual cortex of a mouse and about 50 million neurons in the primary motor cortex of a macaque monkey. Even if the number of dimensions of activity is just 1 percent of the number of neurons then if the dimensions of activity scales all the way to the full extent of the region’s neurons that’s still 5,000 dimensions in mouse visual cortex and 500,000 dimensions in the macaque’s motor cortex. That’s still high-dimensional in anyone’s book. This year, the 1-million-neuron paper appeared in Neuron, and had a first crack at answering to this question.

I’d previously covered this technical marvel when it was a pre-print: the scaling of calcium imaging to cover vast chunks of a mouse’s cortex, with typical recordings in the low hundreds of thousands, and one exemplar obtaining the activity of 1 million neurons at (roughly) the same time. So this team were the best-placed on the planet to ask how dimensions of activity scale with the number of neurons.

They estimated the number of “reliable” dimensions in the activity, essentially by finding how many dimensions were needed to capture the variation in activity of two sets of neurons at the same time — the idea being that these dimensions must be common to both sets, and thus not noise. And while 16 of these dimensions captured about half the variation in activity, the number of reliable dimensions grew unbounded with the number of neurons.

On the one hand, this means that we can indeed describe a good chunk of activity with just a handful of dimensions. But on the other, it implies that recordings have to scale with the size of the targeted population in order to capture all that population’s shared dynamics. Which raises the obvious question: how do we know how big the targeted population is? But that’s a story for a different time.

Is this thing on?
There was so much more of course. Rafal Bogacz and crew kicked the year off by taking a different slant on the problem of how the brain could approximate backprop and hence learn like an artificial neural network. Their slant being: it doesn’t, that would be silly. Instead, they proposed that a network of neurons predicts what the neural activity at the end of learning should look like, and then change synaptic weights according to whether that prediction looks correct or not. We also had much more on how psychedelics alter brain function, including suggestions they desynchronise activity in the human brain. And if you like science cartography, there’s now a map of the whole of PubMed.

We also welcomed a new voice for neuroscience, The Transmitter, an ambitious online magazine offering us deep dives into neuroscience news and opinions, with that most unusual of things, a dedicated editorial team and a roster of journalists. Two examples of some great journalism this year: Shaena Montanari’s investigation into the whether simply flickering a light at 40Hz could clear Alzheimer’s brains of the amyloid plaques linked to the dementia, and Angie Voyles Askham’s deep dive into the controversy of whether its time to abandon one of the success stories of modern neuroscience, the reward prediction error theory of dopamine.

And, full disclosure, The Transmitter is also in my news this year: I’ve started a regular column there (apologies for the massive picture of my face that is at the end of the link — please scroll down quickly), kicking off with why averaging is holding back neuroscience and imagining the ultimate systems neuroscience paper.

You could sign up to follow me there for more in 2025. You could continue to mournfully scroll through your social media feed. Either way, all I can suggest is that, if you’re after good news in 2025, it’s probably best to stick to science.
