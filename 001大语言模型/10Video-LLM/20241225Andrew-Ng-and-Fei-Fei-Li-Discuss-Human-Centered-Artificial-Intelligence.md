[Andrew Ng and Fei-Fei Li Discuss Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence - Stanford Online - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNhC6Ox0T0o)

Andrew Ng: Hi, I'm delighted to have with us here today my old friend Professor Fei-Fei Li. Fei-Fei is a professor of computer science at Stanford University and also co-director of HAI, the Human Centered AI Institute, and previously she also was responsible for AI at Google Cloud as a chief scientist for the division. It's great to have you here Fei Fei. 

Andrew Ng：大家好，今天很高兴邀请到我的老朋友 Fei-Fei Li 教授。Fei-Fei 是斯坦福大学计算机科学的教授，也是 HAI（以人为本的 AI 研究院）的联合主任。她曾在 Google Cloud 担任首席科学家，负责 AI 相关工作。Fei-Fei，很高兴你能来。

Fei-Fei Li: Thank you Andrew. Very happy to be here.

Fei-Fei Li：谢谢你，Andrew。我很高兴能在这里和大家交流。

Andrew Ng: So I guess actually how long have you known each other? I've lost track. 

Andrew Ng：我在想，我们认识多久了？我都记不太清了。

Fei-Fei Li: Definitely more than a decade. I mean I've known your work right before we even met and I came to Stanford 2009 but we started talking 2007 so 15 years.

Fei-Fei Li：确实超过十年了。早在我们见面之前，我就已经知道你的工作。我 2009 年到了斯坦福，但我们从 2007 年就开始交流，所以已经有 15 年了。

Andrew Ng: I just still have very clear memories of how stressful it was when collectively you know bunch of us me Chris Manning bunch of us we're trying to figure out how to recruit you to come to Stanford.

Andrew Ng：我仍然清晰地记得，当时我们几个，包括我、Chris Manning 和其他一些同事，一起努力想办法邀请你加入斯坦福，这真是一段充满压力的时光。

Fei-Fei Li: It wasn't hard. I just needed to sort out my students and life, but it's hard to resist Stanford.

Fei-Fei Li：其实并不难。我只需要安顿学生和生活的事情，斯坦福实在是难以拒绝。

Andrew Ng: Isn't it really great having you as a friend and colleague here?

Andrew Ng：能在这里成为你的朋友和同事，真是太好了，不是吗？

Fei-Fei Li: Yeah, me too. It's been a long time and we're very lucky to be the generation seeing AI's great progress.

Fei-Fei Li：是的，我也有同感。我们这一代人真的很幸运，能够见证 AI 的巨大进步。

Andrew Ng: Okay, so there was something about your background that I always found inspiring, which is, you know, today people are entering AI from all walks of life, and sometimes people still wonder, oh, I majored in something or other. Is AI a right path for me? So I thought one of the most interesting parts of your background was that you actually started out not studying computer science or AI but you started out studying physics and then had this path to becoming one of the most globally recognizable AI scientists. So how did you make that switch from physics to AI?

Andrew Ng：我一直觉得你的经历很令人鼓舞。如今，各行各业的人都在进入 AI 领域。有时人们会想，我的专业背景适合进入 AI 吗？我觉得你背景中最有趣的部分之一是，你最初并不是学习计算机科学或 AI，而是物理学，然后逐渐成为全球知名的 AI 科学家。你是如何从物理学转到 AI 的呢？

Fei-Fei Li: Right, well that's a great question Andrew, especially both of us are passionate about young people's future and they come into the world of AI. The truth is, if I could enter AI back then, more than 20 years ago, today anybody can enter AI because AI has become such a prevalent and globally impactful technology. But myself, maybe I was an accident. So I have always been a physics kid or STEM kids. I'm sure you were too. But physics was my passion all the way through middle school, high school, college. I went to Princeton and majored in physics. And one thing physics has taught me till today is really the passion for asking big questions, the passion for seeking North Stars. And I was really having fun as a physics student at Princeton. And one thing I did was reading up stories and just writings of great physicists of the 20th century and just hear about what they think about the world, especially people like Albert Einstein, Roger Penrose, Irving Schrodinger. And it was really funny to notice that many of the writings towards the later half of the career of these great physicists were not about just the atomic world or the the physical world but ponderings about equally audacious questions like life like, like human conditions. You know, Schrodinger wrote this book, What is Life? And Roger Penrose wrote this book, Emperor's New Mind, right? And that really got me very curious about the topic of intelligence. So one thing led to another. During college time, I did intern at a couple of neuroscience labs, and especially vision-related. And I was like, wow, this is just as audacious a question to ask as the beginning of the universe or what is matter made of. And that got me to switch from undergraduate degree in physics to graduate degree in AI, even though, I don't know about you, during our time, AI was a dirty word. It was AI winter, so it was more machine learning and computer vision and computational neuroscience.

Fei-Fei Li：是的，Andrew，这是个很棒的问题，特别是我们都对年轻人的未来充满热情，他们进入了 AI 的世界。事实上，如果我能在 20 多年前进入 AI 领域，那么今天任何人都可以进入，因为 AI 已经变得非常普遍且对全球产生了深远影响。但对我来说，这可能是个偶然。我一直是个物理或 STEM 的孩子。我相信你也是。从中学、高中到大学，物理一直是我的热情所在。我去了普林斯顿大学，主修物理。物理一直激发我的是对大问题的热情，对寻找方向的热情。作为普林斯顿的物理学生，我真的过得很充实。我常常阅读 20 世纪伟大物理学家的故事和著作，了解他们对世界的看法，尤其是像 Albert Einstein、Roger Penrose 和 Irving Schrodinger 这样的人。有趣的是，这些伟大物理学家在职业生涯后期的许多著作不仅仅关注原子世界或物理世界，还思考同样大胆的问题，比如生命和人类状况。你知道吗，Schrodinger 写了《生命是什么？》，而 Roger Penrose 写了《皇帝的新脑》。这真的让我对智能这个话题产生了极大的好奇心。于是事情一步步发展下去。在大学期间，我的确在几个神经科学实验室实习，尤其是在视觉相关领域。我当时想，哇，这和宇宙的起源或者物质的构成一样，是个大胆的问题。这让我从物理学本科转向了 AI 研究生学位，尽管在我们那个时候，AI 是一个不太受欢迎的词汇。那是 AI 的寒冬，所以更多的是机器学习、计算机视觉和计算神经科学。

Andrew Ng: Yeah, I know. Honestly, I think when I was an undergrad, I was too busy writing code. I just managed to blithely ignore the AI winter and just kept on coding.

Andrew Ng：是的，我知道。老实说，当我还是本科生时，我忙于写代码，对 AI 寒冬几乎没有在意，只是不断地编程。

Fei-Fei Li: Yeah, well, I was too busy solving PDE equations.

Fei-Fei Li：是啊，当时我忙着解决 PDE 方程呢。

Andrew Ng: Hey, and so actually, do you have an audacious question now?

Andrew Ng：嘿，那你现在有什么大胆的问题吗？

Fei-Fei Li: Yes, my audacious question is still intelligence. I think since Alan Turing, humanity has not fully understand what is the fundamental computing principles behind intelligence. Today we use the words AI, we use the word AGI, but at the end of the day, I still dream of a set of simple equations or simple principles that can define the process of intelligence, whether it's animal intelligence or machine intelligence. And this is similar to physics. For example, many people have joined the analogy of flying, right? Are we replicating birds flying, or are we building an airplane? And a lot of people ask the question of the relationship between AI and brain. And to me, whether we're building a bird, or replicating a bird, or building an airplane, at the end of the day air dynamics and physics that govern the the the process of flying and I do believe one day we'll discover that.

Fei-Fei Li：是的，我仍然对智能有一个大胆的问题。我认为自 Alan Turing 以来，人类还未完全理解智能背后的基本计算原理。如今我们谈论 AI 和 AGI，但最终，我仍梦想着找到一套简单的方程或原理来定义智能的过程，无论是动物智能还是机器智能。这就像物理学中的飞行类比。比如，很多人探讨我们是在模仿鸟类飞行还是在制造飞机。很多人也问起 AI 与大脑之间的关系。对我来说，无论是制造鸟类、复制鸟类，还是打造飞机，飞行过程最终由空气动力学和物理学决定。我相信有一天我们会发现智能背后的这些原理。

Andrew Ng: I sometimes think about this you know one learning algorithm hypothesis could a lot of intelligence maybe not all but a lot of it be explained by one or or very simple machine learning principles. It feels like we're still so far from cracking that nut, but in the weekends when I have spare time, when I think about learning algorithms and where they could go, this is one of the things I still am excited about, just thinking about.

Andrew Ng：我有时会想，是否一个学习算法的假设可以解释大部分的智能，虽然不是全部，但很多智能可能通过简单的机器学习原理来理解。虽然感觉我们离解决这个问题还很遥远，但在周末有空时，我仍然喜欢思考学习算法及其未来发展方向，这始终让我感到兴奋。

Fei-Fei Li: I totally agree. I still feel like we are pre-Newtonian if we're doing physics analogy. Before Newton, there has been great physics, great physicists, a lot of phenomenology, a lot of studies of how the astral bodies move and all that, but it was Newton who started to write the very simple laws. And I think we are still going through that very exciting coming-of-age of AI as a basic science and We're pre-Newton In my opinion.

Fei-Fei Li：我完全同意。如果用物理学来类比，我觉得我们现在的阶段类似于牛顿之前的时代。在牛顿之前，虽然已经有了伟大的物理学成就和物理学家，研究了许多现象以及天体的运动，但直到牛顿才建立起简单明了的定律。我认为，在人工智能作为基础科学发展的过程中，我们还处于一个令人激动的成长阶段，就像物理学的牛顿前时代。

Andrew Ng: it's really nice to hear you talk about how despite machine learning and AI having come so far It still feels like there are a lot more unanswered questions a lot more work to be done By maybe some of the people joining the field today than work that's already been done.

Andrew Ng：听到你提到，尽管机器学习和 AI 已经取得了巨大的进步，但仍然有许多未解答的问题，还有很多工作等待去做，也许这正是今天加入这个领域的人们所面临的挑战，真的令人欣慰。

Fei-Fei Li: Absolutely. I mean, let's calculate. It's only, what, 60 years about? It's a very nascent field. Modern physics and chemistry and biology are all hundreds of years, right? so I think it is very it is very exciting to be entering the field of science of intelligence and studying AI today.

Fei-Fei Li：当然。打个比方，人工智能领域只有大约 60 年的历史，这还是一个新兴的领域。而现代的物理学、化学和生物学都有几百年的发展历史。因此，我认为能够投身于智能科学并在当今研究 AI 是一件非常令人兴奋的事情。

Andrew Ng: I remember chatting with the late professor John McCarthy who had coined the term artificial intelligence and boy the field has changed since when you know he conceived of it at the workshop and came up the term AI but maybe another ten years from now you know maybe someone watching this will come with a new set of ideas and then we'll be saying boy AI sure is different than what you know you and I thought it would be that that's an exciting future to build towards.

Andrew Ng：我记得和已故的 John McCarthy 教授交谈时，他是「人工智能」这个术语的创造者。自从他在研讨会上提出 AI 这个概念以来，这个领域已经发生了很大的变化。也许在未来十年内，某位正在观看这个视频的人会带来一套新的理念。到那时，我们可能会感叹，AI 真的是与我们现在所想象的截然不同。这样的未来确实令人期待。

Fei-Fei Li: yeah I'm sure Newton would have not dreamed of uh einstein so you know our our evolution of science uh sometimes takes strides sometimes takes a while and i think we're absolutely in a in an exciting phase of ai right now.

Fei-Fei Li：我相信，牛顿肯定无法想象爱因斯坦的出现。科学的发展有时会迅速前进，有时则需要较长时间。我认为我们现在正处于一个令人兴奋的 AI 阶段。

Andrew Ng: you know it's interesting hearing you paint this grand vision for AI. Going back a little bit, there was one of the pieces of your background that I found inspiring, which is when you're just getting started, I've heard you speak about how you're a physics student, but not only that, you're also running a laundromat to pay for school. And so just tell us more about that.

Andrew Ng：很高兴听到你描绘 AI 的宏伟愿景。回到过去，我觉得你背景中的一个细节很鼓舞人心：在你刚开始的时候，我听说你不仅是一名物理学学生，还通过经营一家洗衣店来支付学费。能和我们分享更多这方面的经历吗？

Fei-Fei Li: So I came to this country, to New Jersey actually when I was 15. One thing great about being in New Jersey is it was close to Princeton, so I often just take a weekend trip with my parents and to admire the place where Einstein spent most of his career in the latter half of his life but you know with typical immigrant life and it was tough and by the time I entered Princeton my parents didn't speak English and one thing led to another. It turns out running a dry cleaner might be the best option for my family, especially for me to lead that business because it's a weakened business. If it's a weekday business, it would be hard for me to be a student. And it's actually, believe it or not, running a dry cleaning shop is very machine heavy which is good for a STEM student like me. So we decided to open a dry cleaner shop in a small town in New Jersey called Pursipity, New Jersey. It turned out we were physically not too far from Bell Labs and where lots of early convolutional neural network research was happening, but I had no idea.

李飞飞：我在 15 岁时来到美国，定居在新泽西。新泽西的一个好处是离普林斯顿很近，所以我常常和父母在周末去那里游玩，欣赏爱因斯坦在他生命后半段主要工作的地方。不过，作为移民，我们的生活并不轻松。当我进入普林斯顿时，我的父母还不会说英语，而种种原因促使我们选择了经营干洗店。对我们家来说，干洗店是一个不错的选择，尤其对我而言，因为它主要在周末营业，这样我在平日可以专心学习。你可能想不到，经营干洗店需要使用很多机器，这对我这样的 STEM 学生来说正合适。因此，我们决定在新泽西一个名为普西皮提的小镇开一家干洗店。后来才发现，原来我们离贝尔实验室不远，那时那里正进行着许多卷积神经网络的早期研究，但我当时对此一无所知。

Andrew Ng: I was actually a summer intern at AT&T Bell Labs way back.

Andrew Ng：实际上，我早年间曾在 AT&T Bell Labs 做暑期实习。

Fei-Fei Li: That's right, With Rob Shapiro.

Fei-Fei Li：没错，和 Rob Shapiro 一起。

Andrew Ng: With Michael Kearns was my mentor, and Rob Shapiro, inventor of Bruce Singh, great algorithms. 

Andrew Ng：Michael Kearns 是我的导师，还有 Bruce Singh 的发明者 Rob Shapiro，他创造了优秀的算法。

Fei-Fei Li: See, you're coding AI. I was trying to clean clothes.

Fei-Fei Li：你看，你在编写 AI。我却在试图洗衣服。

Andrew Ng: No, no, no. Not very far. Only much later in my life did I start interning.

Andrew Ng：不，没有那么久。直到我人生的后期，我才开始实习。

Fei-Fei Li: Yeah, and then it was seven years. I did that for the entire undergrad and most of my grad school, and I hired my parents. Yeah.

Fei-Fei Li：是的，这一做就是七年。我整个本科期间和大部分研究生阶段都在这样做，我还雇用了我的父母。是的。

Andrew Ng: Yeah, no, that's really inspiring. I think, you know, I know you've been brilliant and doing exciting work all your life, and I think the story of, you know, running a laundromat to globally prominent computer scientists, I hope that inspires some people watching this, that no matter where you are, there's plenty of room for everyone. Exactly, yeah.

Andrew Ng：是的，那真是令人振奋。我知道你一直以来都在从事精彩的工作，而你的经历 —— 从经营洗衣店到成为全球知名的计算机科学家 —— 我希望能够激励到观看这个节目的每一个人，让大家明白无论身处何地，世界都为每个人提供了足够的机会。确实如此。

Don't even notice, my high school job was an office admin. that no matter where you are, there's plenty of room for everyone. Don't even know this, my high school job was an office admin. So to this day, I remember doing a lot of photocopying. And the exciting part was using the shredder. That was the glamorous part. But I was doing so much photocopying in high school, I thought, boy, if only I could build a robot to do this photocopying, maybe I could do something else.

回想起来，我在高中时的工作是一名办公室管理员。无论身处何地，总会有足够的空间供大家施展才华。在这份工作中，我做了大量的复印工作，而使用碎纸机则是其中最有趣的部分。由于高中时复印的工作量很大，我曾想，如果能发明一个机器人来完成这些复印任务，那我就可以腾出时间去做其他事情了。

Fei-Fei Li: Did you succeed?

Fei-Fei Li：你觉得自己成功了吗？

Andrew Ng: I'm still working on it. We'll see. And then, you know, when people think about you and the work you've done, one of the huge successes everyone thinks about is ImageNet, right, where Hub established early benchmark for computer vision. It was really completely instrumental to the modern rise of deep learning and computer vision. One thing I bet not many people know about is how you actually got started on ImageNet. So tell us the origin story of ImageNet.

Andrew Ng：我还在努力中，看看结果如何吧。你知道，当人们谈到你和你的成就时，大家首先想到的就是 ImageNet，对吧？这个项目在早期为计算机视觉设立了一个重要的基准，对现代深度学习和计算机视觉的发展起到了至关重要的作用。我想很多人可能不知道你是如何开始 ImageNet 的。能不能和我们分享一下 ImageNet 的起源故事？

Fei-Fei Li: Yeah, well, Andrew, that's a good question, because a lot of people see ImageNet as just labeling a ton of images, but where we began was really going after North Star brings back my physics background. So when I entered grad school, when did you enter grad school? Which year?

Fei-Fei Li：嗯，Andrew，这是个好问题，因为很多人只是将 ImageNet 视为一个给海量图像贴标签的项目，但我们的起点实际上与一个名为「北极星」的理念有关，这让我想起了我的物理学背景。那么，你进入研究生院时，你是哪一年进入的？

Andrew Ng: 97.

Andrew Ng：1997 年。

Fei-Fei Li: Okay, I was three years later than you, 2000. And that was a very exciting period because I was in the computer vision and computational neuroscience lab of Pietro Perona and Christoph Koch at Caltech. And leading up to that, there has been, first of all, two things was very exciting. One is that the world of AI at that point wasn't called AI. Computer vision or natural language processing has found its lingua de franco, its machine learning. Statistical modeling as a new tool has emerged, right? I mean, it's been around.

Fei-Fei Li：好吧，我是在 2000 年，比你晚了三年。那段时间非常激动人心，因为我在加州理工学院的 Pietro Perona 和 Christoph Koch 的计算机视觉与计算神经科学实验室工作。在此之前，有两件事情特别令人兴奋。首先，那时的 AI 领域并不叫 AI。计算机视觉和自然语言处理找到了它们的共同语言：机器学习。虽然统计建模作为一种新工具已经存在了一段时间，但它的出现为这个领域注入了新的活力。

Andrew Ng: And I remember when the idea of applying machine learning to computer vision, that was like a controversial thing.

Andrew Ng：我记得，当初把机器学习应用到计算机视觉领域的想法出来时，这曾是一个颇具争议的话题。

Fei-Fei Li: Right. And I was the first generation of graduate students who were embracing all the base net, all the inference algorithms, and all that. And that was one exciting happening. Second exciting happening that most people don't know and don't appreciate is that a couple of decades, probably more than two or three decades, of incredible cognitive science and cognitive neuroscience work in the field of vision, in the world of vision, human vision, that has really established a couple of really critical North Star problems, just understanding human visual processing and human intelligence. And one of them is the recognition of understanding of natural objects and natural things. Because a lot of the psychology and cognitive science work is pointing to us that is an innately optimized, whatever that word is, functionality and ability of human intelligence. It's more robust, faster, and more nuanced than we had thought. We even find neural correlates, brain areas, devoted to faces or places or body parts. So these two things led to my PhD study of using machine learning methods to work on real-world object recognition. But it became very painful very quickly that we are banging against one of the most, continue to be the most important challenge in AI and machine learning is the lack of generalizability. You can design a beautiful model all you want if you're overfitting that model.

Fei-Fei Li：是的。当时我作为第一代研究生，开始接受并研究各类基础网络和推理算法。这是一件令人振奋的事情。还有一件大多数人不太了解或重视的事情，那就是在过去的二、三十年中，认知科学和认知神经科学在视觉领域取得了非凡的成就。这些研究工作在理解人类视觉处理和人类智能方面，确立了几个关键的问题。其中一个重要问题就是对自然物体和事物的识别与理解。心理学和认知科学的研究表明，这种能力是人类智能的一种本能且高度优化的功能，比我们之前认为的更为稳健、迅速和细腻。研究甚至发现了大脑中专门负责面孔、地方或身体部位识别的区域。因此，这些发现促使我在博士研究中采用机器学习方法来解决现实世界中的物体识别问题。然而，我们很快遇到了一个持续至今的重大挑战，那就是 AI 和机器学习领域中普适性不足的问题（泛化不足）。即使你设计出了一个很好的模型，如果过拟合，模型的效果也会大打折扣。

Andrew Ng: I remember when it used to be possible to publish a computer vision paper, showing your words on one image. 

Andrew Ng：我记得以前只需在一幅图像上展示你的研究，就可以发表一篇计算机视觉的论文。

Fei-Fei Li: Exactly. Yeah, it's just the overfitting. The models are not very expressive, and we lack the data. And we also, as a field, was betting on making the variables very rich by hand-engineered features. Remember, every variable carrying a ton of semantic meaning, but with hand-engineered features. So and then towards the end of my PhD, my advisor Pietro and I start to look at each other and say, well, boy, we need more data. If we believe in this North Star problem of object recognition, and we look back at the tools we have, you know, mathematically speaking, we're overfitting every model we're encountering. We need to take a fresh look at this. mathematically speaking we're overfitting every model we're encountering we need to take a fresh look at this so one thing led to another he and I decided we'll just do a at that point we think it was a large-scale data project called Caltech 101.

Fei-Fei Li：没错，这正是过拟合的问题。模型的表达能力有限，而我们也缺乏足够的数据。在那个领域，我们试图通过手工设计特征来丰富变量。你还记得吗？每个变量都承载着大量的语义信息，而这些信息是通过手工设计的特征来实现的。到我博士快毕业的时候，我和我的导师 Pietro 开始意识到，我们需要更多的数据。如果我们相信物体识别是我们的目标，那么回顾我们现有的工具，就会发现我们所遇到的每个模型都存在过拟合的问题。于是，我们决定重新审视这个问题，并开始一个当时认为是大规模的数据项目，称为 Caltech 101。

Andrew Ng: I remember the data set I wrote papers using you know your Caltech 101.

Andrew Ng：我记得我曾用你的 Caltech 101 数据集写过几篇论文。

Fei-Fei Li: you did you and your early graduate student. 

Fei-Fei Li：是的，你和你早期的研究生曾经做过这些工作。

Andrew Ng: You helped benefit a lot of researchers, Caltech 101 data set.

Andrew Ng：你为许多研究人员提供了帮助，尤其是通过 Caltech 101 数据集。

Fei-Fei Li: That was me and my mom labeling images, and a couple of undergrads. But that was the early days of internet. So suddenly, the availability of data was a new thing. I remember Pietro still have this super expensive digital camera. I think it was Canon or something like $6,000 walking around Caltech taking pictures. But we are the internet generation. I go to Google image search, I start to see these thousands and tens of thousands of images and I tell Pietro let's just download. Of course it's not that easy to download so one thing led to another. We built this Caltech 101 data set of 101 object categories and about I would say 30 to 50, 30,000 pictures.

Fei-Fei Li：那是我和我妈妈，还有一些本科生一起标记图像的时候。但那时正是互联网的早期时代，数据的可用性突然成为一个新鲜事物。我记得 Pietro 当时有一台非常昂贵的数码相机，可能是佳能的，大约值 6,000 美元，他在 Caltech 拍照。但我们属于互联网一代，我去 Google 图片搜索，看到成千上万的图像，我对 Pietro 说，我们下载这些吧。当然，下载并不容易，因此我们想出了各种办法。最终，我们建立了这个 Caltech 101 数据集，包含 101 个对象类别和大约 3 万到 5 万张图片。

Andrew Ng: I think it's really interesting that you know even though everyone's heard of ImageNet today, even you kind of took a couple iterations where you did Caltech 101 and that was a success. Lots of people used it but it's the even the early learnings from building Caltech 101 that gave you the basis to build what turned out to be even an even bigger.

Andrew Ng：我觉得很有趣的是，虽然今天大家都知道 ImageNet，但在这之前你经历了几次迭代，比如 Caltech 101 就取得了成功。许多人使用了 Caltech 101，而正是从这次的早期学习中，你打下了基础，最终开发出了更大规模的项目。

Fei-Fei Li: Right, except that by the time we started, I became an assistant professor. We started to look at the problem, and realized it's way bigger than we think. Just mathematically speaking, Caltech 101 was not sufficient to power the algorithms. We decided to do ImageNet, and that was the time people started to think we're doing too much. It's just too crazy. The idea of downloading the entire Internet of Images and mapping out all the English nouns was a little bit, I start to get a lot of pushback. I remember at one of the CVPR conference when I presented the early idea of ImageNet, a couple of researchers publicly questioned and said, if you cannot recognize one category of object, let's say the chair you're sitting in, how do you imagine, or what's the use of a data set of 22,000 classes and 15 million images?

Fei-Fei Li：是的，不过当我们开始这个项目时，我已经成为助理教授。我们开始研究这个问题，并意识到它比想象中要复杂得多。单从数学角度讲，Caltech 101 并不足以支撑这些算法的需求。于是我们决定创建 ImageNet，当时人们开始认为我们做的事情过于庞大，甚至有些疯狂。试图下载全网的图像并将所有英文名词进行映射，这个想法确实有些大胆。我开始遇到很多反对声音。我记得在一次 CVPR 会议上，我展示了 ImageNet 的早期构想时，有几位研究人员公开质疑：如果连一种物体类别都无法识别，比如你坐的椅子，那么拥有 22,000 个类别和 1,500 万张图像的数据集又有什么意义呢？

Andrew Ng: Yeah, but in the end, that giant data set unlocked a lot of value for countless number of researchers around the world.

Andrew Ng：是的，但最终，这个庞大的数据集为全球无数研究人员创造了巨大的价值。

Fei-Fei Li: Well, I think it was the combination of betting on the right North Star problem and the data that drives it. So it was a fun process.

Fei-Fei Li：嗯，我认为这得益于我们选择了正确的核心问题，并找到了合适的数据来支持这个问题。所以这个过程非常有趣。

Andrew Ng: Yeah, and to me, when I think about that story, it seems like one of those examples where, you know, sometimes people feel like they should only work on projects that are the huge thing at the first outset, but I feel like for people working machine learning if your first project is a bit smaller it's totally fine have a good win use the learnings to build up to even bigger things and then sometimes you get a you know image net size win all of it.

Andrew Ng：是的，我觉得这个故事说明了一个道理：有时候人们认为自己应该一开始就参与那些大型项目，但对从事机器学习的人来说，初期项目小一点也没关系。重要的是积累成功经验，然后利用这些经验去实现更大的目标，有时候甚至能取得像 ImageNet 那样的巨大成功。

Fei-Fei Li: well but in the meantime I think it's also important to be driven by an audacious goal though you know you can size your problem or size your project as local milestones and so on along this journey but I also look at some of our current students they're so peer pressured by this current climate of publishing nonstop. It becomes more incremental papers to just get into a publication for the sake of it. And I personally always push my students to ask the question, what is the North Star that's driving you?

Fei-Fei Li：嗯，但我认为，设定一个大胆的目标来驱动自己是非常重要的。虽然在这个过程中，你可以将问题或项目分解成局部的里程碑，但我也注意到我们的一些学生在当前不断发表文章的环境中，感受到了同龄人的压力。这导致他们为了发表而发表，仅仅是写一些增量的论文。我个人总是鼓励我的学生去思考，是什么在引领着你前进？

Andrew Ng: Yeah, that's true. You're right. For myself, when I do research over the years I've always pretty much done what I'm excited about where I want to you know try to push the field forward doesn't it don't listen to people I have to listen people let them shape your opinion but in the end I think the best research is let the world shape their opinion but in the end drag things forward using their own opinion. Totally agree. It's your own inner fire, right? So as your research program developed, you've wound up taking your, let's say, foundations in computer vision and neuroscience and applying to all sorts of topics including very visibly healthcare, look at neuroscience applications. Would love to hear a bit more about that.

Andrew Ng：是的，没错。对我来说，多年来做研究时，我总是专注于让我兴奋的事情，努力推动这个领域的发展。尽管我会听取别人的意见并让他们影响我的看法，但我认为最好的研究还是应该在世界的影响下，坚持自己的观点来推动进步。我完全同意，这是你内心的激情，对吧？随着你的研究项目的发展，你已经将计算机视觉和神经科学的基础应用到许多领域，包括显著的医疗保健和神经科学应用。很想多了解一些这方面的情况。

Fei-Fei Li: Yeah, happy to. I think the evolution of my research in computer vision also kind of follows the evolution of visual intelligence in animals and there are two topics that truly excites me. One is what is a truly impactful application area that would help human lives and that's my healthcare work the other one is what is vision at the end of the day about and that brings me to the the trying to close the loop between perception and robotic learning so on the healthcare side, you know, one thing, Andrew, there was a number that shocked me about 10 years ago when I met my long-term collaborator, Dr. Arne Milstein at Stanford Medical School. And that number is about a quarter of a million Americans die of medical errors every year. I had never imagined a number being that high due to medical errors there are many many reasons but we can rest assured most of the reasons are not intentional these are her errors of unintended you know mistakes and and so on for That's a mind-boggling number.

Fei-Fei Li：当然，我很乐意分享。我在计算机视觉方面的研究演变有点像动物视觉智能的发展，其中有两个令我特别感兴趣的主题。一个是能对人类生活产生重大影响的应用领域，这就是我在医疗健康方面的工作；另一个是探究视觉的本质，这促使我努力在感知和机器人学习之间建立联系。在医疗健康领域，有一个数据让我印象深刻。大约十年前，我在斯坦福医学院认识了长期合作伙伴 Dr. Arne Milstein，当时了解到每年大约有 25 万美国人因医疗错误而去世。我从未想到这个数字会如此之高。导致这种情况的原因很多，但可以肯定，大部分并非故意，而是无意中的失误。这一统计数据实在令人震惊。

Andrew Ng: It is. It's about 40,000 deaths a year from automotive accidents, which is completely tragic and this is even vastly greater.

Andrew Ng：是的，每年大约有 40,000 人因汽车事故而丧生，这本身就是一个悲惨的数字，而医院感染导致的死亡人数更是惊人。

Fei-Fei Li: I was going to say that. I'm glad you brought it up. Just one example, one number within that mind-boggling number is the number of hospital acquired infection resulted fatality is more than 95,000 that is more than that's 2.5 times than the death of car accidents and and in this particular case hospital car infection is a result of many things but by enlarged lack of good hand hygiene practice so if you look at WHO there has been a lot of protocols about clinicians hand hygiene practice but in real healthcare delivery the when things get busy and when the process is tedious and when there is a lack of feedback system you still make a lot of mistakes another medical tragic medical fact is that more than 70 billion dollars every year are spent in in full resulted injuries and fatalities and most of this happened to elderlies at home but also in the hospital rooms and these are huge issues and when arnie and i got together back in 2012 it was the height of self-driving car um let's say not hype but what's the word right word excitement in Silicon Valley. And then we look at the technology of smart sensing cameras, LIDARs, radars, whatever,

Fei-Fei Li：我正想提到这个，很高兴你说到了。一个让人震惊的事实是，医院内感染导致的死亡人数超过 95,000，是车祸死亡人数的 2.5 倍。在这种情况下，许多医院感染是由于缺乏良好的手部卫生习惯造成的。虽然 WHO 制定了许多临床医生的手部卫生标准，但在实际医疗中，由于繁忙的工作、繁琐的程序以及缺乏反馈系统，仍然容易出现错误。另一个令人痛心的医学事实是，每年因跌倒导致的伤害和死亡花费超过 700 亿美元，这些事件多发生在老年人的家中和医院病房。这些都是重大问题。当 arnie 和我在 2012 年聚在一起时，正值硅谷对自动驾驶汽车的热情高涨。于是我们关注起智能感应相机、LIDAR 和雷达等技术，

smart sensors, machine learning algorithm, and holistic understanding of a complex environment with high stakes for human lives. I was looking at all that for a self-driving car and realized in healthcare delivery we have the same situation. Much of the process, the human behavior process of healthcare is in the dark and if we could have smart sensors, be it in patient rooms or senior homes, to help our clinicians and patients to stay safer that would be amazing so Arne and I embarked on this what we call ambient intelligence research agenda but one thing I learned which probably will lead to our other topics is as soon as you're applying AI to real human conditions, there's a lot of human issues in addition to machine learning issues, for example, privacy.

智能传感器、机器学习算法以及对复杂环境的全面理解，对于保障人类生命安全至关重要。在研究自动驾驶汽车时，我意识到，医疗服务领域同样面临类似的挑战。许多医疗过程中人类行为的细节仍然不为人知。如果我们能在病房或养老院等场所安装智能传感器，帮助医生和患者提高安全性，那将是非常有意义的。因此，Arne 和我启动了我们所谓的环境智能研究计划。然而，我也发现，当我们将 AI 应用于实际的人类情境时，除了机器学习的问题之外，还会涉及许多人类问题，例如隐私问题。

Andrew Ng: And I remember reading some of your papers with Arnie and found it really interesting how you could build and deploy systems that were relatively privacy-preserving.

Andrew Ng：我记得读过你和 Arnie 合写的一些论文，觉得你们在构建和部署相对隐私保护的系统方面非常有趣。

Fei-Fei Li: Yeah, well, thank you. Well, the first iteration of that technology is we use cameras that do not capture RGB information. You've used a lot of that in self-driving cars, the depth cameras for example. And there you preserve a lot of privacy information just by not seeing the faces and the identity of the people. But what's really interesting over the past decade is the changes of technology is actually giving us a bigger tool set for privacy preserved computing in this condition. For example, on-device inference, you know, as the chips getting more and more powerful, if you don't have to transmit any data through the network and to the central server, you help people better. Federated learning, we know it's still early stage, but that's another potential tool for privacy, preserve computing, and then differential privacy and also encryption technologies. So we're starting to see that human demand, privacy and other issues, is driving actually a new wave of machine learning technology in ambient intelligence in healthcare.

Fei-Fei Li：是的，谢谢。这个技术的初始版本是使用不捕捉 RGB 信息的相机。比如在自动驾驶汽车中，常用的深度相机就是这样。由于这些相机不识别人脸和身份信息，因此在很大程度上保护了隐私。过去十年，技术的进步为隐私保护计算带来了更多的工具。例如，随着芯片性能的提升，设备上的推理技术可以在不通过网络传输数据的情况下保护用户隐私。虽然联邦学习仍处于早期阶段，但它是隐私保护计算的另一种潜在工具，此外还有差分隐私和加密技术。因此，我们看到人们对隐私的需求正在推动医疗保健领域中环境智能的新一波机器学习技术的发展。

Andrew Ng: Yeah, that's really, yeah. I've been encouraged to see the real practical applications of differential privacy that are actually real. Federated learning, as you said, probably the PR is a little bit ahead of the reality, but I think we'll get there. But it's interesting how consumers in the last several years have fortunately gotten much more knowledgeable about privacy and are increasingly demanding.

Andrew Ng：是的，确实如此。我很高兴看到差分隐私的实际应用已经成为现实。正如你所说，联邦学习的宣传可能有些超前于实际情况，但我相信我们会取得进展。有趣的是，消费者在过去几年对隐私的了解明显增加，并且要求也越来越高。

Fei-Fei Li: So important. I think the public is also making us to be better scientists.

Fei-Fei Li：这非常重要。我认为公众正在促使我们成为更优秀的科学家。

Andrew Ng: Yeah. And I think ultimately, you know, people understand AI holds everyone, including us, but holds everyone accountable for really doing the right thing.

Andrew Ng：是的。我认为最终，人们明白 AI 促使所有人，包括我们在内，都对真正做正确的事情负责。

Fei-Fei Li: Yeah.

Fei-Fei Li：是的。

Andrew Ng: And, you know, and on that note, one of the really interesting pieces of work you've been doing has been leading several efforts to help educate legislators or help governments, especially U.S. government, work toward better laws and better regulation, especially as it relates to AI. That sounds like very important and I suspect some days of the week I would guess somewhat frustrating work, but we'd love to hear more about that.

Andrew Ng：关于这个话题，你一直在从事一项非常有意义的工作，领导多个项目来教育立法者或协助政府，特别是美国政府，制定更好的法律和监管，尤其是涉及 AI 的领域。这项工作听起来非常重要，我也想这可能在某些时候会让人感到有些沮丧。我们很想了解更多这方面的情况。

Fei-Fei Li: Yeah, so I think first of all, I have to credit many, many people. So about four years ago, and I was actually finishing my sabbatical from Google time, I was very privileged to work with so many businesses, enterprise developers, just a large number and variety of vertical industries realizing AI's human impact. That was when many faculty leaders at Stanford and also just our president provost, former president and former provost all get together and realize there is a role, historical role, that Stanford needs to play in advances of AI. We were part of the birthplace of AI. You know, a lot of work our previous generation have done, and a lot of work you've done and some of the work I've done led to AI, today's AI. What is our historical opportunity and responsibility? With that, we believe that the next generation of AI education and research and policy needs to be human centered and having established the human center AI Institute what we call HAI one of the work that really took me outside of my comfort zone or aiding expertise is really a deeper engagement with policy thinkers and makers because you know we're here in Silicon Valley and there is a culture in Silicon Valley is we just keep making things and the law will catch up by itself but AI is impacting human lives and some sometimes negatively so rapidly that it is not good for any of us if we the experts are not at the table with the policy thinkers and makers to really try to make this technology better for the people. I mean we're talking about fairness, we're talking about privacy, we also are talking about the brain drain of AI to industry and the concentration of data and compute in a small number of technology companies, all these are really part of the changes of our time. Some are really exciting changes. Some have profound impact that we cannot necessarily predict yet. So one of the policy work that Stanford HAI has very proudly engaged in is we were one of the leading universities that lobbied a bill called the National AI Research Cloud Task Force bill. It changed the name from Research Cloud to Research Resource. So now the bill's acronym is NAIR, National AI Research Resource. And this bill is calling for a task force to put together a roadmap for America's public sector, especially higher education and research sector, to increase their access to resource for AI compute and AI data. It really is aimed to rejuvenate America's ecosystem in AI innovation and research. And I'm on the 12-person task force under Biden administration for this bill and we hope that's a piece of policy that is not a regulatory policy it's more an incentive policy to build and rejuvenate ecosystems.

Fei-Fei Li：是的，所以首先，我要致谢许多人。大约四年前，我刚刚结束了在 Google 的休假期间，有幸与许多企业开发者合作，涉及大量和各种垂直行业，意识到 AI 对人类生活的影响。那时，斯坦福大学的许多教职领导者，以及我们的校长、教务长、前校长和前教务长都聚集在一起，意识到斯坦福在 AI 的进步中需要扮演一个历史角色。斯坦福是 AI 的发源地之一。你知道，我们上一代人所做的很多工作，以及你们和我所做的一些工作，促成了今天的 AI。我们面临怎样的历史机遇和责任？因此，我们相信下一代的 AI 教育、研究和政策需要以人为中心，我们成立了被称为 HAI 的人类中心 AI 研究所。其中一项让我真正走出舒适区并提供专业支持的工作是与政策思想家和制定者进行更深入的互动，因为你知道我们在硅谷，这里的文化是我们不断地创造东西，而法律会自行赶上，但 AI 对人类生活的影响如此迅速，有时是负面的，如果我们专家不与政策思想家和制定者坐在一起，真正努力使这项技术更好地服务于人，那对我们所有人都不利。我的意思是，我们在谈论公平，我们在谈论隐私，我们也在谈论 AI 向产业的脑力流失以及数据和计算资源在少数科技公司中的集中，所有这些都是我们时代变革的一部分。有些变化真的很令人兴奋。有些则具有深远的影响，我们尚无法完全预测。因此，斯坦福 HAI 非常自豪地参与了一项政策工作，我们是推动一项名为国家 AI 研究云工作组法案的领先大学之一。它的名称从研究云变为研究资源。所以现在该法案的缩写是 NAIR，国家 AI 研究资源。该法案要求成立一个工作组，为美国的公共部门，特别是高等教育和研究部门，制定一份路线图，以增加他们获取 AI 计算和 AI 数据资源的机会。它真正旨在振兴美国的 AI 创新和研究生态系统。我在拜登政府下的这个 12 人的工作组中，我们希望这是一项不是监管政策而是激励政策的政策，以建立和振兴生态系统。

Andrew Ng: I'm glad that you're doing this to help shape US policy and this type of making sure enough resources are allocated to you know ensure healthy development of AI. It feels like this is something that every country needs at this point. So, you know, just from the things that you are doing by yourself, not to speak of the things that the global AI community is doing, there's just so much going on in AI right now. So many opportunities, so much excitement. I found that for someone getting started in machine learning for the first time, sometimes there's so much going on they can almost feel a little bit overwhelming. What advice do you have for someone getting started in machine learning?

Andrew Ng：我很高兴你正在帮助制定美国的政策，以确保有足够的资源用于支持 AI 的健康发展。我认为这是目前每个国家都需要关注的事情。你知道，单是你自己在做的事情，就已经很多了，更不用说全球 AI 社区的努力。AI 领域现在充满了各种机遇和令人振奋的进展。我发现，对刚开始接触机器学习的人来说，可能会因为各种信息而感到不知所措。对于这样的人，你有什么建议吗？

Fei-Fei Li: Great question Andrew. I'm sure you have great advice. You're one of the world-known advocate for AI machine learning education. So I do get this question a lot as well. And one thing you're totally right is AI really today feels different from our time. During our time.

Fei-Fei Li：Andrew，你问得很好。我相信你一定有很好的建议。作为世界知名的 AI 机器学习教育倡导者，我也经常被问到这个问题。有一点你说得很对，那就是今天的人工智能确实与我们那个时代感觉不同。在我们那个时代。

Andrew Ng: Today, just for the record, now is still our time.

Andrew Ng：今天，作为记录，现在依然是我们的时代。

Fei-Fei Li: Just you. That's true. When we were starting in AI. I love that. Exactly. We're still part of this. When we got started, the entrance to AI and machine learning was relatively narrow. You almost have to start from computer science angle. As a physics major, I still had to wedge myself into the computer science track or electrical engineering track to get to AI. But today I actually think that there is many aspect of AI that that creates entry points for people from all walks of life. On the technical side, I think it's obvious that there's just an incredible plethora of resources out there on the internet, from Coursera to YouTube to TikTok to GitHub. There's just so much that students worldwide can learn about AI and machine learning compared to the time we began learning machine learning and also any campuses we're not talking about just college campuses we're talking about high school campuses even sometimes earlier we're starting to see more more available classes and resources. So I think there is, I do encourage those of the young people with the technical interest and resource and opportunity to embrace these resources because it's a lot of fun. But having said that, for those of you who are not coming from a technical angle, who still are passionate about AI, whether it's the downstream application or the creativity it engenders or the policy and social angle or important social problems, whether it's digital economics or the governance or history, ethics, political sciences, I do invite you to join us because there is a lot of work to be done. There is a lot of unknown questions. For example, my colleague at HAI are questioning, are trying to find answers on how do you define our economy in the digital age? What does it mean when robots software are participating in the workflow more and more? How do you measure our economy? That's not an AI coding question. That is an AI impact question. We're looking at the incredible advances of generative AI. And there will be more. What does that mean for creativity? And to the creators, from music to art to writing, I think there is a lot of concerns concerns and I think it's rightfully so but in the meantime it takes people together to figure this out and also to use this new tool. So I think in short I just think it's a it's a very exciting time and anybody with any walks of life as long as you're passionate about this there's a role to play.

Fei-Fei Li：仅仅是你说的。没错。回想我们刚开始接触 AI 的时候，我非常喜欢那段时间。确实如此，我们仍然是这个领域的一部分。最初，我们进入 AI 和机器学习的途径是相对狭窄的。几乎必须从计算机科学的角度切入。作为一名物理专业的学生，我也不得不转到计算机科学或电气工程去学习 AI。然而，现在我觉得，AI 的很多方面为各行各业的人们创造了新的进入点。在技术方面，显然互联网上有着极为丰富的资源，从 Coursera 到 YouTube，再到 TikTok 和 GitHub。与我们那个时代相比，现在的学生能学到更多关于 AI 和机器学习的知识。不仅是在大学校园，甚至在高中，甚至更早的阶段，我们就能看到越来越多的课程和资源。因此，我鼓励那些对技术感兴趣并且有资源和机会的年轻人去利用这些资源，因为学习这些内容真的很有趣。不过，对于那些不是从技术角度出发但仍对 AI 充满热情的人来说，无论是关注其应用、创造力，还是政策与社会问题，比如数字经济、治理、历史、伦理和政治学，我都欢迎你们加入我们，因为有很多事情需要去做，还有很多未知的问题等待解答。比如，我在 HAI 的同事们正尝试回答一些问题，比如在数字时代如何定义我们的经济。当越来越多的机器人软件参与到工作流程中时，这意味着什么？我们该如何衡量我们的经济？这些都不是 AI 编码的问题，而是 AI 对社会影响的问题。我们正在见证生成式 AI 的巨大进步，而且未来还会有更多。这对创造力意味着什么？对于从事音乐、艺术到写作的创作者们来说，担忧是可以理解的。但与此同时，我们需要共同努力去理解并利用这个新工具。所以我认为，简而言之，当前是一个非常令人兴奋的时代，只要你对此充满热情，无论你来自何种背景，都有你的用武之地。

Andrew Ng: Yeah, and that's really exciting. When you talk about economics, think about, you know, my conversations with Professor Eric Bryn Austin, right, studying impact of AI on the economy. But from what you're saying, and I agree, it seems like no matter what your current interests are, AI is such a general-purpose technology that the combination of your current interests are, AI is such a general purpose technology that the combination of your current interest and AI is often promising. 

Andrew Ng：是的，这确实令人感到兴奋。谈到经济学时，我会想到与 Eric Bryn Austin 教授关于 AI 对经济影响的对话。但正如你所说，我也同意，不管你目前的兴趣是什么，AI 作为一种通用技术，通常都能与之结合产生有前景的结果。

And I find that even for learners that may not yet have a specific interest, if you find your way into AI, start learning things, often the interest will evolve and then you can start to craft your own path. And given where AI is today, there's still so much room and so much need for a lot more people to craft their own paths to do this exciting work that I think the world still needs a lot more of.

我发现，即使是对 AI 还没有明确兴趣的学习者，在开始接触和学习后，往往会逐渐产生兴趣，然后就能规划出自己的发展路径。鉴于 AI 目前的发展状况，还有很大的空间和需求，需要更多人来参与这项激动人心的工作。

Fei-Fei Li: I totally agree.

Fei-Fei Li：我完全同意。

Andrew Ng: So one piece of work that you did that I thought was very cool was starting a program, initially called Sailors and then later AI for All which was really reaching out to you know high school and even younger students to try to give them more opportunities in AI including people of all walks of life. I'd love to hear more about that.

Andrew Ng：你曾启动了一个非常酷的项目，最初名为 Sailors，后来改名为 AI for All。这个项目旨在为高中生甚至更年轻的学生提供更多接触 AI 的机会，覆盖各个社会阶层的人。我很想了解更多关于这个项目的信息。

Fei-Fei Li: Yeah well this is in the spirit of this conversation is that was back in 2015. There was starting to be a lot of excitement of AI, but there was also starting to be this talk about killer robot coming next door, Terminator is coming. At that time, Andrew, I was the director of Stanford AI Lab, and I was thinking, you know, we know how far we are from Terminators coming, and that seemed to be a really, a little bit of far-fetched concern, but I was living my work life with a real concern I felt no one was talking about, which was the lack of representation in AI.

Fei-Fei Li：是的，这次谈话的主题回到了 2015 年。当时人们对 AI 的兴奋开始增多，也开始有人讨论杀手机器人甚至终结者即将到来。那时，Andrew，我是斯坦福 AI 实验室的主任，我在想，我们知道距离终结者的到来还很遥远，这似乎是一个有些牵强的担忧。但在我的工作中，我真正担忧的是一个很少有人谈论的问题，那就是 AI 领域中的代表性不足。

At that time, I guess after Daphne has left, I was the only woman faculty at Stanford AI lab and we're having very small, around 15 percent of women graduate students, and we really don't see anybody from the underrepresented minority groups in Stanford AI underrepresented minority groups in Stanford AI program. And this is a national or even worldwide issue. So it wasn't just Stanford. Frankly, it still needs a lot of work today.

在那时，我猜 Daphne 离开后，我成为斯坦福 AI 实验室唯一的女性教员。当时，女性研究生的比例非常低，仅约占 15%，而且在斯坦福 AI 项目中，我们几乎看不到来自代表性不足的少数群体的身影。这不仅是斯坦福的问题，而是一个全国乃至全球的问题。坦率地说，直到今天，这方面仍然需要付出很多努力。

Exactly. So how do we do this? Well, I got together with my former student, Olga Rusarkovsky, and also a long-term educator of STEM topics, Dr. Rick Sommer, from Stanford pre-collegiate study program, and thought about inviting high schoolers, at that time, women, high school young women, to participate in a summer program to inspire them to learn AI. And that was how it started in 2015. In 2017, we got a lot of encouragement and support from people like Jensen and Lori Huang and Melinda Gates. And we formed the national nonprofit AI for All, which is really committed to training or helping tomorrow's leaders, shaping tomorrow's leaders for AI from students of all walks of life, especially the traditionally underserved and underrepresented communities. And you know till today we've had many many summer camps and summer programs across the country. More than 15 universities are involved. And we have online curriculum to encourage students, as well as college pathway programs to continue to support these students' career by matching them with internships and mentors. So it's a continued effort of encouraging students of all walks of life.

那么，我们是怎么做到的呢？我和我的前学生 Olga Rusarkovsky 以及斯坦福大学预科课程项目的长期 STEM 教育者 Dr. Rick Sommer 一起，决定邀请高中阶段的年轻女性参加一个夏季项目，以激发她们对 AI 的兴趣。这一切始于 2015 年。到 2017 年，我们得到了 Jensen 和 Lori Huang 以及 Melinda Gates 等人的大力支持，成立了一个名为 AI for All 的全国性非营利组织，专注于培养未来的 AI 领袖，尤其是来自传统上被忽视和代表性不足群体的学生。直到今天，我们在全国范围内开展了许多夏令营和夏季项目，超过 15 所大学参与其中。我们还提供在线课程，鼓励学生学习 AI，并设立大学路径项目，通过实习和导师配对支持学生的职业发展。这是一项持续的努力，旨在鼓励来自各行各业的学生。

Andrew Ng: And I remember back then, I think your group was printing these really cool T-shirts that asked the question, AI will change the world, who will change AI? And I thought the answer of making sure everyone can come in and participate, that was a great answer. Still an important question today. So that's a great thought and I think that takes us to the end of the interview. Any final thoughts for the people watching this?

Andrew Ng：我记得当时，你们团队制作了一些非常酷的 T 恤，上面写着这样的问题：AI 将改变世界，那谁又会改变 AI 呢？我觉得这个问题的答案 —— 确保每个人都能参与其中 —— 真的很棒。即便在今天，这依然是一个重要的问题。这是个很好的想法，我想我们也到了采访的尾声。对于观看这次采访的人，你还有什么要补充的吗？

Fei-Fei Li: This is a very nascent field. As you said, Andrew, we are still in the middle of this. I still feel there's just so many questions that I wake up excited to work on with my students in the lab. I think there's a lot more opportunities for the young people out there who want to learn and contribute and shape tomorrow's AI.

Fei-Fei Li：这是一个非常新的领域。正如你所说，Andrew，我们还在发展的过程中。我每天早上醒来都很兴奋，因为有很多问题等着和我的学生一起在实验室研究。我认为，想要学习、贡献并塑造未来 AI 的年轻人有很多机会。

Andrew Ng: Well said, Fei-Fei. That's very inspiring. Really great to chat with you and thank you for this video.

Andrew Ng：你说得很好，Fei-Fei。这真让人感到鼓舞。很高兴和你聊天，感谢你制作这个视频。

Fei-Fei Li: Thank you. It's fun to have these conversations.

Fei-Fei Li：谢谢。这些对话很有趣。

### 宝玉的翻译补充

宝玉 @dotey

今天给大家翻译的是最近吴恩达采访李飞飞的一期视频「Andrew Ng and Fei-Fei Li Discuss Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence - Stanford Online」，都是 AI 领域的重量级人物。李飞飞现在是斯坦福大学的计算机科学教授，还是 HAI（以人为本的人工智能研究所）的联席主任。李飞飞还是吴恩达邀请去的斯坦福，最开始还担心李飞飞不去，而李飞飞则说，谁能抵挡斯坦福的诱惑。

第一个话题是为什么李飞飞从物理专业转到了人工智能领域。

李飞飞分享了她的经历，她一直对物理和 STEM 充满热情，后来在普林斯顿大学主修物理并在神经科学实验室实习。然而，通过阅读了一些伟大物理学家的著作例如薛定谔的《生命是什么？》罗杰·彭罗斯的《皇帝的新脑》，她对智能产生了极大的好奇心，这促使她在研究生阶段转向了人工智能。

她对智能的基本计算原理有极大的兴趣，期待有一天能找到一组简单的原理或方程，可以定义智能的过程，无论是动物智能还是机器智能。

李飞飞认为 AI 还处于初级阶段，就像牛顿之前的物理学，曾经有过伟大的物理学，伟大的物理学家，很多现象学，很多关于天体如何运动的研究。但是是牛顿开始写出非常简单的定律。我们仍在经历那个非常令人兴奋的 AI 基础科学成长时期，就像当年的物理学还处于牛顿之前的阶段。

第二个话题是李飞飞早年的移民经历。

李飞飞在 15 岁时移民到美国，她的父母不会说英语，经营一家干洗店可能是她们家最好的选择，因为洗衣店主要是周末营业，这样她作为学生也可以参与运营。尽管生活充满挑战，李飞飞坚持下来，并成功进入普林斯顿大学。干洗店的经营帮助她接触到了机器，也使得她对 STEM（科学、技术、工程和数学）领域产生了兴趣。

吴恩达也分享了他的早年经历，他在高中时曾在办公室工作，经常复印文件，为人们泡咖啡。这些经历启发他思考如何用机器人完成这些工作，这可能也种下了他对 AI 的兴趣的种子。

希望他们高中的故事能够激励更多的人，无论我们起点如何，都有机会成功。

第三个话题是关于李飞飞如何开始 ImageNet 项目和创建的 Caltech 101 数据库的。

李飞飞是最早将机器学习应用于计算机视觉的学生之一，这在当时是一个具有争议的想法。在计算机视觉和人类智能理解的研究中，她利用机器学习方法进行真实世界对象的识别，尽管她很快就发现这个领域的一个主要挑战是模型的泛化能力不足。为了解决这个问题，李飞飞和她的导师开始探索大规模数据项目，创建了 Caltech 101 数据库。李飞飞开始做这事时非常早，那时候数码相机还非常昂贵，最初的数据是李飞飞和她妈还有几个本科生一起做的。

这个数据库对许多研究者产生了积极影响。之后，李飞飞进一步扩展了数据库，创建了更大的 ImageNet 数据库，尽管这个想法在最初的时候遭到了很多质疑。但最终，这个庞大的数据库为全球无数研究者解锁了大量价值。

由于最开始受到了很多质疑和困难，但最终项目还是取得了巨大的成功。就这个话题李飞飞分享了一点人生经验，就是设置北极星目标（即长期大目标）的重要性，并建议研究生们不应该只是为了发表论文而进行研究，而应该有一个长远的目标去驱动他们的工作。

吴恩达对这个观点也很赞同，他也提醒大家即使项目刚开始规模比较小，也可以作为实现更大目标的基础。

另外很重要的就是去追求自己真正感兴趣的研究领域，李飞飞会问她的学生：「是什么北极星在驱使你？」

这段对话很精彩，我直接原文转发一下：

「吴恩达：当我想起那个故事时，它看起来像是一个有时候人们觉得他们应该只从事项目的例子，而不是一开始就做大事。但我觉得对于从事机器学习的人来说，如果你的第一个项目是一个稍微小一点的，那完全没问题。祝你取得好成绩。利用所学知识为实现更大的目标打下基础，然后有时候你会得到像 ImageNet 那样的巨大成功。

李飞飞：但与此同时，我认为追求一个大胆的目标也很重要。你可以根据问题的规模或项目的规模设定局部里程碑，沿着这条道路前进，但我也关注我们现在的一些学生。他们受到如此大的同伴压力，在这个不断出版的气候中。这变得更多的是为了只是为了出版而进入一篇文章。我个人总是推动我的学生去问这个问题，是什么北极星在驱使你？

吴恩达：是的，这是真的。这些年来，当我做研究时，我总是充满激情地去做我感兴趣的事情，在那里，我想尝试推动观点向前发展。不必听别人的意见。要听别人的意见，让他们影响你的看法。但最后，我认为最好的研究者让世界影响他们的观点，但最后，还是要根据自己的观点来推动事物。

李飞飞：完全同意，是的。这是你自己内心的火焰。」

第四个话题是李飞飞如何将计算机视觉和神经科学应用到多个领域，尤其是医疗保健。

李飞飞认为她在计算机视觉领域的研究进化也遵循动物视觉智能的进化。有两个话题真正让她兴奋：

1、一个是什么是真正有影响力的应用领域，能够帮助改善人类生活？这就是医疗保健工作。

2、另一个是视觉在最终究竟是关于什么的？这让她试图在感知和机器人学习之间封闭回路。

李飞飞引用了一组数字：每年约有 25 万美国人死于医疗错误，这大大超过了因车祸导致的死亡人数，医院感染导致的死亡人数超过 95,000，这比车祸死亡人数多 2.5 倍。

李飞飞和她的合作伙伴阿尼·米尔斯坦博士开始了一个项目，名为环境智能研究议程，目的是在医院或养老院安装智能传感器，以提高病人的安全性。但她指出，应用 AI 时，除了机器学习问题，还需要处理诸如隐私等人类问题。

第五个话题是关于人工智能（AI）在公共政策中的重要性。

四年前，李飞飞和斯坦福大学的一些教职工意识到斯坦福需要在 AI 领域发挥更重要的角色，为此他们创建了人类中心 AI 研究所（HAI）。这个研究所旨在以人为本，研究下一代的人工智能教育、研究和政策。

李飞飞提到，AI 快速地影响着人们的生活，法律和政策必须要跟上。她认为专家需要和政策制定者更深入地交流，以利用 AI 更好地造福人民。这不仅涉及公平和隐私，还涉及到人才流向产业、数据和计算机的集中等问题。

李飞飞参与推动的一项政策工作就是《全国人工智能研究云任务组法案》（现为国家人工智能研究资源，NAIRR），这个法案要求成立一个任务小组，为美国公共部门和研究部门提供更好的获取 AI 计算和数据资源的途径，以重振美国在 AI 创新和研究方面的生态系统。这是一项更多的激励政策，旨在建设和振兴生态系统。

吴恩达问了李飞飞一个很有代表性的问题：「你对于刚开始学习机器学习的人有什么建议？」

李飞飞的建议是：

1、现在的 AI 和 ML 学习资源比以往任何时候都要丰富，从 Coursera 到 YouTube、TikTok 和 Github，使得全球范围内的学习者都能够获取到这些知识。

2、对非技术背景的人来说，AI 也提供了丰富的机会，无论是应用、创造力、政策、社会问题，还是经济、伦理、政治科学等方面。

3、人工智能可能带来的挑战和问题，如定义数字时代的经济，机器人和软件在工作流程中的影响，以及生成性 AI 对创造力和艺术创作者的影响等。

吴恩达也基于李飞飞的建议提出了自己的建议，他的建议是现在人工智能的技术很通用，无论你的个人兴趣是什么领域，都很容易可以将你的兴趣和 AI 结合起来。现在 AI 还是很新的领域，基于兴趣可以开创自己的道路，去做一些令人兴奋的工作。

最后一个话题是关于李飞飞开展的 AI4ALL 项目。

AI4ALL 项目旨在引导年轻的学生，特别是来自代表性不足的群体，接触并学习 AI。李飞飞在自己作为斯坦福人工智能实验室唯一的女性教师时，意识到了代表性不足的问题。

AI4ALL 最初被称为 SAILORS，这个项目于 2015 年开始，由李飞飞与她的学生宇川佐科夫斯基和教育专家瑞克·萨默一起启动。它最初是一个暑期项目，邀请年轻女性高中生学习 AI。在得到詹森·黄、洛瑞·黄和梅琳达·盖茨等人的支持后，该项目于 2017 年扩展为全国性的非营利组织，现已在全国超过 15 所大学开设夏令营和暑期项目，同时提供在线课程并通过实习和导师计划提供持续的支持。

最后引用 AI4ALL 的口号来结尾：「AI 将改变世界，谁将改变 AI？」，希望我们每个人都能参与其中！
