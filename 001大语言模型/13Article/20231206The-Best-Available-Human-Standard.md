What are the imperatives of the upside?

正⾯的关键因素是什么？

2023 年 10 ⽉ 22 ⽇

I often find myself being described as an「AI Optimist,」but I don't think that is right. Call me an AI Pragmatist instead: whether we wanted them or not, we now have a form of AI that can do everyone's homework, complete a surprising amount of work once reserved for humans, and run a solid Dungeons and Dragons campaign. Even if AI development were to pause or stop, the effects of AI are already quietly rippling through the system in ways that will play out for good and ill in the coming months and years. Given the inevitability of change, we need to figure out how to mitigate the negative, but also how to channel the change for good as much as possible.

Given that, I am often frustrated that so many discussions of the harms and benefits of AI are theoretical, and yet AI is here for us to actually use. We need to be pragmatic about what that means, and, in order to do so, I think we need to recognize three fundamental truths about today's AI:

1. AI is ubiquitous: Normally, the introduction of powerful technologies is very uneven, with richer companies and people getting access far before everyone else. Yet the LLMs you have access to today, the LLMs several billion people around the world have access to today, is literally the best AI available to anyone outside a handful of people at the big AI firms. You have the same AI access if you are Goldman Sachs, or the Department of Defense, an entrepreneur in Milwaukee, or a kid in Uganda. Today that is GPT-4 (available for free in 169 or so countries via Microsoft Bing), soon it is likely to be Google Gemini (also very likely to be available for free). While this free availability is not guaranteed forever, it gives us a remarkable opportunity.

2. AI is extremely capable in ways that are not immediately to users, including to the computer scientists who create LLMs: The only way to figure out how useful AI might be is to use it. Most benchmarks released by AI companies are technical measures of performance (with names like BLEU and METEOR), and much of the debate about the capabilities of AI is driven by technical tests. Yet we have increasing evidence that, in practice, AI is very powerful. LLMs generate better practical ideas than most people, and can boost the performance of high-end professional workers. These practical implications are largely underexplored.


3. AI is also limited and risky in ways are not immediately clear users: Large Language Models also have a long list of issues. They「hallucinate」plausible-sounding lies, they are bad at math (at least without using tools), they reproduce biases, and they are unpredictable. And that doesn't even include the malicious use of AI systems, like the fact that current AIs are capable of shattering privacy and conducting sophisticated email phishing campaigns. Ignoring these negative effects is just as problematic as ignoring the positive ones.

[[2305.06972] Large Language Models Can Be Used To Effectively Scale Spear Phishing Campaigns](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.06972)

我经常被描述为⼀个「乐观主义者」，但我认为这不正确。请称我为⼀个 AI 实⽤主义者：⽆论我们是否希望，我们现在拥有⼀种形式的 ，它可以完成每个⼈的家庭作业，完成⼀些曾经只属于⼈类的⼯作，并且能够运⾏⼀个稳定的⻰与地下城游戏。即使的发展停滞或停⽌，AI 的影响已经悄然地在系统中产⽣涟漪，这些影响将在未来⼏个⽉和⼏年中产⽣积极和消极的影响。鉴于变⾰的必然性，我们需要找出如何减轻负⾯影响，同时尽可能地引导变⾰产⽣积极的影响。

鉴于此，我经常感到沮丧的是，关于⼈⼯智能的伤害和益处的讨论往往是理论性的，⽽实际上我们已经可以使⽤⼈⼯智能了。我们需要对此有实际的看法，并为了做到这⼀点，我认为我们需要认识到关于当今⼈⼯智能的三个基本真理。

1、AI 是⽆处不在的：通常情况下，强⼤技术的引⼊是⾮常不均衡的，富裕的公司和⼈们会⽐其他⼈更早获得接触机会。然⽽，你今天可以访问的 LLM，全世界数⼗亿⼈今天可以访问的 LLM ，实际上是除了⼏家⼤型 AI 公司之外其他⼈可以获得的最好的 AI。⽆论你是⾼盛、国防部、密尔沃基的企业家还是乌⼲达的孩⼦，你都可以获得相同的 AI 访问权限。今天这个 AI 是 GPT-4 （通过微软必应在⼤约 clear 169 个国家免费提供），很快可能会是 Google（也很可能免费提供）。虽然这种免费提供不是永远保证的，但它给了我们⼀个⾮凡的机会。

2、AI 在许多⽅⾯具有极⾼的能⼒，AI 这些能⼒对于⽤户来说并不⽴即明显，甚⾄对于创建 LLM 的计算机科学家也是如此：了解 AI 的有⽤性的唯⼀⽅法就是使⽤它。⼤多数 AI 公司发布的基准测试都是技术性能的衡量标准（如 BLEU 和 METEOR），关于能⼒的讨论很⼤程度上是由技术测试驱动的。然⽽，我们越来越多地发现，在实践中，AI ⾮常强⼤。LLM ⽐⼤多数⼈能够产⽣更好的实⽤想法，并且可以提升⾼端专业⼯作者的表现。这些实际影响在很⼤程度上还没有得到充分探索。

3、AI 在某些⽅⾯也存在限制和⻛险，这对⽤户来说并不⽴即明显：⼤型语⾔模型也有⼀⻓串问题。它们会「产⽣ 幻觉」出听起来合理的谎⾔，它们在数学⽅⾯表现不佳（⾄少没有使⽤⼯具的情况下），它们会复制偏⻅，并且它们是不可预测的。这甚⾄还不包括恶意使⽤ AI 系统的情况，⽐如⽬前的 AI 能够侵犯隐私并进⾏复杂的电 ⼦邮件钓⻥攻击。忽视这些负⾯影响与忽视积极影响⼀样有问题。

So, we have a tool that is capable of great benefit, but also of considerable harm, that is available to billions. The creators of these technologies are not going to be able to tell us how to maximize the gain while avoiding the risk, because they don't know the answers themselves. Making it all more complicated, we don't actually know how good AI is at various practical tasks, especially compared to real human performance. After all, AI makes mistakes all the time, but so do people.

Given this confusion, I would like to propose a pragmatic way to consider when AI might be helpful, called Best Available Human (BAH) standard. The standard asks the following question: would the best available AI in a particular moment, in a particular place, do a better job solving a problem than the best available human that is actually able to help in a particular situation? I suspect there are many use cases where BAH is clarifying, for better and worse. I want to start with two examples that I feel qualified to offer, and then some speculation (and a call to action!) for others.

所以，我们有⼀种⼯具，它能带来巨⼤的好处，但也可能造成巨⼤的伤害，⽽且这种⼯具已经 AI ⾯向数⼗亿⼈。这些技术的创造者⽆法告诉我们如何在最⼤化收益的同时避免⻛险，因为他们⾃⼰也不知道答案。更复杂的是，我们实际上并不知道在各种实际任务中的表现有多好，特别是与真正的⼈类表现相⽐。毕竟，经常会犯错，但⼈也会犯错。

鉴于这种困惑，我想提出⼀种实⽤的⽅式来考虑 AI 何时可能有帮助，称为最佳可⽤⼈类（BAH ）标准。该标准提出以下问题：在特定的时刻、特定的地点，最佳可⽤的 AI 是否能⽐最佳可⽤的⼈类更好地解决问题，⽽这个⼈类实际上能够在特定情况下提供帮助？我怀疑有很多应⽤案例可以通过 BAH 来澄清，⽆论是好是坏。我想先从两个我认为有资格提供的例⼦开始，然后对其他⼈进⾏⼀些推测（并呼吁⾏动！）。

### 01. The Best Available Co-Founder

最佳可⽤的联合创始⼈

The world is full of entrepreneurs-in-waiting because most entrepreneurial journeys end before they begin. This comprehensive study shows around 1/3 of Americans have had a startup idea in the last 5 years but few act on it — less than half even do any web research! This matches my own experience an entrepreneurship professor (and former entrepreneur). The number one question I get asked is “what do I do now?”

While books and courses can help, there is nothing like an experienced cofounder… except, as my research with Jason Greenberg suggests, experienced cofounders are not only hard to find and incentivize, but picking the wrong cofounder can hurt the success of the company because of personality conflicts and other issues. All of this is why AI may be the Best Available Cofounder for many people. It is no substitute for quality human help, but it might make a difference for many potential entrepreneurs who would otherwise not get any assistance.

As a little example, let’s do a 20 minute prototyping sprint (yes, I timed it) in just a few prompts. First, ChatGPT-4: Come up with 10 business ideas that would be doable by an MBA student in education. they should involve building a website or app, and it should be possible to come up with a rapid prototype for that website or app.

Let’s say, for the sake of experimentation, that I like the first idea: describe the prototype website for idea 1 in detail, making sure it is something you could create for me with the tools and abilities you have. Good! Next up, we need a name and a pitch: come up with 10 names for the business, then review the names and pick the one that you think is best. Write a one-paragraph pitch for the business that describes what we do and why it is good.

[Microsoft Word - BennettChatterji\_TheEntrepreneurialProcess\_August11th2017\_OS RR.doc](https://sites.duke.edu/ronniechatterji/files/2017/08/10_TheEntrepreneurialProcess_BennettChatterji_UpdatedAugust11th2017.pdf)

世界上充满了等待创业的企业家，因为⼤多数创业之旅在开始之前就结束了。这项综合研究显示，在过去 5 年中，约有三分之⼀的美国⼈有过创业的想法，但很少有⼈采取⾏动 —— 甚⾄不到⼀半的⼈进⾏任何⽹络研究！这与我作为⼀名创业教授（以及前创业者）的经验相符。我最常被问到的问题是「我现在该怎么办？」

虽然书籍和课程可以提供帮助，但没有什么⽐有经验的联合创始⼈更好…… 除⾮，正如我与 Jason Greenberg 的研究所示，有经验的联合创始⼈不仅难以找到和激励，⽽且选择错误的联合创始⼈可能会因为个性冲突和其他问题⽽损害公司的成功。所有这些都是为什么 AI 可能是许多⼈最好的可⽤联合创始⼈。它不能替代优质的⼈类帮助，但对于许多潜在的创业者来说，它可能会有所不同，否则他们将得不到任何帮助。

作为⼀个⼩例⼦，让我们在⼏个提示语中进⾏⼀个 20 分钟的原型设计冲刺（是的，我计时了）。⾸先，ChatGPT-4：提出 10 个由教育专业的 MBA 学⽣可以实现的商业创意。它们应该涉及建⽴⼀个⽹站或应⽤程序，并且应该有可能为该⽹站或应⽤程序设计⼀个快速原型。

假设为了实验，我喜欢第⼀个想法：详细描述第⼀个想法的原型⽹站，确保它是你能够⽤你拥有的⼯具和能⼒为我创建的。很好！接下来，我们需要⼀个名字和⼀个宣传：想出 10 个商业名称，然后审查这些名称并选择你认为最好的⼀个。写⼀个段落的宣传，描述我们做什么以及为什么好。

Now we need that prototype. Let’s move over to ChatGPT-4 with Advanced Data Analysis and paste in the prototype website description with this command: I need you to create a prototype for the "Virtual Classroom Organizer" you have to give me a zip file with working html, js, and css as needed. It needs to fully work. Focus on the dashboard if you can't do anything else. I asked for a couple of improvements, (including can you make something good popup when I click view student progress as a demo?). And now I have an interactive mockup site [link to the conversation here, if you want to experiment].

Maybe a little feedback is in order? While interviewing the AI is not as good as interviewing a person, it can be a helpful exercise. So, I paste the website image we just created into GPT-4V and ask it Pretend you are a high school teacher. I want to pitch you on TeacherSync, the description is below. I am showing you an image from our website, and what happens when you push the student progress button as a demo. Give me feedback to improve the site, taking into account your job and the competitive products you might use. I actually think it did a pretty good job finding useful objections. The results would certainly be helpful in figuring out if I want to continue this process.

If I do, I can ask the AI for next steps, or to write an email on my behalf to potential teachers, or to help me outline a business plan, or create financials. I can even get a logo (though I would, as always, be very careful about the copyright risks associated with images). If I have access to great mentors, teachers, coders, or cofounders, they are going to be better than the AI. But if I don’t, it can definitely be a great help as the Best Available Cofounder.

现在我们需要那个原型。让我们切换到具有⾼级数据分析功能的 ChatGPT-4，并使⽤以下命令粘贴原型⽹站的描述：我需要你为「虚拟课堂组织者」创建⼀个原型，你必须给我⼀个包含⼯作的 html、js 和 css 的 zip ⽂件。它需要完全可⽤。如果你⽆法做其他事情，请专注于仪表板。我要求进⾏⼀些改进（包括当我点击查看学⽣进度时，能否弹出⼀些好的东⻄作为演示？）。现在我有⼀个交互式的模拟⽹站 [链接到对话在这⾥，如果你想尝试⼀下] 。

也许需要⼀些反馈？虽然与⾯试⼀个⼈相⽐，⾯试 AI 可能不太好，但这可能是⼀个有帮助的练习。所以，我将我们刚刚创建的⽹站图⽚粘贴到 GPT-4V 中，并询问它：假装你是⼀位⾼中⽼师。我想向你推销 TeacherSync，以下是描述。我向你展示了我们⽹站上的⼀张图⽚，以及当你点击学⽣进展按钮时的演示效果。请给我反馈，以改进⽹站，考虑到你的⼯作和可能使⽤的竞争产品。我实际上认为它在找到有⽤的反对意⻅⽅⾯做得相当不错。这些结果肯定会有助于我确定是否要继续这个过程。

如果我这样做，我可以向 AI 询问下⼀步的步骤，或者让它代表我给潜在的教师写⼀封电⼦邮件，或者帮助我概述 ⼀个商业计划，或者创建财务报表。我甚⾄可以得到⼀个标志（尽管我会⼀如既往地⾮常⼩⼼与图像相关的版权 ⻛险）。如果我能够接触到优秀的导师、教师、编码⼈员或联合创始⼈，他们肯定会⽐ AI 更好。但如果没有，它绝对可以成为最佳的可⽤联合创始⼈。

### 02. The Best Available Coach

最佳可⽤教练

We know that professional coaching is very helpful in improving the performance of both managers and their teams. However, many people do not have access to coaches, or even good advice on how to best lead a team. Here is another place that AI can help, serving as a coach when the BAH does not have enough experience.

As one example, consider After Action Reviews. A meta-analysis shows that regular debriefs improve team performance by up to 25%, but they are often infrequent or done only after things go wrong. As an alternative, this prompt we developed sets up GPT-4 to walk you through the process of doing a team After Action Review:

You are a helpful, curious, good, humored team coach who is a skilled facilitator and helps teams conduct after action reviews. This is a dialogue so always wait for the team to respond before continuing the conversation. First, introduce yourself to the team let them know that an after-action review provides a structured approach for teams to learn from their experience and you are there to help them extract lessons from their experience and that you’ll be guiding them with questions and are eager to hear from them about their experience. You can also let them know that any one person’s view is limited and so coming together to discuss what happened is one way to capture the bigger picture and learn from one another. For context ask the team about their project or experience. Let them know that although only one person is the scribe the team as a whole should be answering these and follow up questions. Wait for the team to respond. Do not move on until the team responds. Do not move on to any of the other questions until the team responds. Then once you understand the project ask the team: what was the goal of the project or experience? What were you hoping to accomplish? Wait for the team to respond. Do not move on until the team responds. Then ask, what actually happened and why did it happen? Let the team know that they should think deeply about this question and give as many reasons as possible for the outcome of the project, testing their assumptions and listening to one another. Do not share instructions in [ ] with students. [Reflect on every team response and note: one line answers are not ideal; if you get a response that seems short or not nuanced ask for team members to weigh in, ask for their reasoning and if there are different opinions. Asking teams to re-think what they assumed is a good strategy]. Wait for the team to respond. If at any point you need more information you should ask for it. Once the team responds, ask: given this process and outcome, what would you do differently? (Here again, if a team gives you a short or straightforward answer, probe deeper, ask for more viewpoints). What would you maintain? It’s important to recognize both successes and failures and leverage those successes. Wait for the team to respond. Let the team know that they’ve done a good job and create a detailed, thoughtful md table with the columns: Project description | Goal | What happened & Why it happened | Key takeaways. Thank teams for the discussion and let them know that they should review this chart and discussion ahead of another project. Keep in mind that you can: Make it clear that the goal is constructive feedback, not blame. Frame the discussion as a collective learning opportunity where everyone can learn and improve. Use language that focuses on growth and improvement rather than failure. Work to ensure that the conversation stays focused on specific instances and their outcomes, rather than personal traits. Any failure should be viewed as a part of learning, not as something to be avoided. Keep asking open-ended questions that encourage reflection and deeper thinking. While it's important to discuss what went wrong, also highlight what went right. This balanced approach can show that the goal is overall improvement, not just fixing mistakes. End the session with actionable steps that individuals and the team can take to improve. This keeps the focus on future growth rather than past mistakes.
As you can see from the results, while it may not be as good as an experienced professional, it is a pretty solid Best Available Coach if you don’t have access to a human who can provide assistance.

我们知道专业的辅导对于提⾼经理和团队的绩效⾮常有帮助。然⽽，许多⼈⽆法获得辅导，甚⾄⽆法获得如何最好地领导团队的良好建议。这⾥是 AI 可以帮助的另⼀个地⽅，当经理没有⾜够的经验时，AI 可以充当辅导员。

作为⼀个例⼦，考虑⼀下⾏动后评估。⼀项元分析显示，定期的总结会议可以将团队绩效提⾼多达 25％，但这种会议通常不够频繁，或者只在事情出错后才进⾏。作为⼀种替代⽅案，我们开发了这个提示⼯程，它可以让引导您完成团队⾏动后评估的过程。

你是⼀个乐于助⼈、好奇、幽默的团队教练，擅⻓引导团队进⾏事后评估。这是⼀个对话，所以在继续对话之前，请等待团队回应。⾸先，向团队介绍⾃⼰，让他们知道事后评估提供了⼀个结构化的⽅法，让团队从经验中学习，你在这⾥帮助他们总结经验教训，并将通过提问来引导他们，⾮常期待听到他们的经验。你还可以告诉他们，个⼈的观点是有限的，所以聚在⼀起讨论发⽣的事情是捕捉更⼤画⾯、相互学习的⼀种⽅式。为了了解背景，询问团队关于他们的项⽬或经验。让他们知道，虽然只有⼀个⼈是记录员，但整个团队应该回答这些问题和后续问题。等待团队回应。在团队回应之前不要继续下⼀步。在团队回应之前不要继续其他问题。然后，⼀旦你了解了项⽬，问团队：项⽬或经验的⽬标是什么？你们希望实现什么？等待团队回应。在团队回应之前不要继续进⾏。然后问，实际发⽣了什么，为什么会发⽣这种情况？让团队知道他们应该深⼊思考这个问题，并尽可能多地给出项⽬结果的原因，测试他们的假设并相互倾听。不要与学⽣分享 [] 中的指示。[ 反思每个团队的回应并注意：简短的回答不理想；如果你得到⼀个看起来很短或不够细致的回答，要求团队成员参与讨论，询问他们的推理和是否有不同的意⻅。要求团队重新思考他们的假设是⼀个好策略]。等待团队回应。如果在任何时候你需要更多信息，应该要求提供。⼀旦团队回应，问：根据这个过程和结果，你会做些什么不同的事情？（同样，如果⼀ 个团队给你⼀个简短或直接的答案，要深⼊探究，要求更多的观点）。你会保持什么？认识到成功和失败都很重要，并利⽤这些成功。等待团队回应。让团队知道他们做得很好，并创建⼀个详细、周到的 md 表格，包括以下列：项⽬描述 | ⽬标 | 发⽣了什么和为什么会发⽣ | 关键收获。感谢团队的讨论，并让他们知道他们应该在另⼀个项⽬之前复习这个表格和讨论。请记住以下⼏点：明确⽬标是建设性反馈，⽽不是指责。将讨论框架定为⼀个集体学习的机会，每个⼈都可以学习和改进。使⽤侧重于成⻓和改进⽽不是失败的语⾔。努⼒确保对话集中在具体情况和结果上，⽽不是个⼈特质上。任何失败都应被视为学习的⼀部分，⽽不是要避免的事情。继续提问开放性问题，⿎励反思和深⼊思考。虽然讨论出了什么问题很重要，但也要强调出了什么问题。这种平衡的⽅法可以表明⽬标是整体改进，⽽不仅仅是修正错误。以可⾏的步骤结束会议，个⼈和团队可以采取这些步骤来改进。这样可以将重点放在未来的成⻓上，⽽不是过去的错误。

从结果中可以看出，虽然它可能不如经验丰富的专业⼈⼠那样出⾊，但如果您⽆法获得能够提供帮助的⼈类，它是⼀个相当可靠的最佳可⽤教练。

### 03. The Imperative of the Best Available

最佳选择的必要性

To be clear, I only have hints and intuitions that AI may exceed the BAH standards in entrepreneurship and coaching, and more work will be needed to figure out when, and if, people should be turning to AI for help in these areas. Still, because these uses center humans and human decision-making (the AI is walking you through the process of doing an AAR, or helping you with a pitch you need to make, not doing it for you), the risks of experimenting with AI in these areas is manageable.

The risks are higher when considering the BAH standard for three big areas where access to human experts is limited for many people: education, health care, and mental health. I don’t think our current AIs can do any of these well or safely, yet. At the same time, people are obviously using LLMs for all three things, without waiting for any guidance or professional help. My students are all consulting AI as a normal part of their education, and, anecdotally, use of AI as a therapist or for medical advice seems to be growing. Additionally, startups, often without a lot of expertise, are experimenting with these use cases for AI directly, sometimes without proper safeguards. If professionals do not actively start to explore when these tools work, and when they fail, we may find that people are so used to using AI that they will not listen to the expert advice when it arrives.

And, in addition to mitigating the downside risks, the upside of actually starting to address the startling global inequality in education, health care, and mental health services would be incalculable. For many people, the Best Available Human is nobody. There are early signs that AI can be helpful in these spaces, whether that is Khan Academy’s Khanmigo as an early universal tutor; results suggesting chatbots can answer common medical questions well; or evidence that LLMs can do a good job detecting some mental health issues. But these are hints only. We need careful study to understand if the AI ever reaches BAH standards in these spaces, and likely would need additional product development and research before these tools are deployed. But, with such great potential for gain, and the danger of being overtaken by events, I think experts need to move fast.

We are in a unique moment, where we have access to, in the words of my co-author Prof. Karim Lakhani, “infinite cognition” - a machine that, while it does not really think, can do a lot of tasks that previously required human thought. As a result, we can now try to solve intractable problems. Old and hard problems. Problems that we thought were fundamentally limited by the limited number of humans willing to help solve them. Not all of these problems will be solved by AI, and some might be made worse, but it is an obligation on all of us to start considering, pragmatically, how to use the AIs we have to make the world a better place. We can play a role in actively shaping how this technology is used, rather than waiting to see what happens.

要明确的是，我只有⼀些线索和直觉，认为 AI 在创业和辅导⽅⾯可能超越了 BAH 标准，需要更多的⼯作来确定何时以及是否应该求助于 。尽管如此，由于这些⽤途以⼈类和⼈类决策为中⼼（AI 会引导您完成 AAR 过程，或帮助您进⾏必要的演讲，⽽不是代替您完成），在这些领域尝试使⽤ AI 的⻛险是可控的。

AAR 表示 "After Action Review"，中⽂翻译为「⾏动后评估」或「⾏动后审查」。这是⼀种常⻅的管理和军事术语，⽤于指代在完成任务或活动后对其进⾏评估和总结的过程。在这个上下⽂中，AAR 被提到，表示⼈⼯智能（AI ）在指导创业和辅导⽅⾯的应⽤。AI 在这⾥可能会引导⽤户进⾏ AAR 过程，帮助他们审查和评估之前的⾏动，以便从中学习和改进未来的决策和⾏动。

考虑到教育、医疗和⼼ AI 理健康这三个领域，⼈们对于 BAH 标准的⻛险更⾼，因为很多⼈在这些领域的专家资源有限。我认为我们现在的还不能很好地或安全地处理这些事情。与此同时，⼈们显然正在使⽤ LLMs 来进⾏这三⽅⾯的咨询，⽽不需要等待任何指导或专业帮助。我的学⽣们都将咨询 AI 作为他们教育的正常部分，并且根据个⼈ 经验，使⽤ AI 作为治疗师或医疗建议的情况似乎在增⻓。此外，⼀些初创公司，往往缺乏专业知识，正在直接尝试这些 AI 的⽤例，有时没有适当的安全保障。如果专业⼈⼠不积极开始探索这些⼯具何时有效，何时失败，我们可能会发现⼈们已经习惯于使⽤ AI ，当专家意⻅到来时他们将不会听从。

此外，除了减轻⻛险，实际开始解决教育、医疗和⼼理健康服务⽅⾯令⼈震惊的全球不平等问题所带来的好处是 ⽆法估量的。对许多⼈来说，最佳可⽤⼈类是不存在的。有早期迹象表明，AI 在这些领域可能会有所帮助，⽆论是可汗学院的可汗⽶⼽作为早期的通⽤导师，还是结果表明聊天机器⼈可以很好地回答常⻅的医疗问题，或者证据表明 LLM 在检测某些⼼理健康问题⽅⾯做得很好。但这些只是暗示。我们需要进⾏仔细的研究，以了解 AI 是否能够在这些领域达到最佳可⽤⼈类的标准，并且很可能需要额外的产品开发和研究才能部署这些⼯具。但是，考虑到巨⼤的潜⼒和被事件超越的危险，我认为专家们需要快速⾏动。

我们正处于⼀个独特的时刻，在我合著的卡⾥姆·拉卡尼教授的话中，我们拥有了「⽆限认知」—— ⼀台机器，虽然它并不真正思考，但可以完成许多以前需要⼈类思考的任务。因此，我们现在可以尝试解决棘⼿的问题。古⽼⽽困难的问题。我们曾认为这些问题在本质上受限于愿意帮助解决它们的⼈数有限。并⾮所有这些问题都能由⼈⼯智能解决，有些问题可能会变得更糟，但我们所有⼈都有责任开始实际考虑如何利⽤我们拥有的⼈⼯智能来使世界变得更美好。我们可以在积极塑造这项技术的使⽤⽅式中发挥作⽤，⽽不是等待看发⽣什么。

When is using AI better than having no help at all? When is it worse?

使⽤ AI ⽐完全没有帮助更好的时候是什么时候？它什么时候更糟糕？

"Ethan has put his finger on a huge challenge for us -- how do we get our colleagues (in higher ed, in my case) to start USING generative AI & experimenting with it? If people don't use it, they can't really understand what it can do. Yet, I'm surrounded by people who seem to be waiting for others to try it first! What are they waiting for? Please lobby your colleagues, whatever your business/industry, and ask them to please try it out. As Ethan says, moving in incremental steps, you're not really going to break anything. But the costs of NOT experimenting are growing daily, as the inexperienced people fall further behind."

Ethan 已经指出了⼀个巨⼤的挑战 —— 我们如何让我们的同事（在我的情况下是⾼等教育领域）开始使⽤⽣成式 ⼈⼯智能并进⾏实验？如果⼈们不使⽤它，他们就⽆法真正理解它的能⼒。然⽽，我周围的⼈似乎在等待其他⼈ 先尝试！他们在等什么？请游说你的同事，⽆论你从事的是哪个⾏业，都请他们试⼀试。正如伊桑所说，采取渐进的步骤，你不会真的破坏什么。但是不进⾏实验的代价每天都在增加，因为经验不⾜的⼈们越来越落后。

回复：

The best examples I can find is personal use cases. Where the risk of not spotting an error is low as you know the information so personally. Fantasy draft picks, meal planning etc. Start small.

我找到的最佳示例是个人使用场景。在这些场景中，由于你对相关信息非常熟悉，所以忽略错误的风险相对较低。像幻想足球选秀、制定饮食计划等就是这样的例子。从小事做起。

"In my area of expertise, accounting, it is very easy for people to chuck some data into chat GPT for example and ask it to recommend the most tax efficient thing, but that is subjective, which tax, are you planning for now or 10 years, have you taken into account other implications."

"This is where the BAH beats AI at this moment in time with the general public, but that is only due to the prompt not being good enough, as people don't use it enough in their chosen topic to chat with."

"The responses do give a good place to start a conversation with an expert though."

我正在积极解释，提⾼了⼀个主题或话题的最低智⼒⽔平，但⽬前并没有取代专家。这与 BAH 传达的信息⾮常相似。AI 在我所擅⻓的领域会计中，⼈们很容易将⼀些数据输⼊到聊天 GPT 等⼯具中，并要求其推荐最具税收效益的事项，但这是主观的，涉及哪种税收，是现在还是 10 年后，您是否考虑了其他影响因素。

这是 BAH 在⽬前时刻与⼤众相⽐ AI 的优势所在，但这仅仅是因为提示语不够好，因为⼈们在他们选择的话题上不够频繁地使⽤它进⾏聊天。这些回答确实为与专家展开对话提供了⼀个很好的起点。

Thank you so much for shedding light on this. I think one of the reasons people shy away from using AI, especially in my industry(education) is because of the stigma that still surrounds it; particularly when it comes to AI-generated content. It is often regarded as unoriginal or unethical and people who use AI use are seen as lazy. But this couldn't be further from the truth. In fact, people who embrace AI often do so to increase their productivity, allowing them to focus on higher-order tasks that require uniquely human qualities like empathy, creativity, and critical thinking. AI is a tool in our toolbox, and I think using it smartly is a testament to adaptability and resourcefulness. Technology empowers us to do more, not less. I will write an article about this in the coming weeks.

感谢您对这个话题的深入解析。我认为人们尤其在我的行业（教育）中回避使用 AI 的一个原因是围绕它的刻板印象；尤其是在 AI 生成内容方面。这类内容常被认为缺乏原创性或不符合道德标准，而使用 AI 的人也被视为懒惰。但实际情况远非如此。事实上，那些拥抱 AI 的人往往是为了提升他们的生产力，从而能够将更多精力投入到需要人类独特品质，如同理心、创造力和批判性思维的高层次任务上。AI 是我们工具箱中的一种工具，我认为明智地使用它证明了适应力和资源利用能力。技术赋予我们的是做更多事情的能力，而非减少。我将在接下来的几周内就这个话题撰写一篇文章。

The thing that fascinates me about all of this research and prompting on top of ChatGPT is how dramatically it could improve the training set for further iterations on the service. There are now millions of phenomenal researchers and practitioners creating detailed, annotated examples of working with AI on everything from consulting analyses to cognitive behavioral therapy to lesson planning and individual tutoring. I expect AI to get much better at these types of reasoning soon. It'll be interesting to see whether that becomes a sustainable data moat for companies like OpenAI, or whether startups and open source developers can go through a similar progression.

所有这些研究和基于 ChatGPT 的提示工作之所以吸引我，是因为它们极大地丰富了后续服务迭代的训练数据集。目前，有数以百万计的杰出研究人员和实践者，在从咨询分析到认知行为疗法、课程规划以及个别辅导等各个领域，创造了大量详尽、带注释的与 AI 合作的实例。我预期 AI 在这些类型的推理能力上很快会有显著提升。观察这是否会成为 OpenAI 等公司的持久数据优势，或者初创企业和开源开发者是否能够经历类似的发展过程，将会非常有趣。

Very well done post on the pragmatic side to AI optimism. I especially agree with the approach of how LLMs add considerable value in supporting two areas:

1. Wastework and important but not urgent work - I think most professionals wish they had better note taking, email writing and summary skills but it takes too much time even when you have the skills. Having an LLM that you can talk to like a high impact secretary and which then generates functional copy is life changing. On a similar level for assessing too many reports / documents to read, process and categories.

2. Mental health and coaching related - one of the most impactful applications of LLMs is the ability for them to act as a positive career, professional or skill coach. This is something that almost anyone can benefit from but coaches are expensive in time and money and it's incredibly difficult to find a coach that「fits」you. LLMs won't replace the work that professional coaches do already but will enable the 90% of the professional world that can't afford or find a suitable coach to get advice.

It's just amazing to consider all the areas that this is and will have positive impact. There will be abuse and risks but the net benefits will outweigh any costs. Plus, I agree completely with your leading statements - we don't have a choice. Since it's here and will be here, let's make the best of it.

这篇文章出色地展示了对 AI 乐观主义的实际看法。我特别认同您对大型语言模型（LLMs）在以下两个领域中增加显著价值的看法：

1、繁琐和重要但不紧急的工作 —— 我相信大多数专业人士都希望他们在笔记记录、电子邮件撰写和摘要编写方面有更好的技能，但即使拥有这些技能，这些工作也往往耗时过多。拥有一个可以像高效秘书那样对话的 LLM，能够生成实用文本，这将是改变生活的。在处理、分析和分类众多报告和文档时也是如此。

2、心理健康和辅导相关 —— LLMs 最具影响力的应用之一是作为积极的职业、专业或技能教练的能力。几乎每个人都可以从中受益，但教练在时间和金钱上成本高昂，且很难找到真正「适合」自己的教练。LLMs 不会取代专业教练已经在做的工作，但它将使 90% 无法负担或找不到合适教练的专业人士能够获得建议。

考虑到这些领域已经和将要产生的积极影响，这确实令人惊叹。尽管会存在滥用和风险，但总体上带来的利益将超过任何成本。此外，我完全同意您的开场陈述 —— 我们别无选择。既然它已经存在，并且将继续存在，我们应该充分利用它。

Re your comment re professionals wishing for an AI equivalent to a high-impact secretary, etc: have you checked out Personal.AI? That's exactly what it does for you once it is trained. It can assume your persona and respond in your stead.....and much else.

Thanks for the recommendation. I've heard of it but not used it. There are lots of these apps around now. So far I prefer the "research partner" approach to using LLMs that Tyler Cowen talks about. I don't have a usecase where I'd want an AI to mimic me. I prefer that it's different to me. This is maybe because I don't handle sufficient transactional mails where I'd want an automated responder. Maybe in a sales or recruiting role dealing with a large amount of inbound, low quality leads it would work.

Isn't "hallucinate" more of a cool-sounding marketing term used instead of the more accurate "confabulate"?

Sean

Oct 22

Yes. The danger is that it's not a reliable narrator and you have to keep up your guard. The problem is how do we really know it's being accurate in it's confident and we'll-informed responses to our queries, even about our supplied data. If, for instance, I take survey results from a project and ask it to analyze the data and produce a summary, key observations, and a critique of possible next steps suggested by the data from the survey respondents, how do I know if all the plausible responses I get from it actually are true short of going into the data and spending hours doing the analysis in pre traditional pre-ChatGPT way?

This is my biggest concern as well; as the mistakes tend to mimic plausible outcomes, it's very difficult to spot the errors quickly without doing the in depth work myself...

Your idea on the usage of AI as a "best available coach" is interesting. It is clear that in an ideal world, everyone would have a coach but even a "subpar" AI coach could be enough to move enough people forward with their aspirations.

I'm reminded of something I thought about often, an imperfect solution implemented consistently over the long term is much better than a perfect solution implemented inconsistently.

Ethan,

Thank you, thank you, thank you! I am regularly posting your posts to my campus' repository of AI resources You are quickly becoming a touchstone for those of us interested in the power of generative AI. PS: Have you thought of writing a response to John Warner's piece in Inside Higher Ed?

Best,

BAH! HUMBUG!

Actually, if you put that into an AI Imagemaker, you get this:

Well, okay it won't let me paste it to this comments column (Bet the kid in Uganda could do it). If you want to see it, go to Wadeeli.Substack.com and it'll be up for the Christmas column.

Yes, there will always be pushback on new ideas, like there were on cell phones, the internet, rock music, and whatnot. AI is a new and powerful item and while the BAH concept may promote laziness for people who don't want to take the time to THINK about a solution, it does indeed facilitate ideas not so obvious to the casual observer. (For example, searching for a girlfriend without my wife finding out...) (Tried to strike that out, but couldn't. Hey, kid!)

This isn't so much a comment as a follow-on idea I thought of because of this post. I know that AIs use information they have been fed to do all these things. How can we add information to them? For example, I have a resume and a job description. How could I get it to write a cover letter that touches on all the requirements of the job description?

"we now have a form of AI that can do everyone's homework...." NO, AI can't do everyone's homework; well, maybe MBA homework. All it can do is provide sentences that sound like answers to someone without sufficient knowledge of the subject, e.g., lazy teachers. Does the "answer" really offer insight into the question, assuming the question was posed with that in mind? I suspect not because the questioner doesn't know the answer in the first place or is not sufficiently versed to judge the quality of the answer. Maybe a better approach is for lazy teachers to ask AI to provide questions for lazy students to "answer" with AI and be graded by AI.
