you can download for free at: http://www.objectdcl.com/download.html

## 1.2 Launching the ObjectDCL Editor

An ObjectDCL shortcut was created during the installation routine. Use this shortcut to launch the ObjectDCL Editor program. You should see a Toolbar below the Windows menu and four dockable windows arranged two on the left , two on the right side of the screen and one on the bottom. The View menu has check marks visible that control the visibility of these windows. Double clicking on the bar at the top of each window toggles between a minimal window and docked window. These windows can also be dragged into the central workspace and resized. Clicking on them again will return them to their previous docked position. These windows can be located wherever you desire.

The ObjectDCL Editor is an integrated development environment for designing dialogs, forms, panes and dockable windows for CAD LISP.

Developers have a visual interactive way to design forms quickly and efficiently. It is not necessary to deal with DCL language anymore. The API exposed to LISP is simple to use. It allows complete control on forms. It also provides a number of events to receive notifications on how the end-user interacts with the dialogs.

Developers can make their automation scripts for CAD become user friendly in no time. This in turn leads to greater adoption of their applications and therefore to larger customer productivity gains and better sales.

The ObjectDCL technology is designed to meet the needs of technical drafters, automation scripts developers, consultants and software manufacturers. The technology has a distributable portion that can be deployed easily and reliably on technical drafter workstations. Scripts and ObjectDCL dialogs can be created for internal use or for commercial software.
