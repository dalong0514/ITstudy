## JupyterNotebook

1、Jupyter Notebook 中自动加载。

To import this module into a Jupyter Notebook we simply write the following. IPython has a handy magic extension known as autoreload. If you add the following code before the import then if you make any changes to the module file they will automatically be reflected in the notebook.

```py
%load_ext autoreload
%autoreload 2

import preprocessing as pr
```
