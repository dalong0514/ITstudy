I've used:and the text wraps in Chrome but not Firefox.Update: I decided to change the design so it didn't need the wrap; trying to sort out a CSS fix/hack was proving too frustrating and time consuming.Try this, I think this will work for something like "AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAARRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGG"

will produceI have taken my example from a couple different websites on Google.  I have tested this on ff 5.0, IE 8.0, and Chrome 10.Use CSS3 word-wrap: break-word;. Works in WebKit based browsers (Safari, Chrome) as well.Update: I forgot, the element in question must however be either implicitly or explicitly positioned as fixed element or displayed as block element. For table cells (td), use display: inline-block;.For an automatic table layout try to style the concerned td combining the attributes max-width and word-wrap. Eg: <td style="max-width:175px; word-wrap:break-word;"> ... </td>Tested in Firefox 32, Chrome 37 and  IE11. Here is advanced version of what OP asked.Sometimes, what happens is that, our client wants us to give '-' after word break to end of line.Like break to So, there is new CSS property if supported, usually supported in latest browsers.I am using this one. I hope somebody will have demand like this.You can manually inject zero width spaces (&#8203;) to create break points.Set a column width for the td tag.One slightly hackish way of doing this is by processing the text to add space between each letter. Replace spaces with &nbsp; Then use the letter-spacing css attribute to bring the spaces down.I know, it's a hack... but if NOTHING else works, it should wrap without problem. I think this is a long standing issue in Firefox, that harks back to Mozilla and Netscape.  I'll bet you were having the issue with the display of long URLs.  I think it is an issue with the rendering engine rather than something you can fix with CSS, without some ugly hacks.Makes sense to change the design.This looked hopeful though: http://hacks.mozilla.org/2009/06/word-wrap/I'm using Angular for my project, and managed to solve this with a simple filter:Template:Filter:You can't see it, but after $1 there is an invisible space (thanks @kingjeffrey for the tip), which enabled word breaks for table cells.

All I want is to be able to change the color of a bullet in a list to a light gray. It defaults to black, and I can't figure out how to change it.I know I could just use an image; I'd rather not do that if I can help it.The bullet gets its color from the text.  So if you want to have a different color bullet than text in your list you'll have to add some markup.Wrap the list text in a span:Then modify your style rules slightly:I managed this without adding markup, but instead using li:before. This obviously has all the limitations of :before (no old IE support), but it seems to work with IE8, Firefox and Chrome after some very limited testing. It's working in our controller environment, wondering if anyone could check this. The bullet style is also limited by what's in unicode.This was impossible in 2008, but it's becoming possible soon (hopefully)!According to The W3C CSS3 specification, you can have full control over any number, glyph, or other symbol generated before a list item with the ::marker pseudo-element.

To apply this to the most voted answer's solution:JSFiddle ExampleNote, though, that as of July 2016, this solution is only a part of the W3C Working Draft and does not work in any major browsers, yet.If you want this feature, do these:the big problem with this method is the extra markup. (the span tag)Hello maybe this answer is late but is the correct one to achieve this.Ok the fact is that you must specify an internal tag to make the LIst text be on the usual black (or what ever you want to get it). But is also true that you can REDEFINE any TAGS and internal tags with CSS. So the best way to do this use a SHORTER tag for the redefinitionUsign this CSS definition:And this html code:You get required result. Also you can make each disc diferent color:Just do a bullet in a graphics program and use list-style-image:Wrap the text within the list item with a span (or some other element) and apply the bullet color to the list item and the text color to the span.As per W3C spec, But the idea with a span inside the list above should work fine!You can use Jquery if you have lots of pages and don't need to go and edit the markup your self.here is a simple example:For a 2008 question, I thought I might add a more recent and up-to-date answer on how you could go about changing the colour of bullets in a list.If you are willing to use external libraries, Font Awesome gives you scalable vector icons, and when combined with Bootstrap's helper classes (eg. text-success), you can make some pretty cool and customisable lists.I have expanded on the extract from the Font Awesome list examples page below:Font Awesome (mostly) supports IE8, and only supports IE7 if you use the older version 3.2.1.It works as well if we set color for each elements for example:

I added some Margin to left now.You could use CSS to attain this.  By specifying the list in the color and style of your choice, you can then also specify the text as a different color.Follow the example at http://www.echoecho.com/csslists.htm.Just use CSS:You'll want to set a "list-style" via CSS, and give it a color: value.

I would like to use dynamic text as background of certain elements in my tag. Because of this, I can use images (dynamic text). How do I do it with just CSS or JavaScript?You can have an absolutely positioned element inside of your relative positioned element:And then the CSS:Here's an example of it.SVG text background imageHere is an indented version of the CSS so you can understand better. Note that this does not work, you need to use the single liner SVG from the snippet above instead:Not sure how portable this is (works on Firefox 31 and Chrome 36), and it is technically an image... but the source is inline and plain text, and it scales infinitely.@senectus found that it works better on IE if you base64 encode it: https://stackoverflow.com/a/25593531/895245It may be possible (but very hackish) with only CSS using the :before or :after pseudo elements:This seems to work, but you'll probably need to tweak it a little. Also note it won't work in IE6 because it doesn't support :after.Ciro's solution about an SVG Data URI background containing the text is very clever.However, it won't work in IE if you just add the plain SVG source to the data URI.In order to get around this and make it work in IE9 and up, encode the SVG to base64. This is a great tool.So this:Becomes this:Tested and it works in IE9-10-11, WebKit (Chrome 37, Opera 23) and Gecko (Firefox 31).http://jsfiddle.net/qapp5dLn/@CiroYou can break the inline svg code with back-slash "\"Tested with the code below in Chrome 54 and Firefox 50I even Tested this, and it works (at least in Chrome 54 & Firefox 50 ==> usage in NWjs & Electron guarenteed)(But use this in rare occasions, because HTML method is PREFERRED WAY).You could make the element containing the bg text have a lower stacking order ( z-index, position ) and possibly even set opacity. So the element you need on top would need a higher stacking order ( z-index:5; position:relative; for ex ) and the element behind would need something lower ( default or just a lower z-index like 3 and position:relative; ).

This asumes all infowindows are the same size!Short answer: set the maxWidth options property in the constructor. Yes, even if setting the maximum width was not what you wanted to do.Longer story:

Migrating a v2 map to v3, I saw exactly the problem described. Windows varied in width and height, and some had vertical scrollbars and some didn't. Some had <br /> embedded in the data, but at least one with that sized OK.I didn't think the InfoWindowsOptions.maxWidth property was relevant, since I didn't care to constrain the width... but by setting it with the InfoWindow constructor, I got what I wanted, and the windows now autosize (vertically) and show the full content without a vertical scrollbar. Doesn't make a lot of sense to me, but it works!See: http://fortboise.org/maps/sailing-spots.htmlYou should give the content to InfoWindow from jQuery object.it works for meEDITED (to standout): Trust me, out of the hundred other answers to this question, this is the only correct one that also explains WHY it's happeningOk, so I know this thread is old, and has a thousand answers, but none of them is correct and I feel the need to post the correct answer. Firstly, you do not ever need to specify width's or height's on anything in order to get your infoWindow to display without scrollbars, although sometimes you may accidentally get it working by doing this (but it's will eventually fail).Second, Google Maps API infoWindow's do not have a scrolling bug, it's just very difficult to find the correct information on how they work. Well, here it is:When you tell the Google Maps API to open in infoWindow like this:For all intents and purposes, google maps temporarily places a div at the end of your page (actually it creates a detached DOM tree - but it's conceptually easier to understand if I say you imagine a div being places at the end of your page) with the HTML content that you specified. It then measures that div (which means that, in this example, whatever CSS rules in my document apply to h1 and p tags will be applied to it) to get it's width and height. Google then takes that div, assigns the measurements to it that it got when it was appended to your page, and places it on the map at the location you specified.Here's where the problem happens for a lot of people - they may have HTML that looks like this:and, for whatever reason, CSS that looks like this:Can you see the problem? When the API tries to take the measurements for your infoWindow (immediately before displaying it), the h1 part of the content will have a size of 18px (because the temporary "measuring div" is appended to the body), but when the API actually places the infoWindow on the map, the #map-canvas h1 selector will take precedence causing the font size to be much different than what it was when the API measured the size of the infoWindow and in this circumstance you will always get scrollbars.There may be more slightly different nuances for the specific reason why you have scrollbars in your infoWindow, but the reason behind it is because of this:So what I always do, is something like this:and in my CSS:So no matter where the API appends it's measurement div - before the closing body or inside a #map-canvas, the CSS rules applied to it will always be the same.EDIT RE: Font FamiliesGoogle seems to be actively working on the font loading issue (described below) and functionality has changed very recently so you may or may not see the Roboto font load when your infoWindow opens the first time, depending on the version of the API you are using. There is an open bug report (even though in the changelog this bug report was already marked as fixed) that illustrates that google is still having difficulty with this problem. ONE MORE THING: WATCH YOUR FONT FAMILIES!!!In the latest incarnation of the API, google tried to be clever and wrap it's infoWindow content in something that could be targeted with a CSS selector - .gm-style-iw. For people that didn't understand the rules that I explained above, this didn't really help, and in some cases made it even worse. Scrollbars would almost always appear the first time an infoWindow was opened, but if you opened any infoWindow again, even with the exact same content the scrollbars would be gone. Seriously, if you weren't confused before this would make you lose your mind. Here's what was happening:If you look at the styles that google loads on the page when it's API loads, you'll be able to see this:Ok, so Google wanted to make it's maps a bit more consistent by always making them use the Roboto font-family. The problem is, for the majority of people, the before you opened an infoWindow, the browser hadn't yet downloaded the Roboto font (because nothing else on your page used it so the browser is smart enough to know that it doesn't need to download this font). Downloading this font isn't instantaneous, even though it is very fast. The first time you open an infoWindow and the API appends the div with your infoWindow content to the body to take it's measurements, it starts downloading the Roboto font, but your infoWindow's measurements are taken and the window is placed on the map before Roboto finishes downloading. The result, quite often, was an infoWindow whose measurements were taken when it's content was rendered using Arial or a sans-serif font, but when it was displayed on the map (and Roboto had finished downloading) it's content was being displayed in a font that was a different size - and voila - scrollbars appear the first time you open the infoWindow. Open the exact same infoWindow a second time - at which point the Roboto has been downloaded and will be used when the API is taking it's measurements of infoWindow content and you won't see any scrollbars.I tried each one of the answers listed.  None worked for me.

This finally fixed it PERMANENTLY.

The code I inherited had a DIV wrapper around all the <h#> and <p> entries.  I simply forced some "style" in the same DIV, taking into account a desired max width, threw in the line height change just in case (someone else's fix) and my own white-space: nowrap, which then made the auto overflow make the correct adjustments.  No scroll bar, no truncation and no problems!I know this is an old thread, but I just encountered the same problem.  I had <h2> and <p> elements in the InfoWindow, and these both had bottom margins.  I removed the margins, and InfoWindow sized correctly.  None of the other suggested fixes worked.  I suspect that the InfoWindow size calculation doesn't take the margins into account.Going to add my answer to the list, since NONE of these fixed my problem. I ended up wrapping my content in a div, giving that div a class, and specifying the min-width on the div, AND specifying the maxWidth on the infoWindow, AND they both needed to be the same size, otherwise either the width or the height would be overflowing on boxes with just the wrong amount of content.Javascript:CSS:I have tried all of these solutions and none worked.  After some trial and error I figured it out.Set line-height:normal for the map canvas div.It appears that the issue is with the Roboto webfont. The infowindow is rendered with inline width and height properties based on the content provided. However, it is not calculated with the webfont already rendered/loaded. Once the font is rendered AFTER the entire map is printed to the screen, then it causes the scrollbars to appear due to the "overflow:auto" properties inline inside the window's DIVs.The solution I found to work is to wrap the content in a DIV and then apply CSS to override the webfont:Funny enough, while the following code will correct the WIDTH scroll bar:It took this to correct the HEIGHT scroll bar:EDIT:

Adding white-space: nowrap; to either style might correct the spacing issue that seems to linger when the scroll bars are removed. Great point Nathan.This works for me.

Put a div in the setContentThen add this CSS to your page:For example, see http://www.student-homes-northampton.co.uk; click the links under the house pics to display the Google map.This solved my problem completely:I was having the same problem with IE and tried many of the fixes detailed in these responses, but was unable to remove the vertical scrollbars in IE reliably.  What worked best for me was to switch to fixed font sizes inside the infowindow -- 'px'... I was using ems.  By fixing the font size I no longer needed to explicitly declare the infowindow width or height and the scrollbars were gone for good.  Also important is height of the map container. If to small infoWindow always will be on 80px height. Otherwise maxWidth and #innerDiv fix works like a charm.If nothing else, try adding the content after the window has been opened.  This should force it to resize.Use the domready event and reopen the info window and show the hidden content after the domready event fires twice to ensure all of the dom elements have been loaded. I tried just doing a setTimeout(/* show infowin callback */, 100), but sometimes that didn't work still if the content (ie: images) took too long to load.Hope this works for you.I was having the same issue, particularly noticeable when my <h2> element wrapped to a second line.I applied a class to a <div> in the infoWindow, and changed the fonts to a generic system font (in my case, Helvetica) versus an @font-face web font which it had been using. Issue solved.Add a min-height to your infoWindow class element.That will resolve the issue if your infoWindows are all the same size.If not, add this line of jQuery to your click function for the infoWindow:I couldnt get it to work in any way shape or form, I was including 3 divs into the box. I wrapped them in an outer div, with widths and heights all set correctly, and nothing worked.In the end I fixed it by setting the div as absolute top left, and then before the div, I set two images, one 300px wide and 1px high, one 120px high and 1px wide, of a transparent gif.It scaled properly then!Its ugly but it works.You could also do one image and set a zindex I expect, or even just one image if your window has no interaction, but this was containing a form, so, that wasn't an option...I think that this behavior is because of some css styling in an outer container, I had the same problem but I solved it using an inner div an adding some padding to it, I know it's weird but it solved the problemAnd in my style.cssI had an inline element (an a tag) directly inside of the div with style="overflow:auto"[... wrapped that in a p tag and fixed it.Looks like any inline element that is not nested in a block element directly inside of the infowindow will cause this.My answer is to add a listener (using addListenerOnce) to check if the infoWindow has been added to the DOM, then opening the infoWindow again (no need to close it).Adding the following to my CSS did the trick for me:Just to summarize all the solutions that worked for me in all browsers:I have tested it and it worked on every browser, and I had over 400 markers...I know that lots of other people have found solutions that worked for their particular case, but since none of them worked for my particular case, I thought this might be helpful to someone else.Some details:I'm using google maps API v3 on a project where inline CSS is something we really, really want to avoid. My infowindows were working for everything except for IE11, where the width was not calculated correctly. This resulted in div overflows, which triggered scrollbars.I had to do three things:I don't know why these worked, and I'm not sure if a subset of them would work. I know that none of them work for all of my use cases individually, and that 2 + 3 doesn't work. I didn't have time to test 1 + 2 or 1 + 3.It wasn't acceptable for me to hard code the width and height of the info window, or to set white-space: nowrap, the maxWidth solution didn't help me and everything else either didn't work or was otherwise inappropriate for my use case.My solution was to set the content, open the window and then when the domready event is fired, set the height CSS property on the content to whatever the height is, and then force Google Maps to resize the InfoWindow accordingly.infoWindow is the InfoWindow object, $infoWindowContents is a Jquery object of the contents I want to put in there, map is my Map object. marker is a marker which was clicked.(I posted the same solution over on a similar question How do I get a google-maps InfoWindow to resize to fit the content that is placed inside of it?)After losing time and reading for a while, I just wanted something simple, this css worked for my requirements.Also is not an instant solution but starring/commenting on the issue might make them fix it, as they believe it is fixed:

http://code.google.com/p/gmaps-api-issues/issues/detail?id=5713Well this is the one that did the trick for me:Only setting overflow: visible on .gm-style-iw actually made the problem worse! I noticed in the Chrome developer tools inspector that there are two divs inside the .gm-style-iw element, both which have overflow: auto set by default. I'm displaying quite a lot of HTML-formatted text in my InfoWindows, that might be why the other solutions didn't work at all for me.

what does -webkit-transform: translate3d(0,0,0);  exactly do?

Does it have any performance issues? Should I just apply it to the body or individual elements? It seems to improve scroll events drastically. Thanks for the lesson!-webkit-transform: translate3d(0,0,0); makes some devices run their hardware acceleration.A good read is found HereUsing -webkit-transform: translate3d(0,0,0); will kick the GPU into action for the CSS transitions, making them smoother (higher FPS).Note: translate3d(0,0,0) does nothing in terms of what you see. it moves the object by 0px in x, y and z axis. It's only a technique to force the hardware acceleration.An alternative is -webkit-transform: translateZ(0). And If there's flickering on Chrome and Safari due to transforms, try -webkit-backface-visibility: hidden and -webkit-perspective: 1000. For more info refer to this article.I didn't see an answer here that explains this. Lots of transformations can be done by calculating each of the div and its options using a complicated set of validation. However, if you use a 3D function, each of the 2D elements you have are considered as 3D elements and we can perform a matrix transformation on these elements on the fly. However, most of the the elements are "technically" already hardware accelerated because they all use the GPU. But, the 3D transforms work directly on the cached versions of each of these 2D renders (or cached versions of the div) and directly use a matrix transformation on them (which are vectorized and parallelized FP math).It is important to note that 3D transforms ONLY makes changes to features on a cached 2D div (in other words, the div is already a rendered image). So, things like changing the border width and color are no longer "3D" to be vaguely speaking. If you think about it, changing the border widths require you to rerender the div because and recache it so that the 3D transforms can be applied.Hope this makes sense and let me know if you have any more questions.To answer your quesetion, translate3d: 0x 0y 0z would do nothing since the transforms work directly on the texture that is formed by running the vertices of the div into the GPU shader. This shader resource is now cached and a matrix will be applied when drawing onto the frame buffer. So, basically there is no benefit from doing that.This is how the browser works internally.Step 1: Parse InputStep 2: Develop Composite LayerStep 3: Render Composite LayerThere's a bug with scrolling in MobileSafary (iOS 5) which leads to appearing artifacts as copies of input elements in the scrolling container.Using translate3d for each child element can fix that odd bug.

Here's an example of CSS which saved the day for me.Translate3D forces hardware acceleration.CSS animations, transforms and transitions are not automatically GPU accelerated, and instead execute from the browser’s slower software rendering engine.In order to use GPU we use translate3dCurrently, browsers like Chrome, FireFox, Safari, IE9+ and the latest version of Opera all come with hardware acceleration, they only use it when they have an indication that a DOM element would benefit from it. Be aware that it creates a stacking context  (plus what the other answers said), so it does potentially have an effect on what you see, e.g. making something appear over an overlay when it isn't supposed to.

In the typographic dimension of design, the height of letters has important spatial relationships to the rest of the elements. The lines in the source image above are intended to help point out the x-height of the text, but they also show where guidelines would be if designing around that text.As Jonathan pointed out in the comments, ex is simply the height version of em (width).To answer the question, one use is with superscript and subscript.

padding-top: 2 ex;Thus using a vertical unit of measure for a vertically scaling property and a horizontal unit of measure for a horizontally scaling property.The value of having it in the CSS spec, if that's what you're really asking, is exactly the same as the value of having the em unit.It enables you to set fonts to relative sizes.You don't know what my base font size is. So one good strategy for web design is to set font sizes which are relative, rather than absolute; the equivalent of "double your normal size" or "a little smaller than your normal size" rather than a fixed size like "ten pixels".Note that, terms like "single/double line spacing" actually mean the offset between two adjacent lines, measured by em. So "double line spacing" means each line has a height of 2 em.Therefore, if you want to specify a vertical distance that is proportional to "lines", use em. Only use ex if you want the actual height of lowercase letter, which is, I dare say, a much rarer instance.

The CSS approach isThe JavaScript approach isWhat are the advantages and disadvantages of each approach?  Does the CSS approach work well with most web browsers?  Is JavaScript slower than css? The problem with :hover is that IE6 only supports it on links.  I use jQuery for this kind of thing these days:Makes things a lot easier.  That'll work in IE6, FF, Chrome and Safari.The CSS one is much more maintainable and readable.Why not both?  Use jQuery for animated effects and CSS as the fallback. This gives you the benefits of jQuery with graceful degradation.CSS:jQuery (uses jQueryUI to animate color):demoOne additional benefit to doing it in javascript is you can add / remove the hover effect at different points in time - e.g. hover over table rows changes color, click disables the hover effect and starts edit in place mode.EDIT: This answer no longer holds true. CSS is well supportedand Javascript (read: JScript) is now pretty much required for any web experience, and few folks disable javascript.The original answer, as my opinion in 2009.Off the top of my head: With CSS, you may have issues with browser support. With JScript, people can disable jscript (thats what I do).I believe the preferred method is to do content in HTML, Layout with CSS, and anything dynamic in JScript. So in this instance, you would probably want to take the CSS approach.There is another difference to keep in mind between the two. With CSS, the :hover state is always deactivated when the mouse moves off an element. However, with JavaScript, the onmouseout event is not fired when the mouse moves off the element onto browser chrome rather than onto the rest of the page.This happens more often than you might think, especially when you're making a navbar at the top of your page with custom hover states.A very big difference is that ":hover" state is automatically deactivated when the mouse moves out of the element. As a result any styles that are applied on hover are automatically reversed.

On the other hand, with the javascript approach, you would have to define both "onmouseover" and "onmouseout" events. If you only define "onmouseover" the styles that are applied "onmouseover" will persist even after you mouse out unless you have explicitly defined "onmouseout".In Internet Explorer, there must be declared a <!DOCTYPE> for the :hover selector to work on other elements than the <a> element.Use CSS, it makes for much easier management of the style itself.In reguards to using jQuery to do hover, I always use the plugin HoverIntent as it doesn't fire the event until you pause over an element for brief period of time... this stops firing off lots of mouse over events if you accidentally run the mouse over them or simply whilst choosing an option.If you don't need 100% support for IE6 with javascript disabled you could use something like ie7-js with IE conditional comments. Then you just use css rules to apply hover effects. I don't know exactly how it works but it uses javascript to make a lot of css rules work that don't normally in IE7 and 8.

See MDN docs@xec's answer has more of a slide-in effect on the dots, while this allows the dots to appear instantly.You could try to use the animation-delay property and time each ellipsis character. In this case I've put each ellipsis character in a <span class> so I can animate them separately. I made a demo, which isn't perfect, but it shows at least what I mean :)The code from my example:HTMLCSSEven a more simple solution, works pretty well!Just edited the content with animation instead of hiding some dots...Demo here: https://jsfiddle.net/f6vhway2/1/Edit:

Thanks to @BradCollins for pointing out that content is not an animatable property.https://www.w3.org/TR/css3-transitions/#animatable-cssSo this is a WebKit/Blink/Electron only solution. (But it works in current FF versions as well)Short answer is "not really". However, you can play around with animating width and overflow hidden, and maybe get an effect that is "close enough". (code below tailored for firefox only, add vendor prefixes as needed).htmlcssdemo: http://jsfiddle.net/MDzsR/1/editIt appears chrome has issues with animating the pseudo-element. An easy fix is to wrap the ellipsis in its own element. Check out http://jsfiddle.net/MDzsR/4/A late addition but I found a way to do this which supports centered text.Well Actually there is a pure CSS way of doing this. I got the example from CSS Tricks, but made it also to be supported in Internet Explorer (I have tested it in 10+).Check the Demo: http://jsfiddle.net/Roobyx/AT6v6/2/HTML:CSS:Here is my solution with pure css https://jsfiddle.net/pduc6jx5/1/

Difference between static and relative positioning

[Difference between static and relative positioning](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5011211/difference-between-static-and-relative-positioning)

In CSS, what is the difference between static (default) positioning and relative positioning?

2011-02-16 00:35:10Z

In CSS, what is the difference between static (default) positioning and relative positioning?Static positioning is the default positioning model for elements. They are displayed in the page where they rendered as part of normal HTML flow. Statically positioned elements don't obey left, top, right and bottom rules:Relative positioning allows you to specify a specific offset (left, top etc) which is relative to the element's normal position in HTML flow. So if I have a textbox inside a div I could apply relative positioning on the textbox to have it display at specific place relative to where it would normally be placed within the div:There is also absolute positioning - whereby you specify the exact location of the element relative to the entire document, or the next relatively positioned element further up the element tree: And when a position: relative is applied to a parent element in the hierarchy:Note how our absolutely-position element is bound by the relatively-positioned element.And lastly there is fixed. Fixed positioning restricts an element to a specific position in the viewport, which stays in place during scroll:You may also observe the behaviour that fixed-positioned elements do not cause scroll because they are not considered to be bound by the viewport:Whereas absolutely-positioned elements are still bound by the viewport and will cause scrolling:..unless of course your parent element uses overflow: ? to determine the behaviour of the scroll (if any).With absolute positioning and fixed positioning, the elements are taken out of HTML flow.You can see a simple overview here: W3SchoolAlso, if I recall correctly, when declaring an element relative, it will by default stay in the same place as it otherwise should, but you gain the ability to absolutely position elements inside it relatively to this element, which I've found very useful in the past.In answer to "why CSS would still implement position: static;" in one scenerio, using position:relative for a parent and position:absolute for the child limits the scaling width of the child. In a horizontal menu system, where you could have 'columns' of links, using 'width:auto' does not work with relative parents. In this case, changing it to 'static' will allow the width to be variable dependent on the content within.I spent a good few hours wondering why I couldn't get my container to adjust based on the amount of content within it. Hope this helps!Position relative lets you use top/bottom/left/right for positioning. Static won't let you do this unless you use margin parameters. There's a difference between Top and margin-top.You won't need to use static much as it's defaultRelative position is relative to the normal flow. The relative position of that element (with offsets) is relative to the position where that element would have been normally if not moved.Matthew Abbott has a really good answer. Absolute and relative positioned items obey top, left, right and bottom commands (offsets) where static positioned items do not. Relatively positioned items move offsets from where they would normally be in the html. Absolute positioned items move offsets from the document or the next relatively positioned element up the DOM tree.Static :  A STATIC positioned element is what are we get by DEFAULT (Normal positioning of objects).Relative :  Relative to it’s current position, but can be moved.

Or A RELATIVE positioned element is positioned relative to ITSELF.static and relative are position attributes.relative is used for many uses. Not for one.

But keep in mind that static and relative don't harm to normal document flow of the Html.

static is the default position that when you write any element to Html.

 If an element has a relative position, that element can be positioned relative to its native place. when you want to adjust element from small spaces, use the relative position so that you don't need to add the margin, padding e.t.c

   if the element has a position relative and it has a child element. Here we can do measurements relatively to its parent. If you add width 10% to the child, that means (width+padding)x10%.but you don't add the relative keyword, you get widthx10%.

      Other than that, the most important usage of the relative is;

you can position any element top of it.but you have to use "absolute" keyword to child.when adding absolute keyword to the child, the child is out of the normal document flow

But as you can see from that link (they're doing 3 columns, 2 fixed but it's easy to alter), it's a problem long solved =)I did a quick experiment as well after looking at a number of potential solutions all over the place. What I was trying to do was to have a mix of fluid and fixed rows and columns.This is what I ended up with:http://jsbin.com/hapelawakeIf you prefer to avoid floats and clearfixes, use flex layout.Note: Add flex vendor prefixes if required by your supported browsers.You need to create an algorithm using jQuery or JS which checks for the remaining space and sets the width of the "remainder" element dynamically, per a responsive build.  If the build is not responsive, you can test and set the element width by doing simple mathematical calculations.We have experienced similar issues whilst building a liquid-responsive-grid based media system.

I made this example for people who use JQuery for other stuff on their pages and consider using it for this part also.

All the icons are found within a sprite image (also available as individual images) and they are added to the elements as positioned backround-images:Actual font icons (FontAwesome, for instance) do involve downloading a specific font and make use of the content property, for instance:As the content property isn't supported in older browsers, these also make use of images.Here's an example of completely raw FontAwesome in use as a font, turning &#xf0f9; ( - you may not be able to see this!) into an ambulance: http://jsfiddle.net/GWqcF/2If your question is how a CSS class can insert a specific character (that will be rendered as an icon in the special font), take a look at the source for FontAwesome:So a CSS content directive is used to insert the character (which is from a special private-use reserved area of Unicode that does not mess up other readers).How webfont icons work?Web-fonts icons work by using CSS to inject a specific glyph into the HTML using the content property. It then uses @font-face to load a dingbat webfont that styles the injected glyph. The upshot is that that injected glyph becomes the desired icon.To begin, you’ll need a web-font file with the icons you need, either defined for particular ASCII characters (A, B, C, !, @, #, etc.) or in the Private Use Area of the Unicode font, which are spaces in the font that will not be used by specific characters in a Unicode encoded font.Read more, how to create webfont icon at Responsive Webfont Icons.

[100% width background image with an 'auto' height](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11099930/100-width-background-image-with-an-auto-height)

I'm currently working on a mobile landing page for a company. It's a really basic layout but below the header there's an image of a product which will always be 100% width (the design shows it always going from edge to edge). Depending on the width of the screen the height of the image will obviously adjust accordingly. I originally did this with an img (with a CSS width of 100%) and it worked great but I've realised that I'd like to use media queries to serve different images based on different resolutions - let's say a small, medium and a large version of the same image, for example. I know you can't change the img src with CSS so I figured I should be using a CSS background for the image as opposed to an img tag in the HTML.I can't seem to get this working properly as the div with the background image needs both a width and a height to show the background. I can obviously use 'width: 100%' but what do I use for the height? I can put a random fixed height like 150px and then I can see the top 150px of the image but this isn't the solution as there isn't a fixed height. I had a play and found that once there is a height (tested with 150px) I can use 'background-size: 100%' to fit the image in the div correctly. I can use the more recent CSS3 for this project as it's aimed solely at mobile.I've added a rough example below. Please excuse the inline styles but I wanted to give a basic example to try and make my question a little clearer.Do I maybe have to give the container div a percentage height based on the whole page or am I looking at this completely wrong?Also, do you think CSS backgrounds are the best way to do this? Maybe there's a technique which serves different img tags based on device/screen width. The general idea is that the landing page template will be used numerous times with different product images so I need to make sure I develop this the best way possible.I apologise is this is a little long-winded but I'm back and forth from this project to the next so I'd like to get this little thing done. Thanks in advance for your time, it's much appreciated.

RegardsInstead of using background-image you can use img directly and to get the image to spread all the width of the viewport try using max-width:100%; and please remember don't apply any padding or margin to your main container div as they will increase the total width of the container. Using this rule you can have a image width equal to the width of the browser and the height will also change according to the aspect ratio.

If you want to have a 100% width, variable height background image done with CSS, instead of using cover (which will allow the image to extend out from the sides) or contain (which does not allow the image to extend out at all), just set the CSS like so:This will set your background image to 100% width and allow the height to overflow. Now you can use media queries to swap out that image instead of relying on JavaScript.EDIT: I just realized (3 months later) that you probably don't want the image to overflow; you seem to want the container element to resize based on it's background-image (to preserve it's aspect ratio), which is not possible with CSS as far as I know.Hopefully soon you'll be able to use the new srcset attribute on the img element. If you want to use img elements now, the currently accepted answer is probably best.However, you can create a responsive background-image element with a constant aspect ratio using purely CSS. To do this, you set the height to 0 and set the padding-bottom to a percentage of the element's own width, like so:In order to use different aspect ratios, divide the height of the original image by it's own width, and multiply by 100 to get the percentage value. This works because padding percentage is always calculated based on width, even if it's vertical padding.Try this Simplified versionYou can use the CSS property background-size and set it to cover or contain, depending your preference. Cover will cover the window entirely, while contain will make one side fit the window thus not covering the entire page (unless the aspect ratio of the screen is equal to the image).Please note that this is a CSS3 property. In older browsers, this property is ignored. Alternatively, you can use javascript to change the CSS settings depending on the window size, but this isn't preferred.Just use a two color background image:Add the css:And html is:CSS: stretching background image to 100% width and height of screen?It's 2017, and now you can use object-fit which has decent support. It works in the same way as a div's background-size but on the element itself, and on any element including images.

You can also play with the position of the background image (*nod to Tom Wright) with "background-position" or doing a completely definition of "background" (link to w3).Very simple method:Works in all modern browsers and IE8+.EditDon't use this on large sites though. The :before pseudo-element is horrible in terms of performance.Try something like: This works great For adding background icon always before text when length of text is not known in advance.

Does anyone know how to resize the HTML5 video poster such that it fits the exact dimensions of the video itself?here's a jsfiddle which shows the problem: http://jsfiddle.net/zPacg/7/here's that code:HTML:CSS:Notice that the orange rectangle doesn't scale to the red border of the video.Also, just adding the CSS below doesn't work either as it rescales the video along with the poster:

You can use a transparent poster image in combination with a CSS background image to achieve this (example); however, to have a background stretched to the height and the width of a video, you'll have to use an absolutely positioned <img> tag (example).It is also possible to set background-size to 100% 100% in browsers that support background-size (example).

A better way to do this would be to use the object-fit CSS property as @Lars Ericsson suggests.Useif you don't want to display those parts of the image that don't fit the video's aspect ratio, andto stretch the image to fit your video's aspect ratioExampleDepending on what browsers you're targeting, you could go for the object-fit property to solve this:or maybe fill is what you're looking for. Still under consideration for IE. Or you can use simply preload="none" attribute to make VIDEO background visible. And you can use background-size: cover; here.I was playing around with this and tried all solutions, eventually the solution I went with was a suggestion from Google Chrome's Inspector. If you add this to your CSS it worked for me:My solution combines user2428118 and Veiko Jääger's answers, allowing for preloading but without requiring a separate transparent image. We use a base64 encoded 1px transparent image instead.I came up with this idea and it works perfectly. Okay so basically we want to get rid of the videos first frame from the display and then resize the poster to the videos actual size. If we then set the dimensions we have completed one of these tasks. Then only one remains. So now, the only way I know to get rid of the first frame is to actually define a poster. However we are going to give the video a faked one, one that doesn't exist. This will result in a blank display with the background transparent. I.e. our parent div's background will be visible.Simple to use, however it might not work with all web browsers if you want to resize the dimension of the background of the div to the dimension of the video since my code is using "background-size".HTML/HTML5:CSS:CoverFill

I had a similar issue and just fixed it by creating an image with the same aspect ratio as my video (16:9).  My width is set to 100% on the video tag and now the image (320 x 180) fits perfectly.  Hope that helps!You can resize image size after generating thumbYou can use poster to show image instead of video on mobile device(or devices which doesn't support the video autoplay functionality). Because mobile devices not support video autoplay functionality.Now you can just style the poster attribute which is inside the video tag for mobile device via media-query.This workedAnd the CSS

However you can override this with the word-wrap CSS directive.You would need to set a width on the overall table then a width on the columns. "width:100%;" should also be OK depending on your requirements.Using word-wrap may not be what you want however it is useful for showing all of the data without deforming the layout.Make the table rock solid BEFORE the css. Figure your width of the table, then use a 'controlling' row whereby each td has an explicit width, all of which add up to the width in the table tag.Having to do hundreds html emails to work everywhere, using the correct HTML first, then styling w/css will work around many issues in all IE's, webkit's and mozillas.so:Will keep a table at 300px wide. Watch images that are larger than the width by extremesYou can add a div to the td, then style that.  It should work as you expected.Then the css.You can also work with "overflow: hidden" or "overflow-x: hidden" (for just the width). This requires a defined width (and/or height?) and maybe a "display: block" as well. "Overflow:Hidden" hides the whole content, which does not fit into the defined box.Example:http://jsfiddle.net/NAJvp/HTML:CSS:EDIT: Shame on me, I've seen, you already use "overflow". I guess it doesn't work, because you don't set "display: block" to your element ...I would try setting it to max-width:50px;You can also use percentages, and/or specify in the column headers:The bonus with percentages is lower code maintenance: you can change your table width without having to re-specify the column widths.Caveat:  It is my understanding that table width specified in pixels isn't supported in HTML 5; you need to use CSS instead.This works for me

Refresh your page - boom, your media query has now kicked in!  Hats off to Firefox for being awesome for web developing! Heads up, not only will the website now be boosted to twice the size, the Firefox UI will also be doubled. This doubling or zooming is necessary, as that's the only way you'll be able to examine all the pixels on a standard pixel ratio screen.This works fine on Windows 7 with Firefox 21.0, and also on Mac OS X with Firefox 27.0.1.If you're not using media queries and other more advanced logic (i.e. you're feeding everyone the HiDPI images), you can just zoom in with your browser to 200%. The Chrome emulation is a helpful tool as well as it kicks in media queries, but because it prevents zooming, you can't examine image quality.Zooming on Firefox & EdgeCurrently on Firefox and Edge, if you zoom it triggers dppx-based media queries. So this easier approach may be sufficient, but be aware that the functionality is reported as a "won't fix" bug for Firefox, so this could change.In Google Chrome version "33.0.1720.0 Canary", you can now emulate devices like iPhone5 and others with a great set of parameters like "Device pixel ratio", "android font metrics" and "Viewport emulation".There's no need for that Firefox hack anymore - hard to work with, anyway.Thanks Google dev team!  !:) In chrome you can do it by:1) Open up Chrome Developer Tools and click on the little "gear" icon.

2) Then choose "Show 'Emulation' view in console drawer."

3) Finally, open up the "console drawer" in Developer Tools, and choose Emulation.

Experience tells me that these two lines always improve performances, especially on iPad but also on Chrome.I did test on your exemple and, as far as I can tell, it works.As for the "why" part of your question... I don't know. 3D transform are a young standard, so implementation is choppy. That's why it's a prefixed property : for beta testing. Someone could fill a bug report or a question and have the team investigate.Edit per August 19th 2013:There's regular activity on this answer, and I just lost an hour finding that IE10 also need this.

So don't forget :The reason animation was slower when you added the null transform hack (translateZ(0)) is that each null 3D transform creates a new layer. When there are too many of these layers, rendering performance suffers because the browser needs to send a lot of textures to the GPU.The problem was noticed in 2013 on Apple's homepage, which abused the null transform hack. See http://wesleyhales.com/blog/2013/10/26/Jank-Busting-Apples-Home-Page/The OP also correctly noticed the explanation in their comment: Interesting. I've tried playing with a few options in about:flags, specifically these ones:Enabled those, tried it and failed miserably with the tickbox enabled (just like you did). But then I noticed yet another option:Given the highlight in the flag description, I'd speculate that hardware acceleration was, in fact, on for me even without the ticked checkbox since I saw the FPS counter with the options above turned on!TL;DR: hardware acceleration is, in the end, a user preference; forcing it with dummy translateZ(0) will introduce redundant processing overhead giving the appearance of lower performance.Check chrome://flags in chrome. It says My expericence is that GPUs aren't generally faster for all kind of graphics. For very "basic" graphics they can be slower.You might have gotten different result if you were rotating an image - that's the kind of thing GPUs are good atAlso consider that translateZ(0) is an operation in 3 dimensions, while changing top or left is a 2 dimensional operationI saw you two demo，I think I know the reason you confused：Above, only a personal opinion, thank you!

If you want to find out more specific information about each rule, check out the CSSRule object documentation.EDIT: This answer is now deprecated and no longer works in Chrome 64+. Leaving for historical context. In fact that bug report links back to this question for alternative solutions to using this.Seems I managed to answer my own question after another hour of research.It's as simple as this:(Works in WebKit/Chrome, possibly others too)Have a look at this library, which does what was asked for:  http://www.brothercake.com/site/resources/scripts/cssutilities/It works in all modern browsers right back to IE6, can give you rule and property collections like Firebug (in fact it's more accurate than Firebug), and can also calculate the relative or absolute specificity of any rule. The only caveat is that, although it understands static media types, it doesn't understand media-queries.Challenger appears.Line /* 1 */ builds a flat array of all rules.

Line /* 2 */ discards non-matching rules.Based on function css(el) by @S.B. on the same page.Maybe I will address these shortcomings one day.Here’s a much more comprehensive implementation taken from someone’s GitHub page

(forked from this original code, via Bugzilla). Written for Gecko and IE, but is rumoured to work also with Blink.4 May 2017: The specificity calculator has had critical bugs which I have now fixed. (I can’t notify the authors because I don’t have a GitHub account.)12 August 2018: Recent Chrome updates seem to have decoupled object scope (this) from methods assigned to independent variables. Therefore invocation matcher(selector) has stopped working. Replacing it by matcher.call(el, selector) has solved it.Here's a version of S.B.'s answer which also returns matching rules within matching media queries. I've removed the *.rules || *.cssRules coalescence and the .matches implementation finder; add a polyfill or add those lines back in if you need them.This version also returns the CSSStyleRule objects rather than the rule text. I think this is a little more useful, since the specifics of the rules can be more easily probed programmatically this way.Coffee:JS:Here is my version of getMatchedCSSRules function which support @media query.I think the answer from S.B. should be the accepted one at this point but it is not exact. It is mentioned a few times that there will be some rules that may be missed. Faced with that, I decided to use document.querySelectorAll instead of element.matches. The only thing is that you would need some kind of unique identification of elements to compare it to the one you are looking for. In most cases I think that is achievable by setting its id to have a unique value. That's how you can identify the matched element being yours. If you can think of a general way to match the result of document.querySelectorAll to the element you are looking for that would essentially be a complete polyfill of getMatchedCSSRules. I checked the performance for document.querySelectorAll since it probably is slower than element.matches but in most cases it should not be a problem. I see that it takes about 0.001 milliseconds. I also found CSSUtilities library that advertises that it can do this but I feel its old and has not been updated in a while. Looking at its source code, it makes me think there may be cases that it misses.Ensuring IE9+, I wrote a function which calculates CSS for requested element and its children, and gives possibility to save it to a new className if needed in snippet below.Usage

But I don't want to refresh the page, because I have some animations.So is there anything which I can use that my site updates automatically after a CSS update?

Maybe with JavaScript, jQuery, Ajax or something?Here you are: http://cssrefresh.frebsite.nl/CSSrefresh is a small, unobstructive javascript file that monitors the CSS-files included in your webpage. As soon as you save a CSS-file, the changes are directly implemented, without having to refresh your browser.Just insert the javascript file and it works!But note: It only works when you have the files on a server! If you develop with Sublime Text and Google Chrome or Apple Safari, then you should use Emmet LiveStyle. This is a more powerful Live CSS-Reloader.

Now I use it instead of CSS Refresh. If you want more information about this awesome plugin, please read the Post by Smashing MagazineWith jQuery you can create a function that reloads external stylesheets.Have a look at http://livereload.com/.It works as a browser plugin for OS X and windows. I like it because I do not have to embed additional javascript which I could accidentally commit in my versioning control.I find browser plugins/extensions to be the easiest solution. They don't require any code changes to your individual sites. And they can be used for any site on the web — which is useful if I modify something in-memory real quick to hide a toolbar or fix a bug temporarily; once finished mucking with it, I can press a key and all the CSS is back to normal.Once installed, (most) CSS reloaded plugins/extensions don't reload the CSS automatically. But usually work with something as simple as a toolbar button, a context menu item, and/or a simple key press to reload the CSS. I find this method is less error prone anyway, and is much less complicated then some of the automated solutions out there.Some examples (feel free to suggest some others):Chrome:Firefox:Here is my little Project. Please give it a try

It currently only works for CSS editing, but HTML editing is coming soon!Firebug for Firefox is my prefered method:

https://addons.mozilla.org/de/firefox/addon/firebug/

You can edit HTML and CSS on the fly, quickly deactivate CSS rules (without deleting them), add or remove HTML and so on. If you wan't to tweak your design this is your choice. You can even save changes to a local copy, but I hardly ever use that feature.If you are using Firefox then you can install Web Developer Toolbar 1.2.2 from Add-on of Firefox which has option of Reload Linked Stylesheets.Try using CSS Brush, a chrome plugin for creating CSS live. You needn't have to write all CSS in a text editor, come back to browser and reload it, rather write the CSS live as if you were doing it in a text editor.

[Rendering HTML in a WebView with custom CSS](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4950729/rendering-html-in-a-webview-with-custom-css)

My app is using JSoup to download the HTML of a message board page (let's say in this case it is a page containing the posts of a given thread). I'd like to take this HTML, strip out unwanted items, and apply custom CSS to style it to be 'mobile' in a WebView.Should I inject the styles into the HTML as I process it (since I will be processing it anyway) or is there a good way to add a CSS file to my app's assets and simply refer to it.

In col-xx-#, # is the number of columns you cover and offset is the number of columns you leave. For xx, in a general website, md is preferred and if you want your layout to look the same in a mobile device, xs is preferred.With what I can make of your requirement,Should do the trick.Alternate Bootstrap 4 solution (this way you can use divs which are smaller than col-6):MoreTo align two divs horizontally you just have to combine two classes of Bootstrap:

Here's how:This does the trick.The response provided by Ranveer (second answer above) absolutely does NOT work. He says to use col-xx-offset-#, but that is not how offsets are used. If you wasted your time trying to use col-xx-offset-#, as I did based on his answer, the solution is to use offset-xx-#.Alternative which I did programming Angular: I recommend css grid over bootstrap if what you really want, is to have more structured data, e.g. a side by side table with multiple rows, because you don't have to add class name for every child:css-grid

And that you're disabling the default rendering of the button by using:If so..Personally, I've found that you can't actually stop/override/disable this IE native action, which led me to change my markup a little to allow for this movement and not affect the overall look of the button for the various states.This is my final mark-up:I think this provides a more thorough approach:Your question says "Internet Explorer," but for those interested in other browsers, you can now use all: unset on buttons to unstyle them.It doesn't work in IE or Edge 18, but it's well-supported everywhere else.https://caniuse.com/#feat=css-allAccessibility warning: For the sake of users who aren't using a mouse pointer, be sure to re-add some :focus styling, e.g. button:focus { outline: orange auto 5px } for keyboard accessibility.Try removing the border from your button:In bootstrap 4 is easiest.

I was struggling with setting up libsass as it wasn't as straight-forward as the Ruby based transpiler. Could someone explain how to:I have little experience with package managers and even less so with task runners.I picked node-sass implementer for libsass because it is based on node.js.This will hopefully install all you need, if not read libsass at the bottom.General format:Examples:More usefull options like 'compression' @ here. Command line is good for a quick solution, however, you can use task runners like Grunt.js or Gulp.js to automate the build process.You can also add the above examples to npm scripts. To properly use npm scripts as an alternative to gulp read this comprehensive article @ css-tricks.com especially read about grouping tasks.A basic example to transpileAdd this code to your gulpfile.js:$ gulp sass runs the above task which compiles .scss file(s) in the sass folder and generates .css file(s) in the css folder.To make life easier, let's add a watch so we don't have to compile it manually. Add this code to your gulpfile.js:All is set now! Just run the watch task:As the name of node-sass implies, you can write your own node.js scripts for transpiling. If you are curious, check out node-sass project page.Libsass is a library that needs to be built by an implementer such as sassC or in our case node-sass. Node-sass contains a built version of libsass which it uses by default. If the build file doesn't work on your machine, it tries to build libsass for your machine. This process requires Python 2.7.x (3.x doesn't work as of today). In addition:The installation of these tools may vary on different OS.Under Windows, node-sass currently supports VS2015 by default, if you only have VS2013 in your box and meet any error while running the command, you can define the version of VS by adding: --msvs_version=2013. This is noted on the node-sass npm page.So, the safe command line that works on Windows with VS2013 is:

Can I replace the maxlength attribute with something in CSS?

2009-09-01 15:15:45Z

Can I replace the maxlength attribute with something in CSS?No. This needs to be done in the HTML. You could set the value with Javascript if you need to though.No.maxlength is for behavior.CSS is for styling.That is why.You can use jQuery like: Here is a demo: http://jsfiddle.net/TmsXG/13/I don't think you can, and CSS is supposed to describe how the page looks not what it does, so even if you could, it's not really how you should be using it.Perhaps you should think about using JQuery to apply common functionality to your form components?Not with CSS, no.Not with CSS, but you can emulate and extend / customize the desired behavior with JavaScript.As others have answered, there is no current way to add maxlength directly to a CSS class.However, this creative solution can achieve what you are looking for. I have the jQuery in a file named maxLengths.js which I reference in site (site.master for ASP)run the snippet to see it in action, works well.jquery, css, html:The advantage of using this: if it is decided the max length for this type of field needs to be pushed out or in across your entire application you can change it in one spot. Comes in handy for field lengths for things like customer codes, full name fields, email fields, any field common across your application.Use $("input").attr("maxlength", 4)

if you're using jQuery version < 1.6

and $("input").prop("maxLength", 4) 

if you are using jQuery version 1.6+.

Inline <style> tags vs. inline css properties

[Inline <style> tags vs. inline css properties](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/12013532/inline-style-tags-vs-inline-css-properties)

What is the preferred method for setting CSS properties?Inline style properties:Style properties in <style>...</style> tags:Style rules can be attached using:Generally, I prefer to use linked style sheets because they:However, your question is asking specifically about the style tag versus inline styles. Prefer to use the style tag, in this case, because it:Inline elements only affect their respective element.An important difference between the style tag and the inline attribute is specificity.  Specificity determines when one style overrides another. Generally, inline styles have a higher specificity. Read CSS: Specificity Wars for an entertaining look at this subject.I hope that helps!Here's one aspect that could rule the difference:If you change an element's style in JavaScript, you are affecting the inline style. If there's already a style there, you overwrite it permanently. But, if the style were defined in an external sheet or in a <style> tag, then setting the inline one to "" restores the style from that source.It depends.The main point is to avoid repeated code.If the same code need to be re-used 2 times or more, and should be in sync when change, use external style sheet.If you only use it once, I think inline is ok.To answer your direct question: neither of these is the preferred method. Use a separate file.Inline styles should only be used as a last resort, or set by Javascript code. Inline styles have the highest level of specificity, so override your actual stylesheets. This can make them hard to control (you should avoid !important as well for the same reason).An embedded <style> block is not recommended, because you lose the browser's ability to cache the stylesheet across multiple pages on your site.So in short, wherever possible, you should put your styles into a separate CSS file.From a maintainability standpoint, it's much simpler to manage one item in one file, than it is to manage multiple items in possibly multiple files.  Separating your styling will help make your life much easier, especially when job duties are distributed amongst different individuals.  Reusability and portability will save you plenty of time down the road.When using an inline style, that will override any external properties that are set.I agree with the majority view that external stylesheets are the prefered method.However, here are some practical exceptions:Whenever is possible is preferable to use class .myclass{} and identifier #myclass{}, so use a dedicated css file or tag <style></style> within an html.

Inline style is good to change css option dynamically with javascript.There can be different reasons for choosing one way over the other.Otherwise, as stated, it is better to use a separate css file.You can set CSS using three different ways as mentioned below :-Preferred / ideal way of setting the css style is using as external style sheets when the style is applied to many pages. 

With an external style sheet, you can change the look of an entire Web site by changing one file.sample usage can be :-If you want to apply a unique style to a single document then you can use Internal style sheet.  Don't use inline style sheet,as it mixes content with presentation and looses many advantages.

In other words, div + p is a proper subset of div ~ p — anything matched by the former is also matched by the latter, by necessity.The difference between + and ~ is that ~ matches all following siblings regardless of their proximity from the first element, as long as they both share the same parent.Both of these points are most succinctly illustrated with a single example, where each rule applies a different property. Notice that the one p that immediately follows the div has both rules applied:Unfortunately, there isn't one yet.consider this example:1) Adjacent Sibling Selectors (S1 + S2)Adjacent sibling selector is used to select a specified element which is immediate next to another specified element.

What is the difference between visibility:collapse and display:none?

2010-09-12 17:37:17Z

What is the difference between visibility:collapse and display:none?Short version: The former is used to completely hide table elements. The latter is used to completely hide everything else.Long version: visibility: collapse hides an element entirely (so that it doesn't occupy any space in the layout), but only when the element is a table element.If used on elements other than table elements, visibility: collapse will act like visibility: hidden. This makes an element invisible, but it will still occupy space in the layout.display: none hides an element entirely, so it doesn't occupy any space in the layout, but it shouldn't be used on table elements.W3C Referencevisibility: collapse behaves exactly like visibility: hidden in most formatting contexts: the space required by the element is 'reserved' in the layout, but the element itself is not rendered, leaving a blank space where it would have been.There are three exceptions that I know of: table-rows, table-columns and flex items, in which visibility: collapse behaves like display: none, but with one major difference: the 'strut'. You can think of the strut as a zero-sized placeholder, that doesn't claim any space of its own in the layout process, but is nevertheless still part of the formatting structure and participates in some size computations.A collapsed table-row, for example, will not occupy any vertical space in the table, but the table columns will still be dimensioned 'as-if' the collapsed row and its contents were actually visible. This is to prevent columns from 'wobbling' as rows are toggled in and out. Likewise, a collapsed flex item doesn't occupy any space along the main axis, but still contributes to the flex line cross-size.'Do not use display: none with tables' is a valuable rule of thumb, but it doesn't tell the whole story. Here is a code snippet demonstrating the difference between display: none and visibility: collapse for a table row:visibility:collapse should only be used on tables. On other elements it will act as a visibility:hidden.visibility:hidden hide the element but still take the space of the element whereas display:none won't even keep the space.Resources :On the same topic :visibility:collapse has a display:none behavior only for table elements. On other elements, it should render as hidden.You can also apply visibility: collapse on an element under a flexbox container (a flex item). It will act as you're applying it on an element with display: table-row or display: table-column

Sorry. I was to quick in my wording. The <p> element doesn't allow any block content within - as specified by HTML spec for paragraphs.You can accomplish what you want, I think, simply by including the submit button within the paragraph:Just use the style float: left in this way:

Also, the <a> should include the navbar-btn class.The problem is that the selector for styling an anchor in a navbar is: .nav > li > a which means it has a higher precedence than a .navbar-btn.You can fix by just wrapping it in another tag like a span.

How does the CSS Block Formatting Context work? CSS2.1 specifications says that in a block formatting context, boxes are laid out vertically, starting at the top. This happens even if there are floated elements in the way, except if the block box established a new block formatting context. As we know, when browsers render block boxes in a block formatting context, the floated element is omitted, why does establishing a new block formatting context work?How are boxes (block boxes and inline boxes) laid out in the normal flow? I read somewhere that block elements generate block boxes, but floating elements are ignored when a user agent draws box and take them into account when they fill out content. Whilst floating elements will overlap other elements's boundary of the boxes, the solution is establishing a new block formatting context for the overlapped elements using overflow:hidden."New block formatting context is still block formatting", so when drawing a box, it will also treat the floating element as if it doesn't exit. Is that right or have I misunderstood "new block formatting context?"    I don't understand the meaning, I will provide an example, maybe you will understand me.I thought the floating box should float to the top of the containg block-the div with class content.

How does the CSS Block Formatting Context work? CSS2.1 specifications says that in a block formatting context, boxes are laid out vertically, starting at the top. This happens even if there are floated elements in the way, except if the block box established a new block formatting context. As we know, when browsers render block boxes in a block formatting context, the floated element is omitted, why does establishing a new block formatting context work?How are boxes (block boxes and inline boxes) laid out in the normal flow? I read somewhere that block elements generate block boxes, but floating elements are ignored when a user agent draws box and take them into account when they fill out content.

Besides, if the floating box appears earlier in the markup, then it will display what I think it should be.How can we explain this? Can we use "block formatting context and inline formatting context" to explain it?Block Formatting ContextsWith my bold, it's the establish bit that is importantWhat this means is that the element you use overflow (anything other than visible) or float or inline-block..etc on becomes responsible for the layout of its child elements. It's the child elements which are then "contained", whether that's floats or collapsing margins they should be wholly contained by their bounding  parent. What the above line means:Because a box can only be rectangular and not irregular shaped this means a new block formatting context between two floats (or even beside one) will not wrap around neighbouring side floats. The inner, child boxes can only extend as far as to touch their parents left (or right in RTL) edge. It's this behaviour that's useful for columnar style layouts. The main use of it however is to stop floats, say in a "main content" div, actually clearing floated side columns, i.e. floats that appear earlier in the source code.Float ClearanceIn normal circumstances floats are supposed to clear all previous floated elements, that's previously floated in the whole source code, not just your displayed "column"

The telling quote from the "float clearance specs" is:So say you have a three column layout where the left and right columns are floated left and right respectively, the side columns are now in new Block Formatting Contexts, because they are floated (remember float is also one of the properties that establish a new BFC), so you can happily float list elements inside them and they only clear floats which are already inside the side columns they no longer care about floats previously in the source codeNow that middle column, you can simply margin it from both sides so that it appears to sit neatly between the two side floated columns and take the remaining width, a common way to get desired width if the centre column is "fluid" - which will be fine until you need to use floats/clearance inside your content div (a common occurrence for those using "clearfix" hacks or templates including them)Take this very simple code:It produces the following:In general this is fine, especially if you have no background colours or internal (in the main content) floats -  notice the floats are fine (not cleared yet) they're doing probably what you except them to but they, the H3's top margin and the p's bottom margin are not actually really contained by the content div (lightgrey background). So to the same simple margined scenario of above code add:to the CSS, and change the second HTML floated box to:This time you get this:The second float is clearing the right side but it's clearing the whole height of the right column. The right column is floated earlier in the source code so it's clearing it as told! Probably not the desired effect though, also note the h3 and p margins are still collapsed (not contained).and finally make the main content column take responsibility - become a Block Formatting Context - for its contents : remove margin: 0 200px; from the main content CSS and ADD overflow: hidden; and you get this:This is probably much more like what you would expect to happen, note now the floats are contained, they clear properly ignoring the right side column, and also the h3 and p margins are contained instead of collapsed.With the extensive use of resets these days the margins are less noticeable (and IE still doesn't get them quite right) however what just happened to the centre "main content" is that it became a Block Formatting Context and is now responsible for its own child (descendant) elements. It's actually very similar to Microsoft's early days notion of hasLayout, it uses the same properties display: inline-block, float, and overflow anything other than visible, and of course table cells always have layout.. it is however without the bugs ;)Hope that helps a bit, any questions feel free to ask!When you say "but floating elements are ignored when user agent draws box and take them into account when they fill out content." Yes floats normally overlay their container boxes, is that what you mean about parent boundaries? When a block element is drawn and it contains a float the block parent itself is drawn as a rectangle under the float and it is the "inline anonymous boxes" or simply "line boxes" of the other child elements that are shortened to make room for the floatTake this code:Which produces this:You see that the parent element doesn't actually contain the float, as in it doesn't wrap it entirely.. the float is simply floating on top of the content - if you were to keep adding content to the div it would eventually wrap underneath the float because there would be no need for the (anonymous) "line boxes" of the p element to shorten themselves any more. I've coloured the paragraph element so you can see that it too actually goes under the float, the darkgray background is where the paragraph starts, the white text is where the "anonymous line box" starts - it's only actually them that "make room" for the float, unless you tell it otherwise (i.e. you change the context)Again referring to the above picture, if you were to margin the left side of thep element, yes it will stop the text wrapping under the bottom of the float because the "line boxes" (the white text) will only touch the left edge of their container, and you will bring the coloured background of the p to the right, clear of the float, but you won't have changed the behaviour of the p's formatting context. Like the centre column in the first picture way above ;)

You can do something like this:You can read more about the step-callback here: http://api.jquery.com/animate/#stephttp://jsfiddle.net/UB2XR/23/And, btw: you don't need to prefix css3 transforms with jQuery 1.7+You can wrap this in a jQuery-plugin to make your life a bit easier:http://jsbin.com/ofagog/2/editI optimized it a bit to make the order of easing, duration and complete insignificant.Thanks to matteo who noted an issue with the this-context in the complete-callback. If fixed it by binding the callback with jQuery.proxy on each node.I've added the edition to the code before from Update 2.This is a possible modification if you want to do something like toggle the rotation back and forth. I simply added a start parameter to the function and replaced this line:If anyone knows how to make this more generic for all use cases, whether or not they want to set a start degree, please make the appropriate edit.Mainly you've two ways to reach the desired result. But at the first, let's take a look on the arguments:jQuery.fn.animateRotate(angle, duration, easing, complete)Except of "angle" are all of them optional and fallback to the default jQuery.fn.animate-properties:This way is the short one, but looks a bit unclear the more arguments we pass in.I prefer to use objects if there are more than three arguments, so this syntax is my favorit:Thanks yckart! Great contribution. I fleshed out your plugin a bit more. Added startAngle for full control and cross-browser css.jQuery transit will probably make your life easier if you are dealing with CSS3 animations through jQuery.EDIT March 2014 

(because my advice has constantly been up and down voted since I posted it)Let me explain why I was initially hinting towards the plugin above:Updating the DOM on each step (i.e. $.animate ) is not ideal in terms of performance. 

It works, but will most probably be slower than pure CSS3 transitions or CSS3 animations. This is mainly because the browser gets a chance to think ahead if you indicate what the transition is going to look like from start to end.To do so, you can for example create a CSS class for each state of the transition and only use jQuery to toggle the animation state. This is generally quite neat as you can tweak you animations alongside the rest of your CSS instead of mixing it up with your business logic:If any of the transform parameters is dynamic you can of course use the style attribute instead:A lot more detailed information on CSS3 transitions on MDN. HOWEVER There are a few other things to keep in mind and all this can get a bit tricky if you have complex animations, chaining etc. and jQuery Transit just does all the tricky bits under the hood:To do this cross browser including IE7+, you will need to expand the plugin with a transformation matrix. Since vendor prefix is done in jQuery from jquery-1.8+ I will leave that out for the transform property.Note: The parameters options and startAngle are optional, if you only need to set startAngle use {} or null for options.Example usage:See also this jsfiddle for a demo.Update: You can now also pass extra: {} in the options. This will make you able to execute other animations simultaneously. For example:This will rotate the element 90 degrees, and move it to the right with 100px and make it semi-transparent all at the same time during the animation.this is my solution:then you can use it in the default animate fkt:Another answer, because jQuery.transit is not compatible with jQuery.easing. This solution comes as an jQuery extension. Is more generic, rotation is a specific case:The usage is as simple as:Without plugin cross browser with setInterval:

Difference between jQuery .hide() and .css(「display」,「none」)

[Difference between jQuery .hide() and .css(「display」,「none」)](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/13562439/difference-between-jquery-hide-and-cssdisplay-none)

Is there any difference between and

2012-11-26 10:01:07Z

Is there any difference between andThe display property can have many possible values, among which are block, inline, inline-block, and many more.The .show() method doesn't set it necessarily to block, but rather resets it to what you defined it (if at all).In the jQuery source code, you can see how they're setting the display property to "" (an empty string) to check what it was before any jQuery manipulation: little link.On the other hand, hiding is done via display: none;, so you can consider .hide() and .css("display", "none") equivalent to some point. It's recommended to use .show() and .hide() anyway to avoid any gotcha's (plus, they're shorter).Difference between show() and css({'display':'block'})Assuming you have this at the beginning:when you call:you will get:while:does:so, yes there's a difference.Difference between hide() and css({'display':'none'})same as above but change these into hide() and display':'none'......Another difference

When .hide() is called the value of the display property is saved in jQuery's data cache, so when .show() is called, the initial display value is restored!Yes there is a difference in the performance of both:

jQuery('#id').show() is  slower than jQuery('#id').css("display","block") as in former case extra work is to be done for retrieving  the initial state from  the jquery cache as display is not a binary attribute it can be inline,block,none,table, etc.

similar is the case with hide() method.See: http://jsperf.com/show-vs-addclassno difference Same about showYes there is a difference.jQuery('#id').css("display","block") will always set the element you want to show as block.jQuery('#id').show() will et is to what display type it initially was, display: inline for example.See Jquery DocYou can have a look at the source code (here it is v1.7.2). Except for the animation that we can set, this also keep in memory the old display style (which is not in all cases block, it can also be inline, table-cell, ...).see http://api.jquery.com/show/With no parameters, the .show() method is the simplest way to display an element:$('.target').show();The matched elements will be revealed immediately, with no animation. This is roughly equivalent to calling .css('display', 'block'), except that the display property is restored to whatever it was initially. If an element has a display value of inline, then is hidden and shown, it will once again be displayed inline.

I am creating a registration form for a website. I want each label and its corresponding input element to appear on the same line. Here's my code:Assuming you want to float the elements, you would also have to float the label elements too.Something like this would work:Alternatively, a more common approach would be to wrap the input/label elements in groups:Note that the for attribute should correspond to the id of a labelable element, not its name. This will allow users to click the label to give focus to the corresponding form element.I found "display:flex" style is a good way to make these elements in same line. No matter what kind of element in the div. Especially if the input class is form-control,other solutions like bootstrap, inline-block will not work well.Example:More detail about display:flex:flex-direction:   row, columnjustify-content:  flex-end, center, space-between, space-aroundalign-items:      stretch, flex-start, flex-end, centeraaa##HTML

I would suggest you wrap them in a div, since you will likely end up floating them in certain contexts. Then within that div, you can make each piece inline-block so that you can use vertical-align to center them - or set baseline etc. (your labels and input might change sizes in the future...jsFiddleThis is how I do things these days.jsFiddleWhat you were missing was the float: left; here is an example just done in the HTMLThe more efficient way to do this is to add a class to the labels and set the float: left; to the class in CSSAside from using floats, as others have suggested, you can also rely on a framework such as Bootstrap where you can use the "horizontal-form" class to have the label and input on the same line. If you're unfamiliar with Bootstrap, you would need to include:It's very straight forward and you wouldn't have to mess with floats or a ton of CSS for formatting, as you listed above.

For Bootstrap 4 it could be done with class="form-group" style="display: flex" I've done this several different ways but the only way I've found that keeps the labels and corresponding text/input data on the same line and always wraps perfectly to the width of the parent is to use display:inline table.CSSHTMLWrap the label and the input within a bootstraps div I am using Angular 6 with Bootstrap 4 and find this way works:This thing works well.It put radio button or checkbox with label in same line without any css.

<label><input type="radio" value="new" name="filter">NEW</label>

<label><input type="radio" value="wow" name="filter">WOW</label>

Another option is to place a table inside the form. (see below) I know tables are frowned upon by some people but I think they work nicely when it comes to responsive form layouts.

How can I achieve something like this in bootstrap 4?Looking at the codeply provided it doesn't size properly, especially if you add some data to the table. See how this runs:Updated 2018Make sure your table includes the table class. This is because Bootstrap 4 tables are "opt-in" so the table class must be intentionally added to the table.http://codeply.com/go/zJLXypKZxLBootstrap 3.x also had some CSS to reset the table cells so that they don't float..I don't know why this isn't is Bootstrap 4 alpha, but it may be added back in the final release.

A workaround is to use the d-inline-block class on the table cells to prevent the default display:flex of columns.Another option in BS4 is to use the sizing utils classes for width...Bootstrap 4 Alpha 6 DemoLastly, you could use d-flex on the table rows (tr), and the col-* grid classes on the columns (th,td)...Bootstrap 4.0.0 (stable) DemoNote: Changing the TR to display:flex can alter the bordersAnother option is to apply flex styling at the table row, and add the col-classes to the table header / table data elements:I hacked this out for release Bootstrap 4.1.1 per my needs before I saw @florian_korner's post.  Looks very similar.  If you use sass you can paste this snippet at the end of your bootstrap includes.   It seems to fix the issue for chrome, IE, and edge.  Does not seem to break anything in firefox.or if you just want the compiled css utility:Using d-flex class works well but some other attributes don't work anymore like vertical-align: middle property.The best way I found to size columns very easily is to use the width attribute with percentage only in thead cells.Disclaimer: This answer may be a bit old.

http://codepen.io/poopsplat/pen/cGBLyFor the same shadow but only on the top :To have the shadow in one direction you have to negate the "blur" parameter with the "spread" parameter and then adjust the "h-pos" and/or "v-pos" parameters by this same value.

It doesn't work with opposite border or triple border. You have to add one more definition.More examples here : http://codepen.io/GBMan/pen/rVXgqPNo, not directly, but you can crop off the parts that you don't want by putting it in a div with overflow: hidden:http://jsfiddle.net/Vehdg/I just had this problem myself. The solution that I found was with multiple box-shadows (one for each side that you want your shadow). Here is the definition: Here is how to think it:Here you can see my case with box-shadow on three sides (left, top, right and the bottom is with same color as the background to create the effect that I wanted - the left side and the right go all the way to the bottom)

You can't change that (yet?). The 4 sizes in the box-shadow definition are OffsetX, offsetY, Blur and Spread.Multiple box shadows did the trick for me.http://jsfiddle.net/kk66f/

Thanks for any help in advance.(Though Ana's answer came in months after mine, probably using mine as a base to "think from", the fact that she was able to come up with a method using a single div is worth promoting, so check out her answer too--but note that content in the hex is more limited.)This was a truly amazing question. Thank you for asking it. The great thing is the fact that:Original Fiddle Used (modified in later edit to fiddle link above)--it utilized imgur.com images, which were not seeming to be very reliable in loading, so the new fiddle is using photobucket.com (let me know if there are persistent image loading issues). I've kept the original link because the explanation code below goes with that (there are a few differences in background-size or position to the new fiddle).The idea came to me almost instantly after reading your question, but took some time to implement. I originally tried getting a single "hex" with a single div and just pseudo elements, but as best I could tell, there was no way to just rotate the background-image (which I needed), so I had to add some extra div elements to get the right/left sides of the hex, so that I could then use the pseudo elements as a means of background-image rotation.I tested in IE9, FF, and Chrome. Theoretically any browser supporting CSS3 transform it should work in.First Main Update (added explanation)I have some time now to post some code explanation, so here goes:First, hexagons are defined by 30/60 degree relationships and trigonometry, so those will be the key angles involved. Second, we start with a "row" for the hex grid to reside in. The HTML is defined as (the extra div elements help build the hex):We are going to use inline-block for the hexagon display, but we don't want them to accidentally wrap to the next line and ruin the grid, so white-space: nowrap solves that issue. The margin on this row is going to depend on how much space you want between hex's, and some experimentation may be needed to get what you want.Using the immediate children of the .hexrow which are just div elements, we form the basis for the hex shape. The width will drive the horizontal of the top of the hex, the height is derived from that number since all the sides are equal length on a regular hexagon. Again, margin is going to depend on spacing, but this  is where the "overlap" of the individual hexagons is going to occur to make the grid look occur.  The background-image is defined once, right here. The shift left on it is to accommodate at least the added width for the left side of the hex. Assuming you want centered text, the text-align handles the horizontal (of course) but the line-height that matches the height is going to allow for a vertical centering.Each odd number hex we are going to shift down in relation to the "row" and each even shift up. The shift calculation ( width x cos(30) / 2 ) is also the same as (height / 4).We are using 2 child div elements to create the "wings" of the hex. They are sized the same as the main hex rectangle, and then rotated, and pushed "below" the main hex. Background-image is inherited so that the image is the same (of course), because the image in the "wings" is going to be "lined up" to that in the main rectangle. The pseudo elements are used to generate the images, because they need to be "rerotated" back to horizontal (since we rotated the parent div of them to create the "wings").The :before of the first will translate its background the width of the negative amount equal to the main portion of the  hex plus the original background shift of the main hex. The :before of the second will change the origin point of  the translation and will shift the main width on the x-axis, and half the height on the y-axis.This span houses your text. The line-height is reset to make the lines of text normal, but the vertical-align: middle works since the line-height was larger on the parent. The white-space is reset so it allows wrapping again. The left/right margin can be set to negative to allow the text to go into the "wings" of the hex.You can individual target rows and cells in those rows to change images, or span text settings, or opacity, or accommodate a larger image (to shift it to the place you want), etc. That is what the following do for the second row.It actually can be done with just one element per hexagon and pseudo-elements for the background image and text.Basic HTML structure:You can have may more rows, you just need to have n hexagons on odd rows and n+/-1 hexagons on even rows.Relevant CSS:I will provide a simple demo of how to create a hexagonal shape.Here is another approach using COMPASS/SCSS, that allows easily set the hexagons size and layout:http://codepen.io/interdruper/pen/GrBEkif you are able to implement the div shapes trick, then simply give each div a position:relative (you would have to initially position them all one by one at first, by also setting top and left)You can create a fully responsive hexagonal grid using only CSS.

The idea is to create a parent shape as a mask using CSS2.1 overflow:hidden which is compatible with almost all browsers, even internet explorer 6.It is a surprisingly simple technique that can be used for creating a responsive grid of all kinds of shapes, it just requires thinking outside of the box to solve the problem.I have an extensive step by step guide on how to do this technique here:

https://www.codesmite.com/article/how-to-create-pure-css-hexagonal-gridsThis is the best way I have found so far, requires no javascript and is both fluid and responsive.I also used the technique in a free HTML template that includes images inside the hexagons which you can demo and download here: https://www.codesmite.com/freebie/hexa-free-responsive-portfolio-templateAFAIK, there is no way of doing in in pure CSS. Your best bet would be to use mask clipping for backgrounds as explained here: http://www.cssbakery.com/2009/06/background-image.html (this will only work if your page background is solid color or you can fit and position your mask to match page background.Then you could use csstextwrap to fit in the text:

I’ve just spent some time (again) investigating a tableless solution but failed. I’ve tried various combinations of floats, absolute/relative positioning and similar approaches.

What is the cleanest way to align properly radio buttons / checkboxes with text? The only reliable solution which I have been using so far is table based:This may be frown upon by some. I’ve just spent some time (again) investigating a tableless solution but failed. I’ve tried various combinations of floats, absolute/relative positioning and similar approaches. Not only that they mostly relied silently on an estimated height of the radio buttons / checkboxes, but they also behaved differently in different browsers. Ideally, I would like to find a solution which does not assume anything about sizes or special browser quirks. I’m fine with using tables, but I wonder where there is another solution.I think I have finally solved the problem. One commonly recommended solution is to use vertical-align: middle:The problem, however, is that this still produces visible misalignments even though it should theoretically work. The CSS2 specification says that:So it should be in the perfect centre (the x-height is the height of the character x). However, the problem seems to be caused by the fact browsers commonly add some random uneven margins to radio buttons and checkboxes. One can check, for instance in Firefox using Firebug, that the default checkbox margin in Firefox is 3px 3px 0px 5px. I'm not sure where it comes from, but the other browsers seem to have similar margins as well. So to get a perfect alignment, one needs to get rid of these margins:It is still interesting to note that in the table based solution the margins are somehow eaten and everything aligns nicely.The following works in Firefox and Opera (sorry, I do not have access to other browsers at the moment):The CSS:I found the best and easiest way to do it is this one because you don't need to add labels, divs or whatsoever.input { vertical-align: middle; margin-top: -1px;}I wouldn't use tables for this at all. CSS can easily do this. I would do something like this:Note: I have used the clearfix class from : http://www.positioniseverything.net/easyclearing.htmlThis is a bit of a hack but this CSS seems to get it working very nicely in all browsers the same as using tables (apart from chrome)Make sure you use labels with your radios for it to work. i.e.If your label is long and goes on multiple rows setting the width and display:inline-block will help.I found the best fix for this was to give the input a height that matches the label.  At least this fixed my problem with inconsistencies in Firefox and IE.The following code should work :)Regards,This is a simple solution which solved the problem for me:There are several ways to implement it:Below I will insert a checkbox dynamically. Style is included to align the checkbox and most important to make sure word wrap is straight. the most important thing here is display: table-cell; for the alignmentThe visual basic code.'the code to dynamically insert a checkbox'create the checkbox'connect the checkbox'the style for the checkboxand the HTML output@sfjediI've created a class and assigned the css values to it.It is working and you can check it in the below link.

E.g. @import url("~./foobar");Saw it here, not sure if it's some package specific thing or if it's actual CSS syntax.The CSS @import path <url> is usually relative to the current working directory. So using the prefix ~ at the start of the path tells the Webpack loader to resolve the import "like a module" from a node module path.What that means is that if you have a node module called normalize installed, and you need to import a file from within it named /normalize.css, you can do that with:In your linked example, inside font-loader/example/test.js there is an import of a module called font-boon.Inside of font-loader/example/test.css the font-boon module is @imported so that it is available in text.css.@import url("~./font-boon");

Without a unit, that isn't really possible.Also, CSS minifiers strip the units off of 0 values anyways, so it won't really matter in the end.They are the same. The browser interprets both as 0, so go with whatever is more readable for you.Zero of anything is zero. 0px = 0% = 0em = 0pt = 0Most people leave the unit off because it is simply unnecessary clutter.As far as I'm aware there is no difference between them, since 0px = 0em = 0ex = 0% = 0. It's purely up to you, as the developer, to decide what you like best (unless you have corporate coding standards that you need to follow, of course). From most of the code samples I've seen, most people use the unitless version. To me, it just looks cleaner. If you're pushing a significant amount of data (say, if you're Google), those two bytes can add up to a lot of bandwidth, especially since you're quite likely to repeat them multiple times in your stylesheet.Zero pixels is equal to zero inches and zero meters and so forth. 0 is all you need.I personally find 0 cleaner than 0px. That's two extra characters that can add up. Why add extra bytes when you don't need to. I have see padding: 0px 0px 0px 0px which can easily be expressed as padding: 0 way too often. You can use either - my best advice is not to worry too much but be consistent in doing it either one way or the other. I personally prefer to specify '0px' for the following reasons:As the others say, it doesn't really matter if its 0, though I choose to add the measurements to all of my values so anyone else looking at my CSS files can gauge what measurements they're likely to deal with elsewhere.

From reading this post I have found that there are some pseudo classes for 'valid' and 'invalid' input values introduced to HTML5.Is there a way I can mark an input field as invalid/valid from javascript? Or alternatively, can I override the validation method used?

2012-05-27 23:26:02Z

From reading this post I have found that there are some pseudo classes for 'valid' and 'invalid' input values introduced to HTML5.Is there a way I can mark an input field as invalid/valid from javascript? Or alternatively, can I override the validation method used?You could use the customValidity function for this purpose.If you add a customValidity message to the field, it becomes invalid. When you set the message as an empty string, it becomes valid again (unless it is invalid because of other reasons).field.setCustomValidity("Invalid field."); will make the field invalid.field.setCustomValidity(""); will make the field valid unless it fails an HTML5 constraint.Edit:

Someone clarified that you're looking for "valid" "invalid" attributes for DOM.I would add attributes to each tag using dom_object.setAttribute("isvalid", "true"). You could also have a central validation function which updates these attributes each time (and use dom_object.getAttribute("isvalid") each time).You could run this function each time an element loses focus, or whenever you want.Not exactly elegant, but unfortunately there's no "pseudo" support with javascript and HTML5 now.If I understand your question, you can do validation with Javascript. However, be warned that it is very easy to circumvent client side validation, especially javascript validation. You should never trust client data and always do checking on the server side. For example, I could easily find element IDs by inspecting the source code, then do document.getElementById('some_id').setAttribute('max', new_number) to change the max value (this was one of the entries from your link).There are various ways to do it, so I'll try to give you the general idiom.You can grab the value by doing document.getElementById('form_element_id').value (make sure you give the form a name which is sent to the server, and an id which is used by javascript). For textareas, you can use .innerHTML.Then you have the value in a variable, there are various ways to check it.For example, you could do if (parseInt(my_value) < 0) //error.

You could also use regular expressions, I won't explain it all but you could start here http://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_obj_regexp.asp . I know w3schools isn't the best source but I find it an okay place to start.Now for the validation part: add onsubmit="return validateForm() to your form tag where validateForm() is the function which does all the checking.  And the function just returns true if valid and false otherwise. This overrides the default validation function (which by default does nothing).So in the above example, //error would be replaced by return false. You can do other things too; such as alert the error then return false. You could also use javascript to highlight the invalid fields (not sure if this is what you mean by "mark an input field as invalid/valid from javascript")Of course, if you don't want to check all the fields you only have to return true if the certain ones pass. Again, you shouldn't rely on this, but if you're only out to deter average people then it's an easy solution.Unfortunately, you can't style pseudo classes in JavaScript, since they're not real elements, they don't exist in the actual DOM.With vanilla JavaScript you'd use the validation API.In jQuery you can simply do this, http://jsfiddle.net/elclanrs/Kak6S/If you're using HTML5 validation, then stick to the markup. Otherwise, you can disable HTML5 validation with $form.attr('novalidate', 'novalidate') and use JS to validate your fields, and then adding valid or invalid classes where needed. I made a plugin that works like this to support non HTML5 browsers.

I don't understand why the margins of these divs are overlapping.

2010-10-11 13:27:55Z

I don't understand why the margins of these divs are overlapping.I think it's a collapsed margin.

Only the largest margin between the bottom of the first element and the top of the second is taken into account.It is quite normal to don't have too much space between two paragraphs eg.You cannot avoid that with two adjacent elements so you have to enlarge or reduce the larger margin.EDIT: cf. W3CSo there is no collapsing with float which takes the element out of the flow.Margins, in contrary to padding (which pads a specific width) is a「do this as a minimum distance」.It won’t put that distance to all elements.As you can see, the get in touch block bottom margin is marged to the input box. That is the margin active here.

The other margin, top margin from the input, is not in effect, as it’s smaller and does not reach a block-element where it would actually push back the element. The 2 margins overlap and don’t affect one another.If you can not use padding and really need for margin not to overlap, here is one trick:Please launch this snippet for demo:Watch out for display: flex on the parent element.Add a clear div tag between the two objects

I used centering techniques from this answer:

How to center absolutely positioned element in div?There are 2 potential issues that I see:1 - IE has had trouble with position:fixed in the past. If you are using IE7+ with a valid doctype or a non-IE browser this isn't part of the problem2 - You need to specify a width for the footer if you want the footer object to be centered. Otherwise it defaults to the full width of the page and the auto margin for the left and right get set to 0. If you want the footer bar to take up the width (like the StackOverflow notice bar) and center the text, then you need to add "text-align: center" to your definition.

How can I zoom an HTML element in Firefox and Opera?The zoom property is working in IE, Google Chrome and Safari, but it’s not working in Firefox and Opera.Is there any method for adding this property to Firefox and Opera?Try this code, this’ll work:You can refer to this.Zoom and transform scale are not the same thing. They are applied at different times. Zoom is applied before the rendering happens, transform - after. The result of this is if you take a div with width/height = 100% nested inside of another div, with fixed size, if you apply zoom, everything inside your inner zoom will shrink, or grow, but if you apply transform your entire inner div will shrink (even though width/height is set to 100%, they are not going to be 100% after transformation).For me this works to counter the difference between zoom and scale transform, adjust for the intended origin desired:Use scale instead! After many researches and tests I have made this plugin to achieve it cross browser:usege:note:It will create a wrapper with a class scaleContainer. Take care of that while styling content.I would change zoom for transform in all cases because, as explained by other answers, they are not equivalent. In my case it was also necessary to apply transform-origin property to place the items where I wanted.This worked for me in Chome, Safari and Firefox:use this to be on the safer sideIt does not work in uniform way in all browsers.

I went to to: http://www.w3schools.com/html/tryit.asp?filename=tryhtml_pulpitimage and added style for zoom and -moz-transform. I ran the same code on firefox, IE and chrome and got 3 different results.try this code to zoom the whole page in fireFoxif I am using this code, the whole page scaled with y and x scroll not properly zoom****does this work correctly for you? : For me this works well with IE10, Chrome, Firefox and Safari:This zooms all content in  to 50%.I've been swearing at this for a while. Zoom is definitely not the solutions, it works in chrome, it works partially in IE but moves the entire html div, firefox doesnt do a thing.My solution that worked for me was using both a scaling and a translation, and also adding the original height and weight and then setting the height and weight of the div itself:Obviously change these to your own needs. It gave me the same result in all browsers.Only correct and W3C compatible answer is: <html> object and rem. transformation doesn't work correctly if you scale down (for example scale(0.5). Use: and use in your code "rem" unit (including styles for <body>) instead metric units. "%"s without changes. For all backgrounds set background-size. Define font-size for body, that is inherited by other elements.if any condition occurs that shall fire zoom other than 1.0 change the font-size for  tag (via CSS or JS).for example:This makes equivalent of zoom:0.5 without problems in JS with clientX and positioning during drag-drop events. Don't use "rem" in media queries. You really doesn't need zoom, but in some cases it can faster method for existing sites.

I have this CSS code with an inline-block. Can anyone tell me how to make it work in Internet Explorer 6 and 7. Any ideas? Maybe I'm doing something wrong? Thank you!In IE6/IE7, display: inline-block only works on elements that are naturally inline (such as spans).To make it work on other elements such as divs, you need this:*display: inline uses a "safe" CSS hack to apply to only IE7 and lower.For IE6/7, zoom: 1 provides hasLayout. Having "layout" is a prerequisite for display: inline-block to always work.It is possible to apply this workaround while keeping valid CSS, but it's not really worth thinking about, particularly if you're already using any vendor prefixed properties. Read this for more information about display: inline-block (but forget about -moz-inline-stack, that was only required for the now ancient Firefox 2).*display:inline works fine as IE7 hack. But, you can add zoom:1 to the code as *background:#fff; *display:inline; zoom:1. Here, you can put your background color code. Sometime, you will not see the layout on the screen, say, for example, list-items will not appear on screen. Then, in such cases this works great and appear as it does in other browsers.

This is simple and works pretty well.The best solution, for me, is to wrap input [type="file"] in a  wrapper, and add some jquery code:I came up with a hacky solution that totally removes "No file chosen" plus the extra space that is added after that text (in Chrome I get something like: 

"No file chosen                   "). This was totally messing up my page alignment, so I really fought with it to find a solution. Inside the input tag's style attribute, setting "width" to the width of the button will eliminate the trailing text and spaces. Since the width of the button is not the same in all browsers (it's a little smaller in Firefox, for example), you'll also want to set the style's color to the same color as the background of the page (otherwise a stray "No" may show through). My input file tag looks like this: It works for me!Then, you can use different kind of styles such as width, height or other properties in order to create your own input file.

I've got this code:Running in a full-screen web-app on iPhone.When selecting something from this list, the iPhone zooms in on the select-element. And doesn't zoom back out after selecting something.How can I prevent this? Or zoom back out?It is probably because the browser is trying to zoom the area since the font size is less than the threshold, this generally happens in iphone.Giving a metatag attribute "user-scalable=no" will restrict the user from zooming elsewhere. Since the problem is with select element only, try using the following in your css, this hack is originally used for jquery mobile.HTML :CSS:src: unzoom after selecting in iphoneuser-scalable=no is what you need, just so there's actually a definitive answer to this questionThis seemed to work for my case in addressing this issue:Suggested here by Christina Arasmo BeymeriPhone's will zoom form fields slightly if the text is set to less than 16 pixels. I'd suggest setting the mobile form field's text to be 16 pixels and then override the size back down for desktop.The answers saying to disable zoom are unhelpful for partially sighted users may still want to zoom on smaller mobiles.Example:I am a bit late to the party, but I found a pretty neat workaround that solves this issue only with css manipulation. In my case I couldn't change the font size due to design reasons, and I couldn't disable zooming as well.Since iPhone's will zoom form fields slightly if the text is set to less than 16 pixels, we can trick the iPhone to think that the font size is 16px and then transform it to our size.For example, lets take the example when our text is 14px, so it does zoom because it is smaller than 16px. Therefore we can transform the scale, according to 0.875.In the following example I've added the padding to show how to convert other properties accordingly.I hope it helps!Try this:DisablePinchZoom will be fired before the onchange so zoom will be disable at the time the onchange is fired.

On the onchange function, at the end you can restore the initial situation.Tested on an iPhone 5SiOS zooms the page to show a larger input field if its font-size is less than 16px.only On click of any field, it's zooming the page. so on click, we are making it as 16px and then changed to default valuebelow snippet works fine to me and targeted for mobile devices,Set all 'select' font size to 16pxselect{

font-size: 16px;

}I don't think you can't do anything about the behavior in isolation.One thing you can try is keep the page from zooming at all. This is good if your page is designed for the phone.Another thing you could try is using a JavaScript construct instead of the generic "select" statement. Create a hidden div to show your menu,  process the clicks in javascript.Good luck!As answered here: Disable Auto Zoom in Input "Text" tag - Safari on iPhoneYou can prevent Safari from automatically zooming in on text fields during user input without disabling the user’s ability to pinch zoom. Just add maximum-scale=1 but leave out the user-scale attribute suggested in other answers.It is a worthwhile option if you have a form in a layer that「floats」around if zoomed, which can cause important UI elements to move off screen.<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1">Try adding this CSS to disable Ios' default styling:This will also work on other elements that get special styling, like input[type=search].Been reading for a few hours on this and the best solution is this jquery here.  This also helps with the "next tab" option in iOS Safari.  I have inputs here as well but feel free to remove them or add as you like.  Basically the mousedown fires before the focus event and tricks the browser into thinking its 16px.  In addition, the focusout will trigger on the "next tab" feature and repeat the process.

Out of curiosity, considering the example below, why does having the margin on the #container div cause a vertical scrollbar to appear in the browser? The container is much smaller in height than the body height which is set to 100%.I have set the padding and margins to 0 for all elements except the #container. Note that I have deliberately omitted absolute positioning on the #container div. In this case how is the browser calculating the height of the body and how is the margin affecting it?Example also on JSFiddleIf you paint the backgrounds of html and body (giving each its own color), you'll quickly notice that body is being shifted down along with #container, and #container itself isn't offset from the top of body at all. This is a side effect of margin collapse, which I cover in detail here (although that answer describes a slightly different setup).It's this behavior that's causing the scrollbar to appear, since you've declared body to have 100% the height of html. Note that the actual height of body is unaffected, as margins are never included in height calculations.A bit late, but maybe it helps someone.Adding float: left; to #container removes the scrollbar, as W3C says: •Margins between a floated box and any other box do not collapse (not even between a float and its in-flow children).Based upon @BoltClock♦'s answer, I fixed it by zeroing the margin...

soworks where id "st-full-pg" is assigned to a panel div (which further contained panel-heading and panel-body)adding float:left; is nice, but will interfere with central horizontal positioning using margin:auto;if you know how big your margin is, you can account for that in your height percentage using calc:browser support is good, but only IE11+

https://caniuse.com/#feat=calcAdd overflow: hidden; to html and body.This worked for meI have found a solution: add padding: 1px 0; to body prevents vertical scrollbars to appearInspired by @BoltClock, I tried this and it worked, even when zoom out and in.Browser: Chrome 51I guess body was shifted down 20px. If you want to remove the body scrolling add the following style:I saw this problem fixed before where you put all the contents of body in a div called wrap. Wrap's style should be set to position: relative; min-height: 100%;. To position #container div 50px from the top and left put a div inside wrap with a padding set to 50px. Margins will not work with wrap and the div we just made, but they will work in #container and everything inside it.here's my fix on jsfiddle.For those who are coming here for an easier to understand answer that even includes code samples, this answer (copied from here) is for you.No JavaScript or definite pixel values (such as 100px) are required, just, pure CSS and percentages.If your div is just sitting there on its own, height: 50% will mean 50% the height of the body. Normally, the height of the body is zero without any visible content, so 50% of that is just, well, zero.This is the solution (based on this) (uncomment the background lines to get a visualisation of the padding):The above was written so that there would still be the usual padding. You could set the dimensions of the red div to 100% and still see padding on each side/end. If you don't want this padding, use this (although it doesn't look nice, I recommend you stick with the first example):I found a quick solution: try set height to 99.99% instead of 100%

Code is here: http://lasers.org.ru/vs/example.htmlHow to remove an empty space under main block (#page)?Well, don't use relative positioning then. The element still takes up space where it originally was when using relative positioning, and you can't get rid of that. You can for example use absolute positioning instead, or make the elements float beside each other.I played around with the layout a bit, and I suggest that you change these three rules to:Another trick which worked fine for me is to use a negative margin-bottom in the relative element that you have moved. No need to go with absolute positioning.Something like:Similar (if not identical) to the solution I see now, from green.Try this rule:I changed position to absolute, this allows you to use the bottom: 0 property.I had a similar problem. The easiest way is to replace top on margin-top for #page.I had the same issue. Negative margin didn't work for me as it left a massive white area where it used to be.  I solved this problem in my case by manually entering height. I was able to get rid of the whitespaces using the following framework:And here is the markupThis question seems to be well answered - however all the answers above had bad side effects in my layout. This is what really worked for me:My answer is late but it may help others with a similar issue that I had.I had a <div> with position: relative; where all the child elements have the position: absolute; style. This caused around 20px of white space to appear on my page.To get around this I added margin-top: -20px; to the next sibling element after the <div> with position: relative;. If you have a sibling element before, you can use margin-bottom: -20px;

just add background-clip: padding-box to your td element.See this article for more information: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/CSS/background-clipJust to put all in one place.The problem is produced when you have a cell with position relative inside a table with collapsed borders (as Boris indicated and filled in the bug https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=688556)This can be easily solved using CSS as indicated by user2342963 (Adding background-clip: padding-box to the cell).You can see the problem (with Firefox) and the fix here: http://jsfiddle.net/ramiro_conductiva/XgeAS/This is a bug in firefox and hopefully they fix it soon.  But in the mean time I was able to fix this issue for me by setting my td cells to position: static.

So are the border-collapse and background-clip properties. Works with background-color on all and alternating rows.

I can see that this code works to align a div vertically within its parent element:The question is why? My first thought was that the parent element encompassed more than the viewport. I made my parent viewport height equal 100vh and width 100%. That did not work. I still needed the translate or a negative margin offset. Why do I need a negative offset when the parent element is set to margin: 0;? Is it because of a computed margin that I'm not taking into account?By default, your element is at the top of the page, and the top of the element is at 0:When you move it down by 50% height (50% of the entire page), the top of the element is at the 50% mark, meaning the element starts at 50% and is not centered.When the top of the element is at the halfway mark, we can move the element back up by half of its own height to center it with the whole page. That's exactly what transform:translateY(-50%); does:But why can't we just say top: 25% or something like that? I've made a quick snippet to show you the difference with that implementation:While others have provided the answer that the -50 moves the inner element back up half it's own height, I thought this little animation showing the movement to top: 50%; first, followed by transform: translateY(-50%); second, might help.… moves the element down a distance equal to half the height of the parent.Since the default position puts the top of the inner element at the top of the outer element, this puts the top of the inner element at the middle of the outer element.This moves the inner element back up a distance of half the height of the inner element.Combining them puts the middle of the inner element at the middle of the parent element.Rather than answering this question directly, I'm going to answer the more general question of:How does position anchoring work in CSS?Hopefully, in answering the question generally, you'll understand the parts that apply to your specific case.Position anchoring is when a DOM node is positioned in a way that it is "anchored" to its parent in a given dimension. If the top left of the node is anchored to the top left of its parent, the nodes will stay aligned at their top left corner, no matter the size of either element.I'm going to use a template for all further examples, so it's important to understand the base example.This example shows a parent .container which has dark red, dark yellow, dark green, and dark blue quadrants to easily view alignment. Inside, it contains a .box which has red, yellow, green, and blue quadrants to show contrast for the alignment.All further examples will have this boilerplate minified to make the relevant code stand out more.Note that by default, the top left of the child is anchored to the top left of the parent.Parent anchoring can be adjusted by using the top, bottom, left, and right properties on the child element.Using the top property will anchor the top edge of the child to the top edge of the parent.Assuming bottom isn't set, top: 0 won't show differently than the default of top: autoUsing a percentage will align the top edge of the child at the given percentage from the top of the parent.top: 50% is the middle of the parent:top: 100% is the bottom of the parent:Bottom anchoring will anchor the bottom edge of the child to the bottom edge of the parent:bottom: 50% is the middle of the parent, with the child aligned opposite from top: 50%:bottom: 100% is the top of the parent:The left property will anchor the left edge of the child to the left edge of the parent.Assuming right isn't set, left: 0 won't show differently than the default of left: auto.left: 50% is the middle of the parent:left: 100% leaves the child hanging off the right side of the parent.The right property will anchor the right edge of the child to the right edge of the parent:right: 50% is the middle of the parent, with the child aligned opposite from left: 50%:right: 100% leaves teh child hanging off the left side of the parent.Child anchoring can be adjusted independently from parent anchoring by making use of the transform property. Specifically the translate, translateX, and translateY functions will be used to bump the child box to use a different alignment.The reason this works is because percentages in the translate value are relative to the child, while percentages in the top, bottom, left, and right properties are relative to the parent.Using transform: translateY(), the alignment of the child can be bumped up or down.transform: translateY(0) will leave the child where it is, and is generally not very useful.When the child is anchored to the top of the parent, transform: translateY(-50%) will align the child at its center:Likewise, when the child is anchored to the bottom of the parent, transform: translate(50%) will align the child at its center:This also means that top: 100% is equivalent to bottom: 0; transform: translateY(100%):Using transform: translateX(), the alignment of the child can be bumped left or right.transform: translateX(0) will leave the child where it is by default.When the child is anchored to the left of the parent, transform: translateX(-50%) will align the child at its center:Likewise, when the child is anchored to the right of the parent, transform: translateX(50%) will align the child at its center:left: 100% is equivalent to right: 0; transform: translateX(100%).Centering is just a matter of aligning the child to the middle of the parent, and then bumping the child's origin into place.Because of the symmetry, you could also use:

But this is a way where I explicitly state the color after the link is visited, which is again a color change.How can I disable the color change of an anchor tag when visited without doing any explicit color changes?You can't. You can only style the visited state.For other people who find this, make sure that you have them in the right order:If you just want the anchor color to stay the same as the anchor's parent element you can leverage inherit:  Notice there is no need to repeat the rule for each selector; just use a comma separated list of selectors (order matters for anchor pseudo elements).  Also, you can apply the pseudo selectors to a class if you want to selectively disable the special anchor colors:Your question only asks about the visited state, but I assumed you meant all of the states.  You can remove the other selectors if you want to allow color changes on all but visited. For :hover to override :visited, and to make sure :visited is the same as the initial color, :hover must come after :visited.So if you want to disable the color change, a:visited must come before a:hover. Like this:To disable :visited change you would style it with non-pseudo class:Either delete the selector or set it to the same color as your text appears normally.I think if I set a color for a:visited it is not good: you must know the default color of tag a and every time synchronize it with a:visited.I don't want know about the default color (it can be set in common.css of your application, or you can using outside styles).I think it's nice solution:HTML:CSS:You can solve this issue by calling a:link and a:visited selectors together. And follow it with a:hover selector. Use:But it will only affect links that haven't been clicked on yet.

This solution should cover that:Note that outline doesn't work in older browsers (IE7 and earlier).Alternately, you can stick with the borders and use negative margins:HTML:​CSS:DemoInclude ie9.js for IE8 support (it's very useful for all CSS selectors/pseudo-elements).Another solution one might consider is using the CSS Adjacent sibling selector.You can use odd selector to achieve thisIf the divs all have the same class name:There's a JSFiddle demo here.Add the following CSS to the div on the right:Or just remove one of the borders.I just usein the parent elementCSS:jsFiddle

    ​My use case was for boxes in a single row where I knew what the last element would be.I know this is a late reaction, but I just wanted to drop my 2 cents worth, since my way of doing it is not in here.You see, I really don't like playing with margins, especially negative margins. Every browser seems to handle these just that tad bit different and margins are easily influenced by a lot of situations.My way of making sure I have a nice table with divs, is creating a good html structure first, then apply the css.Example of how I do it:Now, for the css, I simply use the rows structure to make sure the borders are only where they need to be, causing no margins;Et voila, a perfect table.

Now, obviously this would cause your DIVs to have 1px differences in widths (specifically the first one), but for me, that has never created any issue of any kind. If it does in your situation, I guess you'd be more dependant on margins then.Using Flexbox it was necessary to add a second child container to properly get the outlines to overlap one another...SCSSI'm late to the show but try using thhe outline property, like so:Outlines in CSS do not occupy physical space and will therefore overlap to prevent a double border.I was able to achieve it using this code:What about giving a margin:1px; around your div.DEMOI prefer to use another div behind them as background and delete all the borders. You need just to calculate the size of the background div and the position of the foreground divs. 

Should I avoid using「text-align: justify;」?

[Should I avoid using「text-align: justify;」?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/315845/should-i-avoid-using-text-align-justify)

Is there any reason to avoid using text-align: justify;?  Does it reduce readability or cause problems?

2008-11-24 23:16:17Z

Is there any reason to avoid using text-align: justify;?  Does it reduce readability or cause problems?Firstly, this is purely a design-related problem and solution. The design of your grid  specifies if justifying text is needed. I think justify align alone has no major effect on usability. Bad typography that makes text illegible is what decreases usability. That said, make sure you have solid contrasts and a good balance of spacing in your type. Font-size matters too.This site is a successful attempt at justifying text online. Since you can't control the  spaces between letters and words nearly as much with CSS as you can with InDesign, it's a lot harder to justify text and not have 'rivers' of whitespace run down your rows, which happens when the spaces between words exceeds the spaces between lines. Things that make justifying text difficult: long words, row widths that don't hold enough words, and too much contrast between the text and the background colors; they make the rivers appear wider and more apparent.The typographic ideal is to have an even text-block, where if you squint the text block becomes a uniform solid shade. So if you keep text at about 10px and 60% gray on white background, and have rows that fit about 20 words, justify align shouldn't look ugly. But keep in mind this does nothing to improve usability. Small, relatively light text annoys a lot of people, especially the older readers. I should note that with &shy; (soft hyphenation) correctly separating long troublesome words like super­awesome you can mimic proper typesetting (e.g. InDesign). There's a lot of stuff out there to help you do this. I would recommend the logic for hiding, manipulating, and displaying the text to be done on the client side, perhaps with this.Edit: As others mention below, css hyphens are possible now, except not feasible (not in Chrome). Plus, css4 offers even more control.text-align: justify shouldn't be used in browsers at the moment. They aren't good at handling the minute details within and the output ends up containing lots of rivers and there's no support for hyphenation (other than soft hyphens).Note above was written 4.5 years ago. Things are slowly changing... http://caniuse.com/#feat=css-hyphensEdit:

Hyphenator was brought to my attention in this answer's comments. It looks like it makes text-align justify worth using, check out the sites that use it. You may want to use javascript to apply text-align justify before using this script so that those without javascript don't get caught out.Edit 2:

CSS now allows for hyphenation with the hyphens property [browser support]. PPK is now saying to add it to your stylesheets, whilst Eric Meyer says just add it for mobile.Edit 3:

A good little overview of things available to us now, with some SASS.The problems brought up by others about justify alignment are more prevalent with narrow columns. If your columns are wide enough in relation to the size of your fonts and other parameters then it's ok to justify the text. Let's say you'd want a minimum of 12 to 15 words per line in average. More is better.There's no technical reason not to - it's purely a design decision. Many people find that justified text is harder to read, but I guess it depends on your situation. Though it works fine for print, generally web browsers do not give enough control over the eventual output of text to guarantee that what you're serving won't look like crap on some people's screens.Your best option is to avoid justification.I cant think of a compelling reason why not to justify text - at a certain point the volume and width of content almost demand that it be justified. Of course, you'll get issues with content consisting of certain word combinations, but to my mind if you're seeing rivers and unusually large spaces between words you have a different problem altogether - one of readability and clarity.What I would avoid, at all costs, is centered body text. I don't think there's a greater red flag of ammateurish web design than that.I prefer left justification (text-align: left) because it's generally more readable.  It's also quicker to read evenly-spaced words, so I hear.  Unless you have a stylistic reason for using justify, keep it left, right, or center.  Especially for body text, use left.  (Actually, you'd want something like "forward" for text in the other direction (e.g. Hebrew)...)Like any web design question... it depends. As has been suggested, justified text does not usually end up looking good in narrow columns. I'd recommend against it as a general rule in sidebars as sidebars are usually narrow.With body copy at the often recommended 10 words per line (or with any amount above that) you will probably be able to get away with justified text and have it look reasonably good most of the time unless you're using a lot of really long words and/or strings.I think I've pimped this site on StackOverflow before, but Jon Tan uses justified text in his body copy (within articles) and it looks great 99.99% of the time.Justification should not be used without hyphenation. Here is a PHP based hyphenation library, and a port of this library to a WordPress plugin:  wp-Typography.I think it is perfectly OK on print, but it is clunky on most Web browsers, by lack of fine control of spacing and hyphenation. Typographers can even play slightly on letter spacing or font contraction in some cases, as pages/columns (at least in magazines) can be finely tuned.Erhh... No...![seriously] WordPress uses justify, and I think that's a pretty strong statement in regards to whether or not it decreases readability...You can also use text-justify:newspaper. The text-justify css tag helps you control how you wrap the text when you justifyIt should be mentioned that Internet Explorer (at least) up to version 8 does not render text-align: justify correctly. Instead it is interpreted as text-align: center. Here is more info: text-align: justifyCaused me some headaches to find out why IE kept centering stuff. Maybe it saves somebody else some time.Text justification can be done in several ways.Couple of definitions:  Adjusting the spacing between words is "tracking"  Adjusting the spacing between characters is "kerning"  Good layout programs do some kerning automatically, and it varies by letter pair. The va of variable can be kerned closer than the xa in exact.  Good fonts have built in tables of kerning hints to aid in this process.  In early days of monospace fonts it was done by inserting extra spaces between words.  This made for very clunky looking output. If you had 4 spaces at the end of the line, and 6 spaces in the line, 4 of them would become double spaces. Monospace fonts shouldn't be justified. With variable width fonts, we have em spaces, en spaces, etc, and so the space could be better distributed.I think this is where most browsers are now.  It works reasonably well most of the time.  For it to work well the following conditions need to hold:The average word in English is 5 characters.  So on the average you will have 5 characters (the 5 character word plus space wouldn't fit so gets bumped to the next line) If you have 10 words on the line, then you need to add about half a standard space to each interword gap.If the last word is a long one, like "headaches" and there isn't room for it, now you have 10 spaces to distribute.  This starts to look bad.This is where a hyphenation dictionary comes into play.  Hyphenation can be done by algorithm, but there are enough exceptions that having a dictionary helps a lot. (There is a special character ­ for soft hyphens for words not in your dictionary.) Hyphenation can split a word so that the the line fills more evenly.Empirically I decided that a 65 em line length made a good compromise.  This gives 11-13 words per line a lot of the time.  Another approach to justification is to split the space up between characters.  This avoids some of the problems above, but still looks odd if you are distributing a lot of space in not enough line. You see this in newspapers now and then where a word seems to have a full space between each character.  This is a good argument for a longer line. Good typesetting programs (InDesign, *TeX, Framemaker) do a combination of extra space in interword gaps, and tiny extra spaces between characters.There is a new kid on the block, text-justify that can be used in CSS to modify the use of text-align: justify.  Nominally it accepts the optionsCanIuse https://caniuse.com/#search=text-justify 

CSS working group https://drafts.csswg.org/css-text-3/#text-justify-propertyCanIuse reports compliance only for Firefox right now, Chrome supports it but requires that you enable experimental features.  CanIuse claims that support is buggy.  Going to the Chromium bug tracking site, claims that it's fixed.  Go figure.  Haven't tested.Other pragmatic points:I made four changes to my site's style sheet:The result was that time on site and pages per session doubled.  Anecdotal, but may be worth your own test.

My current understanding is that different HTML elements are separated in their functionality by their default CSS styling, semantics aside.Using custom CSS, you could (inadvisably) make any HTML element behave like any other.If that is correct, the only thing I cannot account for is the bullets on <li> elements. What CSS causes them? How can you add that to other elements?Note to future readers: I recently learned HTML elements also differ by content categories.The bullets are contained "within" the padding of <ul> element:The padding is marked green and the margin orange:Decreasing the padding shows that the bullets are "within" that padding:Increasing the margin of the <ul> for example, shifts it right.The list-style property controls the bullets themselves. Setting it to none will hide them. You would need to set the margin and padding to 0 if you want to get rid of the indent too.If you want to get rid of all margins / paddings and the bullet points, use this:Browsers typically have a "default stylesheet"—a set of CSS styles applying to specific HTML elements. Take a look at the Firefox default styles, Chrome's default styles, and IE's default styles.Typically, a <ul> tag has the following default overridable CSS styles:An <li> tag as the following:See this page https://css-tricks.com/almanac/properties/l/list-style/The bullets come from ul elements.

You can modify them using the properties  list-style-type or  list-style-imageThe round bullets for <li> elements is just the browser default. Just like it has a default font, fontsize, underline for links (blue), etc.

To make sure you overwrite the browser defaults , use some css reset http://cssreset.com/ , or bootstrap css.The style for <li> is defined by the <ul> or <ol> surounding it. for exampleI think the original question really was, "how can I add bullets to OTHER elements, since CSS supposedly lets you style anything (like p elements) to look like something else (like LI).The answer seems to be, LI is a special case, AFAIK. Could be wrong. I tried adding <style="display: list-item; list-style-type:disc;"> on <p> elements, and didn't get bullets. (Tested with Chrome only).You could actually add bullet characters (&bull;) manually or programmatically to the start of each p element, and set margin and padding to look like a UL/LI block, I guess.The bullets on list items are an example of generated content. Other examples of generated content include the numbers in ordered lists, CSS counters and the :before and :after pseudo-elements.Setting display: list-item on an element will make it display bullets. You can change the appearance and position too.See examples below:For more precise control I would suggest that you use pseudo elements (and CSS counters if you want to count).

It seems that fieldset defaults to 100% width of its container. Is there any way that you can have the field set just be as big as the widest control inside the fieldset?Use display: inline-block, though you need to wrap it inside a DIV to keep it from actually displaying inline.  Tested in Safari.fieldset {display:inline} or fieldset {display:inline-block}If you want to separate two fieldsets vertically, use a single <br/> between them. This is semantically correct and no harder than it has to be.You could float it, then it will only be as wide as its contents, but you'll have to make sure you clear those floats.Unfortunately neither display:inline-block nor width:0px works in Internet Explorer up to version 8. I have not tried Internet Explorer 9. Much as I would like to ignore Internet Explorer, I can't.  The only option that works on Firefox and Internet Explorer 8 is float:left. The only slight drawback is that you have to remember to use clear:both on the element that follows the form.  Of course, it will be very obvious if you forget ;-)You can always use CSS to constrain the width of the fieldset, which would also constrain the controls inside.I find that I often have to constrain the width of select controls, or else really long option text will make it totally unmanageable.This also works. try thisi fixed my issue by override legend style  as Below Going further of Mihai solution, cross-browser left aligned:Cross-browser right aligned:You can also put the fieldset inside a table, like so:

To account for the scenario @vsync mentioned, in the comment section (differentiating between emtpy/non-empty values), you could incorporate the CSS :not pseudo-class:https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:notYes in CSS 3 selectors there are several attribute selectors.E.g.Should add that if a browser sets an attribute by default you may need to work around. This does not appear to be an issue in "modern" brosers, however, this is an issue I have seen, so be sure to check cross-browser performance.For instance, I discovered that in IE prior to 9, colSpan is set for all TD's in a Table, so any single cell has the hidden colspan value of 1.So if you were targetting "any TD with colspan attribute" you apply in your webdoc, even the td's having no colspan attribute set, such as any TD being a single cell, will receive the css styling.  IE less than 9 will basically style them all!Only reason to concern over this is all the remaining XP users out there who cannot upgrade above IE8.So for Example, I have a group of tables where the content may shift from end to end, leaving anywhere from 1 to 7 cells blank either at the end or the beginning.I want to apply a color to any blank cells at the end or the beginning utilizing the colspan attribute.

Using the following will not work in IE less than 9...all TD's will get styled (funny since the conditional attribute styling was supposedly superior in IE, but I digress...).Using the following works across all browsers when I set the value of colspan to 'single' for any solitary cell/TD I wish to include in the styling scheme, however its a 'hack' and will not properly validate...Alternatively you should be able to more appropriately address the issue using conditional styling using "if lt IE 9" to override.  It would be the correct way to do this, just keep in mind you must hide the "properly constructed css" from IElt9 in the process, and I think the only proper way to do that is with selective style sheets.  Most of us already do that anyway, but regardless, you still do well to consider and test if a browser applies an auto-attribute when it sees none, and how it may handle your otherwise corect syntax for styling on attribute values.(btw, colspan just happens not to be in the css specification yet [as of css3], so this example throws no validation error.)

Thank you!Don't use opacity for this, set the background to an RGBA-value instead to only make the background semi-transparent. In your case it would be like this.See http://css-tricks.com/rgba-browser-support/ for more info and samples of rgba-values in css.For a fully transparent background use: Otherwise for a semi-transparent color fill use: where the values are:You can also use rgba values for gradient backgrounds.To get transparency on an image background simply reduce the opacity of the image in an image editor of you choice beforehand.opacity will make both text and background transparent. Use a semi-transparent background-color instead, by using a rgba() value for example. Works on IE8+If you use RGBA for modern browsers you don't need let older IEs use only the non-transparent version of the given color with RGB.If you don't stick to CSS-only solutions, give CSS3PIE a try. With this syntax you can see exactly the same result in older IEs that you see in modern browsers:

Simple question... How do I change the cursor type on a file input type?I've tried the following:For some reason, it won't play ball. 

2009-10-08 11:28:59Z

Simple question... How do I change the cursor type on a file input type?I've tried the following:For some reason, it won't play ball. Know this a old thread. But the google results brings this up... I Just found a partial solution to chrome (not invalving flash, javascript, extra DOM manipulation with overflow hidden).The problem is that button's doesn't inherit the cursor property in general(?) but the rest of the input[type=file] field dose.

Thats why chrome get the pointer except the buttonIt works differently in different browsers. I guess it's because the file input type is quite special.What browser/version do you use?I know that IE6 does not support to specify the type in the style.Works perfectly.Issue is fixed, so now it works perfectly. See bug report on this issue.

In version 3.5 it did not work at all.Uses arrow over the button, but your defined cursor over the rest.Works perfectly.Note that there are several workarounds using different techniques that will come around this problem. The answer by BjarkeCK is one elegant solution that I like, and it works on all major browsers. cursor:pointer does not work on input file just because of the default button. No special reason here. You need to remove its appearance via this code, pay attention with font-size:0.It works perpectly on Chrome, Firefox and IE. I met this issue today and with:It seems to do fine :-)If

you want to force the cursor to be hand in order to put it on an image, here is aHTML:JQuery:Then you can press on any button to upload file, and you have a pointer cursor .In Chrome and Opera the cursor becomes a pointer on the padding only and if display:block; , that's why for those browsers you should do this:I made the following:for li:for input:As it was mentioned before, cursor becomes "pointer" on the whole input, excluding the button. In most browsers the button is on the left side or on the right side. Ok! Lets give the input a huge width and show only the middle... Button will be hidden. And clickable is the whole input.That works for me.If you're trying to do Ajax uploader, you might try another technique for compatible browsers such as FireFox and Chrome. They support triggering a click event on totally invisible file input. You can hide file input in any way you want except setting it's display property to none. Setting { height: 0; overflow: hidden } on parent form will do the trick. I use separate forms for each uploader.Redirect your custom button click event to hidden file input and you're done.To use this technique you must perform navigator.userAgent check for Gecko or WebKit engine. For other engines you have to use old transparent file input method.I found out that there's another approach to make it. Works perfectly in Opera New, FF, Chrome and Safari. Unfortunately it doesn't work perfect in IE (but good enough for my case).The idea is to wrap input=file element with fixed size div and hidden overflow and set cursor: pointer;. Than we move button outside of the div using left padding.and sample stylesHere you can find live example: http://jsfiddle.net/5c5RH/2/First of all, your code works on Internet Explorer, but doesn't on Firefox.Second, W3C Css standard doesn't allow styling complex tags like <input />. Even for cursor property.Endly, see this page. I did not try his solution, so tell us if it works and how.Chrome was giving me this problem too. I tried to set all sorts of CSS selectors, but nothing seemed to work well. However, I did find a solution by using the FORM element. I tested this in Chrome and FF, not ie, but I hope this helps.

jsfiddle http://jsfiddle.net/aressler38/L5r8L/1/Try using:See if that works. I've had to put pointer + hand in mine to make it work in FF/Chrome/etc. Also, I'm not sure if it matters but I don't think there are quotes around 'file' in the css.css: .btn{cursor:pointer;}You can see it in action here: http://blueimp.github.com/jQuery-File-Upload/It's not the jquery doing it. It's the http://blueimp.github.com/cdn/css/bootstrap-responsive.min.css file. I've just grabbed what I needed out of it and it works great without any of the jquery.Based on https://stackoverflow.com/a/3030174/2325676 - Hide the input using opacity 0. The key to getting the cursor to work on the entire area is setting the font-size to a value greater than the height of the button so that the file input button is pushed below the visible area and the mouse hover is on the text part of the file input:How I did it: And then on my view page:And then I simply submit my form via AJAX to the server and handle the rest there.So tl;dr -> I relay the click of the visible link (with all styles and bells and whistles) and I actually click the file input. :)Hope this helps someone.

(Here's a codepen with that fix.)More detailed explanation:Flex items establish a default minimum size that's based on their children's intrinsic size (which doesn't consider "overflow" properties on their children/descendants).Whenever you've got an element with overflow: [hidden|scroll|auto] inside of a flex item, you need to give its ancestor flex item min-width:0 (in a horizontal flex container) or min-height:0 (in a vertical flex container), to disable this min-sizing behavior, or else the flex item will refuse to shrink smaller than the child's min-content size.See https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1043520 for more examples of sites that have been bitten by this. (Note that this is just a metabug to track sites that were broken by this sort of issue, after this spec-text was implemented -- it's not actually a bug in Firefox.)You won't see this in Chrome (at least, not as of this posting) because they haven't implemented this minimum sizing behavior yet. (EDIT: Chrome has now implemented this min-sizing behavior, but they may still incorrectly collapse min-sizes to 0 in some cases.)

Search through your HTML and JS for onmousedown handlers and look for a line that reads.This line may be stopping you from focusing by clicking.Re: your comment, I'm assuming you can't edit the code that adds this handler?  If you can, the simplest solution is to just remove the return false; statement.That depends on how the handler is attached.  If it's attached using the traditional registration method, e.g. element.onmousedown, then you could create a wrapper for it:Since this "wrapper" doesn't return false, it will not cancel the default action (focusing) for the element.  If your event is attached using an advanced registration method, such as addEventListener or attachEvent then you could only remove the event handler using the function name/reference and reattach it with a wrapped function similar to the above.  If it's an anonymous function that's added and you can't get a reference to it, then the only solution would be to attach another event handler and focus the element manually using the element.focus() method.I had this problem too. I used the disableSelection() method of jQuery UI on a parent DIV which contained my input fields. In Chrome the input fields were not affected but in Firefox the inputs (and textareas as well) did not get focused on clicking. The strange thing here was, that the click event on these inputs worked.The solution was to remove the disableSelection() method for the parent DIV.I know this is a very old thread, but this just happened to me recently; took me a while to figure it out.  This same issue can be caused by putting 'input' elements inside of pair of 'label' tags.  In my case, I had intended to create a pair of 'div' tags but instead I accidently created a pair of 'label' tags, then inserted some text input fields 'input type="text"..' using DOM.  It displayed normally on the screen, but when I clicked on any of the text fields, the cursor kept jumping back to the first 'input' and really acting erratic.  Took me a while to figure this out because this behavior is subtle, and not at all what I would have expected from making this kind of mistake.bsniderUse the onclick="this.select()" attribute for the input tag.I've been struggling with the same problem a while ago. I was using the jquery.layout plugin in a modal jquery-ui dialog and I couldn't access any of the fields in it.It appeared to be a z-index problem (some div was over my input fields, so I couldn't click them). You should check it out and try changing the z-index value of your input fields.This happens sometimes when there are unbalanced <label> tags in the form. I had this problem too, and in my case I found that the color of the font was the same color of the background, so it looked like nothing happened.If you are faced this problem while using canvas with DOM on mobile devices, the answer of Ashwin G worked for me perfectly, but I did it through javascriptAfter, everything worked flawlessly.I have read all the answers above, and some directed me to the problem, but not to the solution for the problem.The root cause of the problem is disableSelection(). It is causing all the problems, but removing it is not a solution, as (at least in 2016 or slightly before), on touch-screen devices, you "have" to use this if you want to be able to move objects with jQuery.The solution was to leave the disableSelection() to the sortable element, but also add a binding action just above:The form in the jQuery element is just  to stop propagation on the form, as you might need propagation on some elements.This can occur in bootstrap if you do not place your columns inside a <div class ='row'>. The column floats are not cleared and you could get the next column overlying the previous, hence clicks wont hit the dom elements where you expect.I had the similar issue - could not figure out what was the reason, but I fixed it using following code. Somehow it could not focus only the blank inputs:I had this problem because of this code: I resolved it by removing New code:I'm using JQuery UI and Bootstrap so I faced this issue and I think it is a conflict between the two as in normal case the textarea or the input filed is editable by nature but I made this solution after testing all the above answers but none solve the cross browser support for all major browsers, but I solved it and I like to share my solution you can use it on input text and textarea (Tested on Desktop: IE (All Versions), Chrome, Safari, Windows Edge, Firefox, Visual Studio Cordova Ripple Viewer on Windows & Visual Studio Cordova Windows 10 Store App)(Tested on Mobile: Chrome, Firefox, Android Internet Browser & Visual Studio Cordova App on Android & Visual Studio Cordova Windows 8 + 8.1 + 10 Phone App)This is the HTML Code:This is The CSS Code:This Is The JQuery Code On Document ReadyYou can test it on my web application at www.gahwehsada.comWhen you sayIs this through viewing your html, the source code of the page, or the DOM?If you inspect the DOM with Chrome or Firefox, then you will be able to see any attributes added to the input fields through javasript, or even an overlaying divJust in case someone else is looking for this answer, we had a similar problem and solved it by changing the z-index of the input tags.  Apparently some other divs had extended too far and were overlapping the input boxes.I had this problem for over 6 months, it may be the same issue. Main symptom is that you can't move the cursor or select text in text inputs, only the arrow keys allow you to move around in the input field. Very annoying problem, especially for textarea input fields. I have this html that gets populated with 1 out of 100s of forms via Javascript:Apparently 6 months ago I had tried to make the popup draggable and failed, breaking text inputs at the same time. Once I removed  draggable="true" it works again!I just found another possible reason for this issue, some input textboxes were missing the closing "/", so i had <input ...> when the correct form is <input ... />. That fixed it for me.In my case it was Bootstrap popup in opened state.

Text input was in another calendar popup on top of Bootstrap one, input got its focus back after removing tabindex="-1" attribute from Bootstrap modal.iPhone6 chromeProblem for me  was placing the input field inside <label> and <p>like this :  I changed them to And it works for me . After check this answer, Please check other answers in this page, this issue may have different reasonsThis will also happen anytime a div ends up positioned over controls in another div; like using bootstrap for layout, and having a "col-lg-4" followed by a "col-lg=8" misspelling... the right orphaned/misnamed div covers the left, and captures the mouse events. Easy to blow by that misspelling, - and = next to each other on keyboard.  So, pays to examine with inspector and look for 'surprises' to uncover these wild divs.Is there an unseen window covering the controls and blocking events, and how can that happen?  Turns out, fatfingering = for - with bootstrap classnames is one way...    I had the same problem. I eventually figured it out by inspecting the element and the element I thought I had selected was different element. When I did that I found there was a hidden element that had z-index of 9999, once I fixed that my problem went away.the problem for me was that I was using  class="modal fade", I changed it for  class="modal hide". That solved the issue.I had the same problem. Tore my hair for hours trying all sorts of solutions. Turned out to be an unclosed a tag.Try validate your HTML code, solution could be an unclosed tag causing issuesI had this issue using Bootstrap + contact form 7.

I for some reason I put the label as the container of the form and that was the issue for not being selectable on mobile.Seemed to break all inputs except the first input and the submit. I had the same issue and the fix was to remove the placeholders and I changed the design of the form to use labels instead of placeholders...I had this issue caused by a sort of overlap of a div element with a bootstrap class ="row" over a "brother" div element with the class="col", the first hid the focus of the second div element. I solved taking outer the div row element from that level of the divs' tree and so rebalancing bootstrap logical hierarchy based on the row and col classes.I had this same issue just now in React.I figured out that in the Router, Route. We cannot do this as it causes this issue of closing the mobile keyboard.Make sure and use the render instead in this situationHope this helps someone Daniel

You have already solved the problem by removing the z-index from the parent, keep it like this or make the element a sibling instead of a child.To achieve what you want without removing any styles you have to make the z-index of the '.parent' class bigger then the '.wholePage' class.jsFiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/ZjXMR/2/ Give the parent z-index: -1, or opacity: 0.99Nothing is impossible.

Can a CSS px be a fraction? Is it allowed by the standards? And if so, do the major browsers support it?Let's back the answers up with documentation, folks.Yes, you can specify fractional pixels. As this has been part of CSS since the very first version, it should be well supported by any browser that supports CSS at all.Reference: CSS 2.1: 4.3.2 LengthsWhen the elements are displayed on the screen, most browsers will naturally round the position to the nearest pixel when using 100% zoom level. On higher zoom levels you will notice that fractional pixel values are recognized.

With this particular issue you should be targeting the ::-ms-expand pseudo element:But!, If we want to add width, we can not do so as: display:noneSo Internet Explorer 10 doesn't support conditional comments, so you'll have to do something else. One solution is to sniff the user agent with JavaScript and add the class yourself:You should probably add this in the <head> so that you don't have a flash of unstyled content, but that might not be a problem.Also, if you're using jQuery, you might want to do something like this:If you want to check for IE10 or above, copy-paste the getInternetExplorerVersion function from this Microsoft page and then change the if to something like this:I had an issue with a hidden drop down arrow on the site on IE 10 and 11 that I am working which uses Zurb Foundation.

Fortunately however, most browsers do still support the scrolling property (which was removed from the HTML5 specification).overflow isn't a solution for HTML5 as the only modern browser which wrongly supports this is Firefox.A current solution would be to combine the two:But this could be rendered obsolete as browsers update. You may want to check this for a JavaScript solution: http://www.christersvensson.com/html-tool/iframe.htmEdit: I've checked and scrolling="no" will work in IE10, Chrome 25 and Opera 12.12.I solved the same issue with this css:It seems to work using inside the IFrameedit:

However, scroll="no" did work.  Might be worth tryingAdd this styles..for your iframe tag..    Since the "overflow: hidden;" property does not properly work on the iFrame itself, but seems to give results when applied to the body of the page inside the iFrame, I tried this :Which surprisingly did work with Firefox, removing those annoying scrollbars.

More info on wikipediaThe length limits are different per browser - i believe IE8 allows up to 32KB and opera is 4KB, but can't really tell about other browsers...There are a lot of answers.  As the question was asked 5+ years ago, most are now incorrect due to becoming dated, yet this question sits at the top of Google results for "data uri limit".  Data URIs are now widely supported and IE 7/8 is no longer a relevant browser.  There are many references below because the answer is nuanced today.The data URI spec does not define a size limit but says applications may impose their own.One technology with a higher limit (500MiB in Chrome) that may be an alternative for your use case is Blob URLs via URL.createObjectURL() using the URL API together with blobs via the File API.  An example of that is provided in Using URL.createObjectURL().A few other alternatives as mentioned in How to write a file / give it to the user are: FileSaver.js, StreamSaver.js, and JSZip.You can use Modernizr to detect support for data URIs over 32kb.These answers are pretty much the same as this question, but I mention them to save you the time of reading each one.I just made a quick check embedding eight different Jpeg-images ranging from 3,844 to 2,233,076 Bytes in size.All of the following browsers displayed every image correctly on my Windows 7 (64-bit) system:From http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2397.txt:I've read that Safari has a limit of 128K for data URIs:http://blog.clawpaws.net/post/2007/07/16/Storing-iPhone-apps-locally-with-data-URLs#c1989348And Chrome is 2M:http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=44820#c1It is really the "data URI scheme".As per the Wikipedia page, IE7 lacks support, and IE8 betas limit it to 32kB of data.2017 answer is:

convert data: to blob with function: dataURLtoBlobthen create blob urlthen use it in new window if you need.works with big files in chrome/firefox 2017Just an FYI, I was able to load a 130K image using a data url in Firefox 3.5 from a JavaScript ajax call. It truncated the image in IE 8, but the whole thing showed up in FF.Seems the limit in Firefox 3.6 is 600KB. I tried the code from waza123 but the charCodeAt method did not convert all characters correctly. Here is my solution for creating large downloads in the browser. (I used it for JSON data)Note: There are some additional restrictions in IE. For iframe is a limit of 4 kb.MSDN

Also, if possible, it's better that the css doesn't know about the component height in pixels.

That way I can reuse the css for different elements.I've written an Angular directive that does slideToggle() without jQuery.https://github.com/EricWVGG/AngularSlideablesThis is actually pretty easy to do. All you have to do is change the css.Here's a fiddle with a very simple fade animation: http://jsfiddle.net/elthrasher/sNpjH/To make it into a sliding animation, I first had to put my element in a box (that's the slide-container), then I added another element to replace the one that was leaving, just because I thought it would look nice. Take it out and the example will still work.I changed the animation css from 'fade' to 'slide' but please note that these are the names I gave it. I could have written slide animation css named 'fade' or anything else for that matter.The important part is what's in the css. Here's the original 'fade' css:This code changes the opacity of the element from 0 (completely transparent) to 1 (completely opaque) and back again. The solution is to leave opacity alone and instead change the top (or left, if you want to move left-right).I'm also changing from relative to absolute positioning so only one of the elements takes up space in the container at a time.Here's the finished product: http://jsfiddle.net/elthrasher/Uz2Dk/. Hope this helps!update for Angular 1.2+ (v1.2.6 at the time of this post):(plunker)This can actually be done in CSS and very minimal JS just by adding a CSS class (don't set styles directly in JS!) with e.g. a ng-clickevent. The principle is that one can't animate height: 0; to height: auto; but this can be tricked by animating the max-height property. The container will expand to it's "auto-height" value when .foo-open is set - no need for fixed height or positioning.see this fiddle by the excellent Lea VerouAs a concern raised in the comments, note that while this animation works perfectly with linear easing, any exponential easing will produce a behaviour different from what could be expected - due to the fact that the animated property is max-height and not height itself; specifically, only the height fraction of the easing curve of max-height will be displayed.I ended up abandoning the code for my other answer to this question and going with this answer instead.I believe the best way to do this is to not use ng-show and ng-animate at all.This class-based javascript animation works in AngularJS 1.2 (and 1.4 tested)Edit:  I ended up abandoning this code and went a completely different direction. I like my other answer much better. This answer will give you some problems in certain situations.});Simply add the .ng-hide-toggle-slidedown class to the container element, and the jQuery slide down behavior will be implemented based on the ng-hide class.    You must include the $(element).css({display:'none'}) line in the beforeRemoveClass method because jQuery will not execute a slideDown unless the element is in a state of display: none prior to starting the jQuery animation.  AngularJS uses the CSS          to hide the element.  jQuery is not aware of this state, and jQuery will need the display:none prior to the first slide down animation.The AngularJS animation will add the .ng-hide-animate and .ng-animate classes while the animation is occuring.You should use Javascript animations for this - it is not possible in pure CSS, because you can't know the height of any element. Follow the instructions it has for you about javascript animation implementation, and copy slideUp and slideDown from jQuery's source.What's wrong with actually using ng-animate for ng-show as you mentioned?

How does rem differ from em in CSS?

[How does rem differ from em in CSS?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/13941275/how-does-rem-differ-from-em-in-css)

In website source, I have sometimes seen developers use the rem unit.  Is it similar to em? I tried it to see what it actually does, but what is it relative to?DemoHTMLCSSEMs are relative to their parent's font sizeREMs are relative to a base font-sizeThis is important when intermediate containers change font sizes. Child elements with EMs will be affected, those using REMs will not.The unit rem (root em) stands for the font size of the root element. In an HTML document, the root element is the html element. Browser support is still limited.While em is relative to the font-size of its direct or nearest parent, rem is only relative to the html (root) font-size.em gives the ability to control an area of a design. As in, scale the type in that specific area relatively. 

rem gives the ability to scale type across the entire page easily.Here is an example. divs sized with rem change as we change the font-size of the html element. Whereas those sized with em only change as we change the font-size of the div.Basically em is relative to the nearest parent in CSS, while is rem is relative to the parent of the page which is usually the html tag...You see the difference clearly if you run the css below and how the parent is effecting it:Example:In the above example the green square is 160px by 160 px (unless you don't have browser default at 16px). This is because the browser default of the html element font-size is 16px and 10rem * 16px =  160.The inside square is 10em big. Because its parent element is 5px the square is 5em * 10px  =  50px.By setting all units to rem have the following advantages:rem , em and px are different units of font-size in css.em

An em is equal to the computed font-size of that element’s parent.

ex: div element defined with font-size: 16px, its children 1em = 16px.rem

rem values are relative to the root html element. 

ex: If font-size of the root element is 16px,1 rem = 16px for all elements.Reference:

Please don't suggest that I change the way it functions currently. Thanks!CSS transitions work by defining two states for the object using CSS.  In your case, you define how the object looks when it has the class "saved" and you define how it looks when it doesn't have the class "saved" (it's normal look).  When you remove the class "saved", it will transition to the other state according to the transition settings in place for the object without the "saved" class.If the CSS transition settings apply to the object (without the "saved" class), then they will apply to both transitions.We could help more specifically if you included all relevant CSS you're using to with the HTML you've provided.My guess from looking at your HTML is that your transition CSS settings only apply to .saved and thus when you remove it, there are no controls to specify a CSS setting.  You may want to add another class ".fade" that you leave on the object all the time and you can specify your CSS transition settings on that class so they are always in effect.The @jfriend00's answer helps me to understand the technique to animate only remove class (not add).A "base" class should have transition property (like transition: 2s linear all;). This enables animations when any other class is added or removed on this element. But to disable animation when other class is added (and only animate class removing) we need to add transition: none; to the second class.ExampleCSS:HTML:JS (only needed to add class):plunker of this example.With this code only removing of recently-updated class will be animated.Basically set up your css like:In my case i had some problem with opacity transition so this one fix it:Mouse EnterMouse Leave

Even though the pseudo element's width is compensated by a negative margin, the white space will make the line break when it meets the edge of the parent element. For example, this works:and this doesn't:This is a little similar to a previous answer, but I thought that I'd flesh it out and explain it fully.As soon as you set display: inline-block, :after becomes a non-text-binding element. This is why it wraps, and why nowrap has no effect. So leave display alone.As it's a text element by default, the content binds to previous text, as long as there's no whitespace between them. So don't add any, but make sure you have content: "", or it's the same as display: none. The only problem is height and width are controlled by the content, which in this case is collapsed. So width is 0, and height is the line height. Resize the area with padding; left or right, it doesn't matter. Add a little margin so the icon doesn't touch the text. Keep everything as relative sizes (em, pt, etc.), and use background-size: contain, so that the icon scales with the text, like an emoji or font. Finally position the icon where you want with background-position.I've used this for my external links (a[href*="://"]:after), and it's worked fine in Firefox, Chrome, and iOS. And since the icon remains a text element, even direct text after it binds, so any closing punctuation will wrap too.I was having the same issue. I didn't really like the idea of adding strong or span tags to the last word, so I tried simply adding the icon as a background image with some padding-right instead of using the :after or :before pseudo elements. Worked for me!http://jsfiddle.net/atcJJ/36/If using an icon font: Using the "non-breaking space" unicode \00a0 along with the pseudo-element content (in this case a Font Awesome glyph).This works without any extra mark-up or special formatting or classnames.The line-height: 0; part keeps the lines from twitching when the last 'word + icon' wrap.CodePen examplePlease make sure you end the  tag before Try the below css. Instead of using "after" use "before" and float right.Please check this:

http://jsfiddle.net/supriti/atcJJ/7/I was attempting this with a link button and had the most success with adding padding to the right of the element as @Hugo Silva suggested, then setting the ::after to absolute position.  This was a pretty simple solution and seemed to work across modern browsers.Here's a JS Fiddle.It is possible to do it without :after.

The element with background should be display:inline.http://jsfiddle.net/my97k7b1/

Any additional insights?The ::content pseudo-element is being replaced in future implementations of Web Components / Shadow DOM with the ::slotted pseudo-element. Likewise, the element targeted by this pseudo-element has changed from <content to <slot> in the latest version of the Shadow DOM specification. You can see related discussion about that change here.Currently browsers still support <content> and ::content.

Summary:::content is essentially a way to dig deeper and style descendants of the ShadowHost, which normally aren't available to be styled, because your CSS doesn't know to look for the ShadowDOM fragment without ::content.This answer assumes you are at least somewhat familiar with the <template> element and Web Components, specifically the ShadowDOM, which deals with ShadowTrees and their two main elements, ShadowHost and ShadowRoot.Note - As of this writing, there is less than 50% support (even prefixed, off-by-default support) for Web Components across the five major browsers. While all modern browsers support <template>, only recent versions of Chrome and Opera support the ShadowDOM fully; with Firefox supporting parts of it after you toggle the requisite feature in about:config (dom.webcomponents.enabled) to true. The goal of using the ShadowDOM is similar to MVC's separation of concerns. That is, we want to separate our content from our presentation and allow for encapsulated templates in our code to help make it more manageable. We have this already in various programming languages, but it's remained a problem for some time in HTML and CSS. Further, there can be conflicts with class names when styling elements in web apps. Normally, we interact with the LightDOM (a sort of "Light Realm"), but sometimes it would be helpful to take advantage of encapsulation. Crossing into this sort of "Shadow Realm" (part of Web Components) is a new method to prevent the problems mentioned above by allowing encapsulation. Any styles applied to markup in your ShadowTree won't apply to markup outside of your ShadowTree, even if the exact same classes or selectors are used. When the ShadowTree (which lives in the ShadowDOM) has a tree from the LightDOM distributed within it, and/or when the ShadowTree is rendered, the result is converted by the browser into what is called a composed tree. When the browser renders your code, content is being distributed and inserted at new locations other than where it was physically typed. This distributed output is what you see (and what the browser sees), and is called the composed tree. In reality, the content is not originally typed in the order that it now appears, but you won't know this, and neither will the browser. This separation between "end result" and "original code", if you will, is one of the main benefits of encapsulation.Web Components & the Future of CSS is a great 40-minute video on Web Components and specifically the ShadowDOM, pointed out to me by ZachSaucier.Specific to your question, the ::content pseudo element applies to what are called distributed nodes. A distributed node is another term for whatever you put within the <content></content> tags. The content is distributed from its place in the original markup to wherever you have placed your <content> tags in the template.So, when you need specificity in CSS, one way you can handle selectors normally is that you go to the parent element and add that in as part of the selector. Ex: if .container {} is not specific enough, you might use div .container {} or .main .container {} in order to make your selector work.Thinking about the point of the ShadowDOM, which is scoping and encapsulation, you have to realize that this new ShadowTree you've created is a completely new (discrete) DOM fragment. It's not in the same "Light Realm" as the rest of your content; it's in a "Shadow Realm". So, how does the CSS know to target this "Shadow Realm"? By using the ::content pseudo-element! HTML5Rocks has a great sequence of tutorials here, here, and here which cover more information and give some great examples (be sure to visit with Chrome or Opera until more browsers support these features).For example, see this modified and improved (by Leo) version of the code from HTML5Rocks:Also available on JSFiddle (Remember to visit in a WebKit-based browser like Chrome or Opera)Here you can see that the ::contentsection p pseudo element is first selecting the content of the ShadowRoot, which is the contents of the div element in your markup, and then specifying further by adding section p. This may seem unnecessary when compared to normal CSS selector usage (for example, why not just use section p {}?), until you recall that, when traversing a ShadowTree, you cannot normally select descendants of host elements (which distributed nodes are), because they are in the "Shadow Realm" I mentioned earlier. Too bad! Unfortunately ::content is v0, and was deprecated.You should now use the v1 ::slotted.Also, <content> was deprecated in favor of <slot>.Please see: http://hayato.io/2016/shadowdomv1/Also see: Web Components - why <content> was replaced with <slot>

Which is the correct syntax to animate the box-shadow property with jQuery?

2010-11-09 11:56:47Z

Which is the correct syntax to animate the box-shadow property with jQuery?Using Edwin Martin's jQuery plugin for shadow animation, which extends the .animate method, you can simply use the normal syntax with "boxShadow" and every facet of that - color, the x- and y-offset, the blur-radius and spread-radius - gets animated. It includes multiple shadow support.jQuery animates by changing the style property of DOM elements, which can cause surprises with specificity and moves style information out of your stylesheets. I can't find browser support stats for CSS shadow animation, but you might consider using jQuery to apply an animation-based class instead of handling the animation directly. For example, you can define a box-shadow animation in your stylesheet:You can then use the native animationend event to synchronise the end of the animation with what you were doing in your JS code:If you are using jQuery 1.4.3+ then you can take advantage of the cssHooks code that was added.By using the boxShadow hook: https://github.com/brandonaaron/jquery-cssHooks/blob/master/boxshadow.jsYou can do something like this:The hook doesn't let you animate the color yet but I am sure with some work that could be added.Example: http://jsfiddle.net/petersendidit/w5aAn/If you don't want to use a plugin, it can be done with a bit of CSS:Check it out: http://jsfiddle.net/Z8E5U/If you want full documentation on CSS animations, your path to wizardry begins here..I love the ShaneSauce solution !

Use a class intead of an ID and you can add/remove the effect to any element using jQuery addClass/delay/removeClass :Here is an example of how to do it without a plugin: jQuery animated Box  But it doesn't have the extra functionality that comes with the use of a plugin, but I personally like to see (and understand) the method behind the madness.

Vertically align text within input field of fixed-height without display: table or padding?

[Vertically align text within input field of fixed-height without display: table or padding?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/326650/vertically-align-text-within-input-field-of-fixed-height-without-display-table)

The line-height property usually takes care of vertical alignment, but not with inputs. Is there a way to automatically center text without playing around with padding?

2008-11-28 20:51:36Z

The line-height property usually takes care of vertical alignment, but not with inputs. Is there a way to automatically center text without playing around with padding?In Opera 9.62, Mozilla 3.0.4, Safari 3.2 (for Windows) it helps, if you put some text or at least a whitespace within the same line as the input field.(imagine an &nbsp after the input-statement)IE 7 ignores every CSS hack I tried.

I would recommend using padding for IE only. Should make it easier for you to position it correctly if it only has to work within one specific browser.I ran into this problem myself.  I found that not specifying an input height, but using the font-height and padding combined, results in vertically aligned text.For instance, lets say you want to have a 42px tall input box, with a font-size of 20px.  You could simply find the difference between the input height and the font-size, divide it by two, and set your padding to that amount.  In this case, you would have 22px total worth of padding, which is 11px on each side.That would give you a 42px tall input box with perfect vertical alignment.Hope that helps.I've not tried this myself, but try setting:Where 36px is the height of your input.I know I'm late to the party but hopefully this'll help anyone looking for a concise answer that does work across all major browsers (except IE6, we have decided to stop supporting that browser so I refuse to even look at it anymore).cheers!

JPIn my opinion, the answer on this page with the most votes is the best answer, but his math was wrong and I couldn't comment on it.I needed a text input box to be exactly 40 pixels high including a 1 pixel border all the way around.  Of course I wanted the text vertically aligned in the center in all browsers.1 pixel border top

1 pixel border bottom

8 pixel top padding

8 pixel bottom padding

22 pixel font size1 + 1 + 8 + 8 + 22 = 40 pixels exactly.One thing to remember is that you must remove your css height property or those pixels will get added to your total above.This is working in Firefox, Chrome, IE 8, and Safari.  I can only assume that if something simple like this is working in IE8, it should work similarly in 6, 7, and 9 but I have not tested it. Please let me know and I'll edit this post accordingly.this is correct way to set vertical-middle position.After much searching and frustration a combo of setting height, line height and no padding worked for me when using a fixed height (24px) background image for a text input field.Try :Because on some versions of IE (< 9) the property height is not properly interpreted.Go for line-height.The vertical-align tag works fine for the submit button but not for the text in the input field.

Setting line-height to the height of the input field works on all browsers. Incl IE7.Just don't set the height of the input box, only set the font-size, that will be okThis is how I do it.then inside your CSS file,  That should work for you.Late to the party, but the current answers won't work if you have box-sizing: border-box set (which a lot of people do for form elements these days).Just reset the box sizing for IE8 to box-sizing: content-box; then use one of the padding / height answer.The inner vertical alignment will depend on font height and input height, so, it can be adjusted using padding !!! Try some like :...Remember to adjust the values on css class according to your needs !Sorry in advance the simple answer...Just remove your title text and use the input placeholder for your label's title. Some visual and css work after that and your form will be looking tight and user friendly. I'm aware of the disadvantages but this will completely relieve the alignment wrestling.  I'm actually building one now that includes multi-step and css progress bar in WordPress...based off the ever popular Contact Form 7 plugin and it looks great. Let me know if you want a screenshot.Cheers!LaddtheImpalerIf your element is a block element contained/or with display like so:Or, with an fixed line-height, you can  set the vertical align like so:It won't work for other cases, but it works fine on these conditions.

I included a vertical flip class just in case you might want to use it too.Take a look at one of the many reflection.js type libraries,  They are pretty simple.  In IE they will take and use the 'flipv' filter, there is a 'fliph' filter too.  Inside of other browsers, it will create a canvas tag and use the drawImage.  Although Elijah's answer probably supports the same browsers.Just dug up this answer while trying to fix a bug, while the suggested answer is correct I have found that it breaks most modern CSS Linting rules regarding the inclusion of all vendor rules for the transform. However, including the -ms-tranform rule causes an odd bug in IE9 where it applies the filter and -ms-transform rules causing an image to flip and flip back again. Here is my suggested improvement which also supports CSS Lint rules:If you only want to flip a background image you can use the class on the internal elements inside a flipped div. Basically you're flipping the internal elements with the main div, but flipping each of them back. Works in Firefox anyway.Like this:

If a screen-reader needs to be able to interpret the email address, then a page-crawler would be able to interpret it as well.Also, the point of the mailto attribute is to be the standard of how to do email addresses on the web. Asking if there is a second way to do that is sort of asking if there is a second standard.Doing it through scripts will still have the same issue as once the page is loaded, the script would have been run and the email address rendered in the DOM (unless you populate the email address on click or something). Either way, screen readers will still have issues with this since it's not already loaded.Honestly, just get an email service with a half decent spam filter and specify a default subject line that is easy for you to sort in your inbox.What you're asking for is if the standard has two ways to do something, one for bots and the other for non-bots. The answer is it doesn't, and you have to just fight the bots as best you can.Defeating email bots is a tough one. You may want to check out the Email Address Harvesting countermeasures section on Wikipedia.My back-story is that I've written a search bot. It crawled 105,000+ URLs during it's initial run many years ago. From what I've learned from doing that is that web crawling bots literally see EVERYTHING that is text, which appears on a web page. Bots read everything except images.Spam can't be easily stopped via code for these reasons:I don't think it's possible to stop 100% of spam while using traditional email servers, without using filters on the email server and possibly using images.There is one alternative... You can also build a chat-like email client, which runs internally on a website. It would be like Facebook's chat client. It's "kind of like email", but not really email. It's simply 1-to-1 instant messaging with an archiving feature... that auto-loads upon login. Since it has document attachment + link features, it works kind of like email... but without the spam. As long as you don't build an externally accessible API, then it's a closed system where people can't send spam into it.If you're planning to stick with strictly traditional email, then your best bet may be to run something like Apache's SpamAssassin on a company's email server. You can also try combining multiple strategies as you've listed above, to make it harder for email harvesters to glean email addresses from your web pages. They won't stop 100% of the spam, 100% of the time... while also allowing 100% of the screen readers to work for blind visitors. You've created a really good starting look at what's wrong with traditional email! Kudos to you for that!A good screen reader is JAWS from Freedom Scientific. I've used that before to listen to how my webpages are read by blind users. (If you hear a male voice reading both actions [like clicking on a link] & text, try changing 1 voice to female so that 1 voice reads actions & another reads text. That makes it easier to hear how the web page is read for the visually impared.)Good luck with your Email Address Harvesting countermeasure endeavours!Here is an approach that does make use of JavaScript, but with a rather small foot-print. It's also very "ghetto", and generally I would not recommend an approach with inline JS in the HTML except you have an extreme reluctance to use JS, at all.data-contact is the base64 encoded email address. And, data-subj is an optional base64 encoded subject.The main challenge with doing this without JS is that CSS can't alter HTML attributes. (The article you linked is a "pie-in-the-sky" musing and does not have any bearing on what is possible today or in the near future.)The HTML entities approach you mentioned, or some variation of it, is likely the simplest option that will have some efficacy. Additionally, the iframe approach is clever and the server redirect approach is pretty awesome. But, all three are vulnerable to bots:With the approach outlined above, the use of a base64 encoded email address in a data-contact attribute is very "one-off" – as long as the scrapper is not specifically designed for your site, it should work. Simple + Lot of @ + Editable without toolsHave you considered using google's recaptcha mailhide? 

https://www.google.com/recaptcha/admin#mailhideThe idea is that when a user clicks the checkbox (see nocaptcha below), the full e-mail address is displayed.While recaptcha is traditionally not only hard for screen readers but also humans as well, with the roleout of google's nocaptcha recaptcha which you can read about

 here as they relate to accessibility tests. It appears to show promise with regards to screen readers as it renders as a traditional checkbox from their view.

Example #1 - Not secure but for easy illustration of the ideaHere is some code as an example without using mailhide but implementing something using recaptcha yourself: https://jsfiddle.net/43fad8pf/36/Note: In my example I have the e-mail in a javascript function. Ideally you would have the recaptcha validated on the server end, and return the e-mail, otherwise the bot can simply get it in the code.Example #2 - Server side validation and returning of e-mailIf we use an example more like this, we get additional security: https://designracy.com/recaptcha-using-ajax-php-and-jquery/Where verify.php is:People who write scrapers want to make their scrapers as efficient as possible. Therefore, they won't download styles, scripts, and other external resources. There's no method that I know of to set a mailto link using CSS. In addition, you specifically said you didn't want to set the link using Javascript.If you think about what other types of resources there are, there's also external documents (i.e. HTML documents using iframes). Almost no scrapers would bother downloading the contents of iframes. Therefore, you can simply do:index.html:frame.html:To human users, the iframe looks just like normal text. Iframes are inline and transparent by default, so we just need set its border and dimensions. You can't make the size of the iframe match its content's size without using Javascript, so the best we can do is giving it predefined dimensions.First, I don't think doing anything with CSS will work. All bots (except Google's crawler) simply ignore all styling on websites. Any solution has to work with JS or server-side.A server-side solution could be making an <a> that links to a new tab, which simply redirects to the desired mailto:That's all my ideas for now. Hope it helps.Short answer to fulfill all your requirements is that it's impossibleSome of the script-based options answered here may work for certain bots, but you wanted no-script, so, no, you can't. The one method I found effective is using it with css like below:<a href="mailto:myemail@ignore-domain.com">myemail@<span style="display:none;">ignore-</span>domain.comand then write a javascript to remove the ignoreme- word from the href="mailto:..." attribute with regex. This will hide email from bot as it will append ignore- word before real domain and this will work on screen reader and when user clicks on the link custom js function will remove the ignore- word from href attribute so it will open the real email.This method has been working very effectively for me till date. you can read more on this - http://techblog.tilllate.com/2008/07/20/ten-methods-to-obfuscate-e-mail-addresses-compared/

Is there a pseudo-class in CSS to specify Or is that the only way to specify an item that is not being hovered?I went through several CSS3 references, and I see no mention of a CSS pseudo-class to specify the opposite of :hover.Yes, use :not(:hover)jsBin demoAnother example; I think you want to: "when one is hovered, dim all other elements".If my assumption is correct, and assuming all your selectors are inside the same parent:Otherwise... simply use the default logic:There isn't such a pseudo-class. There doesn't need to be, when you can just use :not(:hover). The whole point of the :not() pseudo-class is to allow authors to write negations without having to specify separate negations of every existing (and future) dynamic pseudo-class where an element can only either match or not match the pseudo-class.For example, only some elements can either be :enabled or :disabled — most elements are neither because the semantics simply don't apply — but an element can only either be designated by the pointing device (:hover), or not (:not(:hover)). Providing negations that can already directly be achieved using :not() would greatly undermine its usefulness (though it could still be used to negate any other simple selector — or entire complex selectors down the road).The argument that such a pseudo-class would be computationally less expensive is pretty weak. The most naïve implementation of such a pseudo-class would be a literal :not(:hover) check, which would be no better. Any more complex or optimized implementations and you're asking vendors to implement a pseudo-class that is either as fast as or even faster than :not(:hover), something that's already uncommon enough of a use case considering the other options you have such as cascading and :not(:hover) (for whenever cascading isn't an option) that you readily have access to. It simply doesn't justify the time and effort to spec, implement and test an alternative to at least one other existing method that is 100% functionally equivalent (and one that applies to at least 80% of scenarios). And there's also the issue of naming such a pseudo-class — you haven't proposed a name for it, and I can't think of a good one either. :not-hover is only shorter by two bytes and only marginally less work to type. If anything, it's potentially more confusing than :not(:hover).If you are worried about specificity, note that the :not() pseudo-class itself is not counted for specificity; only its most specific argument is. :not(:hover) and :hover are equally specific. So specificity is not an issue either.If you are worried about browser support, such a pseudo-class, if introduced, would likely have either been introduced alongside :not(), or in a later level of Selectors, since it didn't appear in CSS2 (where :hover was first introduced more than 17 years ago, and first implemented in IE4 another year yet before). Introducing it in a later level would be pointless because authors would simply be forced to continue using :not(:hover) until browsers begin implementing this new pseudo-class anyway, and they would have no reason to switch.Note that this isn't the same as the following question, which talks about events vs states (it's originally about :focus rather than :hover, but the same principle applies): Does CSS have a :blur selector (pseudo-class)?is a normal (non hovered link)is a hovered link

How to calculate CSS letter-spacing v.s.「tracking」in typography?

I have instructions from a graphic designer for a layout that specifies "track 100" for some elements. In CSS letter-spacing is the equivalent property for "tracking".Given a value for tracking, how do you express this as a value for CSS in pixels?Do you have to use pixels?  The conversions I found is a tracking value of 1000 is equal to 1 em in CSS, so in your case tracking 100 should be 0.1 em.EDITTo go from EM to pixels use this site PXtoEM.com.  For your specific case 0.1 em converts to 2px.  However this is based on a 16pt font, so you will have to adjust for the specific font size you're using.TL;DR: divide the tracking by 1000 and use em'sA bit of background about letter-spacing is always applied to text so we should use a relative unit of length. As font-size can change by the user or even by cascade.The best unit of length for text is the em unit.Why is tracking different?Layout apps such as Adobe's Photoshop, Illustrator and InDesign use em's in their tracking but manipulate the unit so it's an easier number for designers to play with. To make it easier they times it by 1000.Converting tracking back to whole em'sTo do this we just need to divide the tracking number by 1000 to get the unit back to a whole em that CSS can use.So 50/1000 = 0.05em.Calculating this in CSS/SCSSIf you are using SCSS and want a reusable solution - here is a mixin.To use the above functions you can just do this.Alternatively you can just to the maths inline without a mixin so it's less abstracted:The output for the above examples will be:Note:

You should not use a pixel based value as pixels are fixed and break when:Additionally browsers render text different to how the graphic design programs do so don't be surprised if the designer tweaks the tracking/letter-spacing on review of the implementation.Tracking Conversion CSS「letter-spacing」For the most part the above answers are accurate enough, however, the 1000 that's being used assumes your font has an Em Size of 1000, and that's not always the case. I've seen fonts that have an Em Size of 1024, and some that were even 2048, which is obviously going to have an impact.You can find out a font's Em Size by opening it inside of something like Font Forge and then selecting the Elements -> Font Info menu item, and the General tab.If you have a font size in pixels you can use the following formula:tracking * font-size / 1000 = letter-spacing

The twitter bootstrap code has a lot of CSS properties with a !default at the end.E.g.What does !default do?UPDATEMy bad for not being clear. I am using the SASS part of Bootstrap.Twitter Bootstrap uses LESS as far as I've seen. On the other hand, !default is actually part of Sass, and is used for giving Sass variables ($var) default values, which would make it invalid in your given context, even in Sass.Besides, I've not been able to find any references to !default in the LESS documentation, and to my knowledge it is exclusive to Sass. Are you sure you found this in Bootstrap's source and not elsewhere? Because I honestly don't remember seeing Sass/SCSS code in Bootstrap's stylesheets.For what it's worth, the only valid token that starts with ! in CSS is !important, which you may already be aware of.!default is used often in Bootstrap Sass. It is similar to a reverse !important. All of Bootstraps Variables are set using !default to allow the developer to further customize bootstrap. With !default sass will only define a variable if it has not already been set.This allows for more flexibility. So Why is this important? 

Bootstrap is a package. Most people don't edit the Bootstrap source. NEVER UPDATE THE BOOTSTRAP SOURCE. To customize bootstrap you will add your own variable file and compile it with the bootstrap code but never touch the native bootstrap package. Bootstrap sass's page has the full skinny on how to customize and compile it in the documentations.I don't know why less does not do this. I have not worked much with less and do not know if it has it's own built in variable management. Example fiddle

https://jsfiddle.net/siggysid/344dnnwz/You can find the following exact definition and a decent explanation in sass-lang website in its doc section (variable) - default value:Normally when you assign a value to a variable, if that variable already had a value, its old value is overwritten. But if you’re writing a Sass library, you might want to allow your users to configure your library’s variables before you use them to generate CSS.

To make this possible, Sass provides the !default flag. This assigns a value to a variable only if that variable isn’t defined or its value is null. Otherwise, the existing value will be used.

I've been banging my head against the wall for hours trying to figure out this issue and think it must be something small I'm missing.  I've searched online, but nothing I have found seems to work.  The HTML is: My full CSS is:I'd like the sidebar to stretch in height with the content of my page and leave the sidebar bottom image always at the bottom of the sidebar.  UPDATE: As this answer is still getting votes both up and down, and is at the time of writing eight years old: There are probably better techniques out there now. Original answer follows below.Clearly you are looking for the Faux columns technique :-)By how the height-property is calculated, you can't set height: 100% inside something that has auto-height. This worked for meUntil CSS's flexbox becomes more mainstream, you can always just absolutely position the sidebar, sticking it zero pixels away from the top and bottom, then set a margin on your main container to compensate.JSFiddlehttp://jsfiddle.net/QDCGv/HTMLCSSNote: This is an über simple way to do this but you'll find bottom does not mean "bottom of page," but "bottom of window." The sidebar will probably abrubtly end if your main content scrolls down.I would use css tables to achieve a 100% sidebar height. The basic idea is to wrap the sidebar and main divs in a container.Give the container a display:tableAnd give the 2 child divs (sidebar and main) a display: table-cellLike so..Take a look at this LIVE DEMO where I have modified your initial markup using the above technique  (I have used background colors for the different divs so that you can see which ones are which)Flexbox (http://caniuse.com/#feat=flexbox)First wrap the columns you want in a div or section, ex:Then add the following CSS:Further to @montrealmike 's answer, can I just add my adaptation?I did this:I did the "101%" thing to cater for the (ultra rare) possibility that somebody may be viewing the site on a huge screen with a height more than 5000px!Great answer though, montrealmike. It worked perfectly for me.I have run into this issue several times on different projects, but I have found a solution that works for me. You have to use four div tags - one that contains the sidebar, the main content, and a footer. First, style the elements in your stylesheet:You can edit the different elements however you want to, just be sure you dont change the footer property "clear:both" - this is very important to leave in. Then, simply set up your web page like this:I wrote a more in-depth blog post about this at http://blog.thelibzter.com/how-to-make-a-sidebar-extend-the-entire-height-of-its-container. Please let me know if you have any questions. Hope this helps!Perhaps Multi-Column Layouts Climb Out of the Box is what you're looking for?i guess, today one would probably use flexbox for this. See the holy grail example.I was facing the same problem as Jon. TheLibzter put me on the right track, but the image that has to stay at the bottom of the sidebar was not included. So I made some adjustments...Important:Here's the css:And here's the html:I realise this is an old post but I was trying to work something out for my site to have a sidebar.

Would this work?I think your solution would be to wrap your content container and your sidebar in a parent containing div. Float your sidebar to the left and give it the background image. Create a wide margin at least the width of your sidebar for your content container. Add clearing a float hack to make it all work.use body background if you are using fixed width sidebar give the same width image as your side bar. also put background-repeat:repeat-y in your css codes.Position absolute, top:0 and bottom:0 for the sidebar and position relative for the wrapper (or container) witch content all the elements and it's done !Try this.  It forces navbar to grow as content added, and keeps main area centered.
