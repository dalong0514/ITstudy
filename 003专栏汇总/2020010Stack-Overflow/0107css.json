It is not guaranteed to work everywhere, and there might be differences in implementation among browsers and in the future browsers can drop support for it.More information can be found in Mozilla Developer Network documentation.In most browsers, this can be achieved using proprietary variations on the CSS user-select property, originally proposed and then abandoned in CSS 3 and now proposed in CSS UI Level 4:For Internet Explorer < 10 and Opera < 15, you will need to use the unselectable attribute of the element you wish to be unselectable. You can set this using an attribute in HTML:Sadly this property isn't inherited, meaning you have to put an attribute in the start tag of every element inside the <div>. If this is a problem, you could instead use JavaScript to do this recursively for an element's descendants:Update 30 April 2014: This tree traversal needs to be rerun whenever a new element is added to the tree, but it seems from a comment by @Han that it is possible to avoid this by adding a mousedown event handler that sets unselectable on the target of the event. See http://jsbin.com/yagekiji/1 for details.This still doesn't cover all possibilities. While it is impossible to initiate selections in unselectable elements, in some browsers (Internet Explorer and Firefox, for example) it's still impossible to prevent selections that start before and end after the unselectable element without making the whole document unselectable.A JavaScript solution for Internet Explorer is:Until CSS 3's user-select property becomes available, Gecko-based browsers support the -moz-user-select property you already found. WebKit and Blink-based browsers support the -webkit-user-select property.This of course is not supported in browsers that do not use the Gecko rendering engine.There is no \"standards\" compliant quick-and-easy way to do it; using JavaScript is an option.The real question is, why do you want users to not be able to highlight and presumably copy and paste certain elements? I have not come across a single time that I wanted to not let users highlight a certain portion of my website. Several of my friends, after spending many hours reading and writing code will use the highlight feature as a way to remember where on the page they were, or providing a marker so that their eyes know where to look next.The only place I could see this being useful is if you have buttons for forms that should not be copy and pasted if a user copy and pasted the website.If you want to disable text selection on everything except on <p> elements, you can do this in CSS (watch out for the -moz-none which allows override in sub-elements, which is allowed in other browsers with none):In the solutions in previous answers selection is stopped, but the user still thinks you can select text because the cursor still changes. To keep it static, you'll have to set your CSS cursor:This will make your text totally flat, like it would be in a desktop application.You can do so in Firefox and Safari (Chrome also?)Workaround for WebKit:I found it in a CardFlip example.I like the hybrid CSS + jQuery solution.To make all elements inside <div class=\"draggable\"></div> unselectable, use this CSS:And then, if you're using jQuery, add this inside a $(document).ready() block:I figure you still want any input elements to be interactable, hence the :not() pseudo-selector. You could use '*' instead if you don't care.Caveat: Internet Explorer 9 may not need this extra jQuery piece, so you may want to add a version check in there.It's not the best way, though.You can use CSS or JavaScript for that.The JavaScript way is supported in older browsers, like old versions of Internet Explorer as well, but if it's not your case, use the CSS way then:HTML/JavaScript:HTML/CSS:For Internet Explorer in addition, you need to add pseudo class focus (.ClassName:focus) and outline-style: none.Try to insert these rows into the CSS and call the \"disHighlight\" at class property:A Quick Hack UpdateIf you use the value none for all the CSS user-select properties (including browser prefixes of it), there is a problem which can be still occurred by this.As CSS-Tricks says, the problem is:WebKit still allows the text to be copied, if you select elements around it.You can also use the below one to enforce that an entire element gets selected which means if you click on an element, all the text wrapped in that element will get selected. For this all you have to do is changing the value none to all.For those who have trouble achieving the same in the Android browser with the touch event, use:WorkingCSS:This should work, but it won't work for the old browsers. There is a browser compatibility issue.If you are using Less and Bootstrap you could write:Aside from the Mozilla-only property, no, there is no way to disable text selection with just standard CSS (as of now).If you notice, Stack Overflow doesn't disable text selection for their navigation buttons, and I would recommend against doing so in most cases, since it modifies normal selection behavior and makes it conflict with a user's expectations.This works in some browsers:Simply add your desired elements/ids in front of the selectors separated by commas without spaces, like so:The other answers are better; this should probably be seen as a last resort/catchall.Suppose there are two divs like this:Set cursor to default so that it will give a unselectable feel to the user.You can do this with a mixin:In an HTML tag:Try it in this CodePen.If you are using an autoprefixer you can remove other prefix.This will be useful if color selection is also not needed:...all other browser fixes. It will work in Internet Explorer 9 or later.Add this to the first div in which you want to disable the selection for text:NOTE:The correct answer is correct in that it prevents you from being able to select the text. However, it does not prevent you from being able to copy the text, as I'll show with the next couple of screenshots (as of 7th Nov 2014).As you can see, we were unable to select the numbers, but we were able to copy them.Tested on: Ubuntu, Google Chrome 38.0.2125.111.To get the result I needed, I found I had to use both ::selection and user-selectThis is not CSS, but it is worth a mention:jQuery UI Disable Selection:Check my solution without JavaScript:jsFiddlePopup menu with my technique applied: http://jsfiddle.net/y4Lac/2/Though this pseudo-element was in drafts of CSS Selectors Level 3, it was removed during the Candidate Recommendation phase, as it appeared that its behavior was under-specified, especially with nested elements, and interoperability wasn't achieved.It's being discussed in How ::selection works on nested elements.Despite it is being implemented in browsers, you can make an illusion of text not being selected by using the same color and background color on selection as of the tab design (in your case).Disallowing users to select the text will raise usability issues.It is easily done with:Alternatively:Let's say you have a <h1 id=\"example\">Hello, World!</h1>. You will have to remove the innerHTML of that h1, in this case Hello, World. Then you will have to go to CSS and do this:Now it simply thinks it is a block-element, and not text."},

Since it's all in one line, it's really the image you want aligned, not the text.Tested in FF3.Now you can use flexbox for this type of layout.Here are some simple techniques for vertical-align:This one is easy: set the line-height of the text element to equal that of the containerAbsolutely position an inner div relative to its containerIn order to get this to work correctly across the board, you'll have to hack the CSS a bit. Luckily, there is an IE bug that works in our favor. Setting top:50% on the container and top:-50% on the inner div, you can achieve the same result. We can combine the two using another feature IE doesn't support: advanced CSS selectors.This solution requires a slightly more modern browser than the other solutions, as it makes use of the transform: translateY property. (http://caniuse.com/#feat=transforms2d)Applying the following 3 lines of CSS to an element will vertically centre it within its parent regardless of the height of the parent element:Change your div into a flex container:\nNow there are two methods to center the alignments for all the content:Method 1:DEMO  Method 2:DEMO  Try different width and height values on the img and different font size values on the span and you'll see they always remain in the middle of the container.You have to apply vertical-align: middle to both elements to have it been centered perfectly.The accepted answer does center the icon around half of the x-height of the text next to it (as defined in the CSS specs). Which might be good enough but can look a little bit off, if the text has ascenders or descenders standing out just at top or bottom:On the left, the text is not aligned, on the right it is as shown above. A live demo can be found in this article about vertical-align.Has anyone talked about why vertical-align: top works in the scenario? The image in the question is probably taller than the text and thus defines the top edge of the line box. vertical-align: top on the span element then just positions it at the top of the line box. The main difference in behavior between vertical-align: middle and top is that the first moves elements relative to the box's baseline (which is placed wherever needed to fulfill all vertical alignments and thus feels rather unpredictable) and the second relative to the outer bounds of the line box (which is more tangible).The technique used in the accepted answer works only for single-lined text (demo), but not multi-line text (demo) - as noted there.If anyone needs to vertically center multi-lined text to an image, here are a few ways\n(Methods 1 and 2 inspired by this CSS-Tricks article)CSS:CSS:CSS (The above fiddle contains vendor prefixes):This code works in IE as well as FF:Because you have to set the line-height to the height of the div for this to workBasically, you'll have to get down to CSS3.For the record, alignment \"commands\" shouldn't work on a SPAN, because it is an in-line tag, not a block-level tag.  Things like alignment, margin, padding, etc won't work on an in-line tag because the point of inline is not to disrupt the text flow.CSS divides HTML tags up into two groups: in-line and block-level.  Search \"css block vs inline\" and a great article shows up...http://www.webdesignfromscratch.com/html-css/css-block-and-inline/(Understanding core CSS principles is a key to it not being quite so annoying)Use line-height:30px for the span so that text is align with the image:Another thing you can do is set the text's line-height to the size of the images within the <div>. Then set the images to vertical-align: middle;That's seriously the easiest way.Haven't seen a solution with margin in any of these answers yet, so here is my solution to this problem.This solution only works if you know the width of your image.I generally use 3px in place of top. By increasing/decreasing that value, the image can be changed to the required height.Write these span propertiesUse display:inline-block; When you use vertical-align property.Those are assosiated propertiesYou can set image as inline element using display propertyOn a button in jQuery mobile, for instance, you can tweak it a bit by applying this style to the image:Multiline solution:http://jsfiddle.net/zH58L/6/Works in all browers and ie9+It can be confusing, I agree.

In CSS2, shrink-to-fit is not a goal, but means to deal with a situation where browser \"has to\" get a width out of thin air. Those situations are: when there are no width specified. I heard they think of adding what you want in CSS3. For now, make do with one of the above.The decision not to expose the feature directly may seem strange, but there is a good reason. It is expensive. Shrink-to-fit means formatting at least twice: you cannot start formatting an element until you know its width, and you cannot calculate the width w/o going through entire content. Plus, one does not need shrink-to-fit element as often as one may think. Why do you need extra div around your table? Maybe table caption is all you need.I think usingwould work, however I'm not sure about the browser compatibility.Another solution would be to wrap your div in another div (if you want to maintain the block behavior):HTML:CSS:display: inline-block adds an extra margin to your element.I would recommend this:Bonus: You can also now easily center that fancy new #element just by adding margin: 0 auto.Foo Hack – Cross Browser Support for inline-block Styling (2007-11-19).You can try fit-content (CSS3): What works for me is:in the div. (Tested on Firefox and Google Chrome).There are two better solutions Out of these two display:table; is better, because display: inline-block; adds an extra margin.For display:inline-block; you can use the negative margin method to fix the extra spaceNot knowing in what context this will appear, but I believe the CSS-style property float either left or right will have this effect. On the other hand, it'll have other side effects as well, such as allowing text to float around it.Please correct me if I'm wrong though, I'm not 100% sure, and currently can't test it myself.The answer for your question lays in the future my friend ...namely \"intrinsic\" is coming with the latest CSS3 updateunfortunately IE is behind with it so it doesn't support it yet More about it: CSS Intrinsic & Extrinsic Sizing Module Level 3 and Can I Use?: Intrinsic & Extrinsic Sizing.

Just throwing this out there as another alternative idea if display: inline block isn't a suitable answer for you.We can use any of the two ways on the div element:   or,I prefer to use display: table;, because it handles, all extra spaces on its own.

However, this is causing it to simply appear, not transition,If I do it from height: 40px; to height: auto;, then it will slide up to height: 0;, and then suddenly jump to the correct height.How else could I do this without using JavaScript?Use max-height in the transition and not height. And set a value on max-height to something bigger than your box will ever get.See JSFiddle demo provided by Chris Jordan in another answer here.You should use scaleY instead.I've made a vendor prefixed version of the above code on jsfiddle,  and changed your jsfiddle to use scaleY instead of height.You can't currently animate on height when one of the heights involved is auto, you have to set two explicit heights.The solution that I've always used was to first fade out, then shrink the font-size, padding and margin values. It doesn't look the same as a wipe, but it works without a static height or max-height.Working example:I know this is the thirty-somethingth answer to this question, but I think it's worth it, so here goes. This is a CSS-only solution with the following properties:Here's a demo with three collapsible elements, all of different heights, that all use the same CSS. You might want to click \"full page\" after clicking \"run snippet\". Note that the JavaScript only toggles the collapsed CSS class, there's no measuring involved. (You could do this exact demo without any JavaScript at all by using a checkbox or :target). Also note that the part of the CSS that's responsible for the transition is pretty short, and the HTML only requires a single additional wrapper element.There are in fact two transitions involved in making this happen. One of them transitions the margin-bottom from 0px (in the expanded state) to -2000px in the collapsed state (similar to this answer). The 2000 here is the first magic number, it's based on the assumption that your box won't be higher than this (2000 pixels seems like a reasonable choice).Using the margin-bottom transition alone by itself has two issues:Fixing this second issue is where the second transition comes in, and this transition conceptually targets the wrapper's minimum height (\"conceptually\" because we're not actually using the min-height property for this; more on that later).Here's an animation that shows how combining the bottom margin transition with the minimum height transition, both of equal duration, gives us a combined transition from full height to zero height that has the same duration.The left bar shows how the negative bottom margin pushes the bottom upwards, reducing the visible height. The middle bar shows how the minimum height ensures that in the collapsing case, the transition doesn't end early, and in the expanding case, the transition doesn't start late. The right bar shows how the combination of the two causes the box to transition from full height to zero height in the correct amount of time.For my demo I've settled on 50px as the upper minimum height value. This is the second magic number, and it should be lower than the box' height would ever be. 50px seems reasonable as well; it seems unlikely that you'd very often want to make an element collapsible that isn't even 50 pixels high in the first place.As you can see in the animation, the resulting transition is continuous, but it is not differentiable -- at the moment when the minimum height is equal to the full height adjusted by the bottom margin, there is a sudden change in speed. This is very noticeable in the animation because it uses a linear timing function for both transitions, and because the whole transition is very slow. In the actual case (my demo at the top), the transition only takes 300ms, and the bottom margin transition is not linear. I've played around with a lot of different timing functions for both transitions, and the ones I ended up with felt like they worked best for the widest variety of cases.Two problems remain to fix:We solve the first problem by giving the container element a max-height: 0 in the collapsed case, with a 0s 0.3s transition. This means that it's not really a transition, but the max-height is applied with a delay; it only applies once the transition is over. For this to work correctly, we also need to pick a numerical max-height for the opposite, non-collapsed, state. But unlike in the 2000px case, where picking too large of a number affects the quality of the transition, in this case, it really doesn't matter. So we can just pick a number that is so high that we know that no height will ever come close to this. I picked a million pixels. If you feel you may need to support content of a height of more than a million pixels, then 1) I'm sorry, and 2) just add a couple of zeros.The second problem is the reason why we're not actually using min-height for the minimum height transition. Instead, there is an ::after pseudo-element in the container with a height that transitions from 50px to zero. This has the same effect as a min-height: It won't let the container shrink below whatever height the pseudo-element currently has. But because we're using height, not min-height, we can now use max-height (once again applied with a delay) to set the pseudo-element's actual height to zero once the transition is over, ensuring that at least outside the transition, even small elements have the correct height. Because min-height is stronger than max-height, this wouldn't work if we used the container's min-height instead of the pseudo-element's height. Just like the max-height in the previous paragraph, this max-height also needs a value for the opposite end of the transition. But in this case we can just pick the 50px.Tested in Chrome (Win, Mac, Android, iOS), Firefox (Win, Mac, Android), Edge, IE11 (except for a flexbox layout issue with my demo that I didn't bother debugging), and Safari (Mac, iOS). Speaking of flexbox, it should be possible to make this work without using any flexbox; in fact I think you could make almost everything work in IE7 – except for the fact that you won't have CSS transitions, making it a rather pointless exercise.You can, with a little bit of non-semantic jiggery-pokery. My usual approach is to animate the height of an outer DIV which has a single child which is a style-less DIV used only for measuring the content height.One would like to just be able to dispense with the .measuringWrapper and just set the DIV's height to auto and have that animate, but that doesn't seem to work (the height gets set, but no animation occurs).My interpretation is that an explicit height is needed for the animation to run. You can't get an animation on height when either height (the start or end height) is auto.A visual workaround to animating height using CSS3 transitions is to animate the padding instead. You don't quite get the full wipe effect, but playing around with the transition-duration and padding values should get you close enough. If you don't want to explicitly set height/max-height, this should be what you're looking for.http://jsfiddle.net/catharsis/n5XfG/17/ (riffed off stephband's above jsFiddle)My workaround is to transition max-height to the exact content height for a nice smooth animation, then use a transitionEnd callback to set max-height to 9999px so the content can resize freely.The accepted answer works for most cases, but it doesn't work well when your div can vary greatly in height — the animation speed is not dependent on the actual height of the content, and it can look choppy.You can still perform the actual animation with CSS, but you need to use JavaScript to compute the height of the items, instead of trying to use auto. No jQuery is required, although you may have to modify this a bit if you want compatibility (works in the latest version of Chrome :)).No hard coded values.No JavaScript.No approximations.The trick is to use a hidden & duplicated div to get the browser to understand what 100% means. This method is suitable whenever you're able to duplicate the DOM of the element you wish to animate. There was little mention of the Element.scrollHeight property which can be useful here and still may be used with a pure CSS transition. The property always contains the \"full\" height of an element, regardless of whether and how its content overflows as a result of collapsed height (e.g. height: 0).As such, for a height: 0 (effectively fully collapsed) element, its \"normal\" or \"full\" height is still readily available through its scrollHeight value (invariably a pixel length).For such an element, assuming it already has the transition set up like e.g. (using ul as per original question):We can trigger desired animated \"expansion\" of height, using CSS only, with something like the following (here assuming ul variable refers to the list):That's it. If you need to collapse the list, either of the two following statements will do:My particular use case revolved around animating lists of unknown and often considerable lengths, so I was not comfortable settling on an arbitrary \"large enough\" height or max-height specification and risking cut-off content or content that you suddenly need to scroll (if overflow: auto, for example). Additionally, the easing and timing is broken with max-height-based solutions, because the used height may reach its maximum value a lot sooner than it would take for max-height to reach 9999px. And as screen resolutions grow, pixel lengths like 9999px leave a bad taste in my mouth. This particular solution solves the problem in an elegant manner, in my opinion.Finally, here is hoping that future revisions of CSS address authors' need to do these kind of things even more elegantly -- revisit the notion of \"computed\" vs \"used\" and \"resolved\" values, and consider whether transitions should apply to computed values, including transitions with width and height (which currently get a bit of a special treatment).Use max-height with different transition easing and delay for each state. HTML:CSS:See example: http://jsfiddle.net/0hnjehjc/1/As I post this there are over 30 answers already, but I feel my answer improves on the already accepted answer by jake.I was not content with the issue that arises from simply using max-height and CSS3 transitions, since as many commenters noted, you have to set your max-height value very close to the actual height or you'll get a delay. See this JSFiddle for an example of that problem.To get around this (while still using no JavaScript), I added another HTML element that transitions the transform: translateY CSS value.This means both max-height and translateY are used: max-height allows the element to push down elements below it, while translateY gives the \"instant\" effect we want. The issue with max-height still exists, but its effect is lessened.\nThis means you can set a much larger height for your max-height value and worry about it less.The overall benefit is that on the transition back in (the collapse), the user sees the translateY animation immediately, so it doesn't really matter how long the max-height takes.Solution as FiddleOk, so I think I came up with a super simple answer...\nno max-height, uses relative positioning, works on li elements, & is pure CSS.\nI have not tested in anything but Firefox, though judging by the CSS, it should work on all browsers.FIDDLE: http://jsfiddle.net/n5XfG/2596/CSSHTMLEDIT: Scroll down for updated answer \nI was making a drop down list and saw this Post ... many different answers but I decide to share my drop down list too, ...

Edit: Improved JS Fiddle inspired by the Xbox One interface. JS FiddleI think I came up with a really solid solutionOK! I know this problem is as old as the internet but I think I have a solution which I turned into a plugin called mutant-transition. My solution sets the style=\"\" attributes for tracked elements whenever theres a change in the DOM. the end result is that you can use good ole CSS for your transitions and not use hacky fixes or special javascript. The only thing you have to do is set what you want to track on the element in question using data-mutant-attributes=\"X\". Thats it! This solution uses MutationObserver to follow changes in the DOM. Because of this, you don't really have to set anything up or use javascript to manually animate things. Changes are tracked automatically. However, because it uses MutationObserver, this will only transition in IE11+. \n\nFiddles!Expanding on @jake's answer, the transition will go all the way to the max height value, causing an extremely fast animation - if you set the transitions for both :hover and off you can then control the crazy speed a little bit more.So the li:hover is when the mouse enters the state and then the transition on the non-hovered property will be the mouse leave.Hopefully this will be of some help.e.g: Here's a fiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/BukwJ/Here's a way to transition from any starting height, including 0, to auto (full size and flexible) without requiring hard-set code on a per-node basis or any user-code to initialize: https://github.com/csuwildcat/transition-auto. This is basically the holy grail for what you want, I believe --> http://codepen.io/csuwldcat/pen/kwsdF. Just slap the following JS file into your page, and all you need to do after that is add/remove a single boolean attribute - reveal=\"\" - from the nodes you want to expand and contract.Here's all you need to do as the user, once you include the code block found below the example code:Here's the code block to include in your page, after that, it's all gravy:Drop this JS file in your page - it all Just Works™/* Code for height: auto; transitioning *//* Code for DEMO */Jake's answer to animate the max-height is great, but I found the delay caused by setting a large max-height annoying.One could move the collapsable content into an inner div and calculate the max height by getting the height of the inner div (via JQuery it'd be the outerHeight()).Here's a jsfiddle link: http://jsfiddle.net/pbatey/duZpTHere's a jsfiddle with the absolute minimal amount of code required: http://jsfiddle.net/8ncjjxh8/I realize this thread is getting old, but it ranks high on certain Google searches so I figure it's worth updating.You also just get/set the element's own height:You should dump this Javascript immediately after target_box's closing tag in an inline script tag.I was able to do this. I have a .child & a .parent div. The child div fits perfectly within the parent's width/height with absolute positioning. I then animate the translate property to push it's Y value down 100%. Its very smooth animation, no glitches or down sides like any other solution here.Something like this, pseudo codeYou would specify a height on .parent, in px, %, or leave as auto. This div then masks out the .child div when it slides down.Here's a solution I just used in combination with jQuery. This works for the following HTML structure:and the function:You could then use a click function to set and remove the height using css()CSS:I've recently been transitioning the max-height on the li elements rather than the wrapping ul.The reasoning is that the delay for small max-heights is far less noticeable (if at all) compared to large max-heights, and I can also set my max-height value relative to the font-size of the li rather than some arbitrary huge number by using ems or rems.If my font size is 1rem, I'll set my max-height to something like 3rem (to accommodate wrapped text). You can see an example here:http://codepen.io/mindfullsilence/pen/DtzjEI've met the requirements of no JS using Technique 2: transform: scaleY() of the article below.I posted an answer with some JavaScript and got downvoted, so got annoyed and tried again, and have cracked it with CSS only!This solution uses a few 'techniques':The upshot though is that we get performant transitioning using CSS only, and a single transition function to smoothly achieve the transition; the holy grail!Of course, there's a downside! I can't work out how to control the width at which content gets cut off (overflow:hidden); because of the padding-bottom hack, the width and height are intimately related.  There may be a way though, so will come back to it.https://jsfiddle.net/EoghanM/n1rp3zb4/28/I have not read everything in detail but I have had this problem recently and I did what follows:This allows you to have a div that at first shows content up to 200px height and on hover it's size becomes at least as high as the whole content of the div. The Div does not become 3000px but 3000px is the limit that I am imposing. Make sure to have the transition on the non :hover, otherwise you might get some strange rendering. In this way the :hover inherits from the non :hover. Transition does not work form px to % or to auto. You need to use same unit of measure.\nThis works fine for me. Using HTML5 makes it perfect....Remember that there is always a work around... ; )Hope someone finds this usefulThe max-height solution from Jake works well, if the hard-coded\nmax-height value supplied is not much bigger than the real height\n(because otherwise there are undesirable delays and timing problems).\nOn the other hand if the hard-coded value accidentially is \nnot bigger than the real height the element won't open up completely.The following CSS only solution also requires a hard-coded size that\nshould be bigger than most of the occurring real sizes.  However this\nsolution also works if the real size is in some situations bigger than\nthe hard-coded size. In that event the transition might jump a bit,\nbut it will never leave a partially visible element.\nSo this solution could also be used for unknown content, e.g. from\na database, where you just know that the content is usually not bigger\nthan x pixels, but there are exceptions.Idea is to use a negative value for margin-bottom (or margin-top for a\nslightly diffenrent animation) and to place the content element into a\nmiddle element with overflow:hidden. The negative margin of the content\nelement so reduces the height of the middle element.The following code uses a transition on margin-bottom from -150px to\n0px.  This alone works fine as long as the content element is not\nhigher than 150px. In addition it uses a transition on max-height for the\nmiddle element from 0px to 100%.  This finally hides the middle element\nif the content element is higher than 150px.\nFor max-height the transition is just used to delay its application\nby a second when closing, not for a smooth visiual effect (\nand therefore it can run from  0px to 100%).CSS:HTML:The value for margin bottom should be negative and as close as\npossible to the real height of the content element. If it('s absoute\nvalue) is bigger there are similar delay and timing problems as with\nthe max-height solutions, which however can be limited as long as the\nhard coded size is not much bigger than the real one. If the absolute\nvalue for margin-bottom is smaller than the real height the \ntansition jumps a bit. In any case after the transition the\ncontent element is either fully displayed or fully removed.For more details see my blog post http://www.taccgl.org/blog/css_transition_display.html#combined_heightThis isn't exactly a \"solution\" to the problem, but more of a workaround. It only works as written with text, but can be changed to work with other elements as needed I'm sure.Here is an example: http://codepen.io/overthemike/pen/wzjRKaEssentially, you set the font-size to 0 and transition that instead of the height, or max-height, or scaleY() etc. at a quick enough pace to get the height to transform to what you want. To transform the actual height with CSS to auto isn't currently possible, but transforming the content within is, hence the font-size transition."},

I've tried height:100%, min-height:100%;, etc.There are a couple of CSS 3 measurement units called:From the linked W3 Candidate Recommendation above:These units are vh (viewport height), vw (viewport width), vmin (viewport minimum length) and vmax (viewport maximum length).For this question, we can make use of vh: 1vh is equal to 1% of the viewport's height. That is to say, 100vh is equal to the height of the browser window, regardless of where the element is situated in the DOM tree:This is literally all that's needed. Here is a JSFiddle example of this in use.This is currently supported on all up-to-date major browsers apart from Opera Mini. Check out Can I use... for further support.In the case of the question at hand, featuring a left and a right divider, here is a JSFiddle example showing a two-column layout involving both vh and vw.Take this layout for example:The p tag here is set to 100% height, but because its containing div has 200 pixels height, 100% of 200 pixels becomes 200 pixels, not 100% of the body height. Using 100vh instead means that the p tag will be 100% height of the body regardless of the div height. Take a look at this accompanying JSFiddle to easily see the difference!If you want to set the height of a <div> or any element, you should set the height of <body> and <html> to 100% too. Then you can set the height of element with 100% :)Here is an example:If you’re able to absolutely position your elements,would do it.You can use the view-port unit in CSS:HTML:CSS:You can use vh in this case which is relative to 1% of the height of the viewport...That means if you want to cover off the height, just simply use 100vh.Look at the image below I draw for you here:Try the snippet I created for you as below:All the other solutions, including the top-voted one with vh are sub-optimal when compared to the flex model solution.With the advent of the CSS flex model, solving the 100% height problem becomes very, very easy: use height: 100%; display: flex on the parent, and flex: 1 on the child elements. They'll automatically take up all the available space in their container.Note how simple the markup and the CSS are. No table hacks or anything.The flex model is supported by all major browsers as well as IE11+.Learn more about the flex model here.You don't mention a few important details like:Here's one possibility:There are many variations on this depending on which columns need to be fixed and which are liquid. You can do this with absolute positioning too but I've generally found better results (particularly in terms of cross-browser) using floats instead.This is what worked for me:Use position:fixed instead of position:absolute, that way even if you scroll down the division will expand to the end of the screen.Here's a fix for the height.In your CSS use:For browser that don't support vh-units, use modernizr.Add this script (to add detection for vh-units)Finally use this function to add the height of the viewport to #your-object if the browser doesn't support vh-units:100% works differently for width and height.When you specify width: 100%, it means \"take up 100% of the available width from the parent element or width of the window.\"When you specify height: 100%, it only means \"take up 100% of available height from the parent element.\" This means if you don't specify a height at a top level element, the height of all the children will be either 0 or height of the parent, and that is why you need to set the topmost element to have a min-height of window height.I always specify the body to have a min-height of 100vh and it makes positioning and calculations easy,Add min-height: 100% and don't specify a height (or put it on auto). It totally did the job for me:100vw === 100% of the width of the viewport.100vh === 100% of the height of the viewport.If you want to set the div width or height 100% of browser-window-size you should use:For width: 100vwFor height: 100vhOr if you want to set it smaller size, use the CSS calc function. Example:There are several methods available for setting the height of a <div> to 100%.Method (A):Method (B) using vh:Method (c) using flex box:This worked for me:Taken from this page.Try to set height:100% in html & body And if you want to 2 div height same use or set the parent element display:flex property.Simplest way is to do it like this.Just use the \"vh\" unit instead of \"px\", which means view-port height. Block elements consume the full width of their parent, by default.This is how they meet their design requirement, which is to stack vertically.This behavior, however, does not extend to height.By default, most elements are the height of their content (height: auto).Unlike with width, you need to specify a height if you want extra space.Therefore, keep these two things in mind:Here is something that is not exactly like what you had in previous answers, but it could be helpful to some:https://jsfiddle.net/newdark/qyxkk558/10/Use FlexBox CSSFlexbox is a perfect fit for this type of problem. While mostly known for laying out content in the horizontal direction, Flexbox actually works just as well for vertical layout problems. All you have to do is wrap the vertical sections in a flex container and choose which ones you want to expand. They’ll automatically take up all the available space in their container.One of the options is using CSS table. It has great browser support and even works in Internet Explorer 8.JSFiddle ExampleTry this - tested:You can use display: flex and height: 100vhYou need to do two things, one is to set the height to 100% which you already did. Second is set the position to absolute. That should do the trick.SourceTry the following CSS:Actually what worked for me best was using the vh property.In my React application I wanted the div to match the page high even when resized. I tried height: 100%;, overflow-y: auto;, but none of them worked when setting height:(your percent)vh; it worked as intended.Note: if you are using padding, round corners, etc., make sure to subtract those values from your vh property percent or it adds extra height and make scroll bars appear. Here's my sample:If you use position: absolute; and jQuery, you could useYou have to set up only height:100%."},

This solution will work for a single line and multiple lines of text, but it still requires a fixed height container:The CSS just sizes the <div>, vertically center aligns the <span> by setting the <div>'s line-height equal to its height, and makes the <span> an inline-block with vertical-align: middle. Then it sets the line-height back to normal for the <span>, so its contents will flow naturally inside the block.And here is another option, which may not work on older browsers that don't support display: table and display: table-cell (basically just Internet Explorer 7). Using CSS we simulate table behavior (since tables support vertical alignment), and the HTML is the same as the second example:This technique uses an absolutely positioned element setting top, bottom, left and right to 0. It is described in more detail in an article in Smashing Magazine, Absolute Horizontal And Vertical Centering In CSS.Another way (not mentioned here yet) is with Flexbox.Just add the following code to the container element:Alternatively, instead of aligning the content via the container, flexbox can also center the a flex item with an auto margin when there is only one flex-item in the flex container (like the example given in the question above).So to center the flex item both horizontally and vertically just set it with margin:autoNB: All the above applies to centering items while laying them out in horizontal rows. This is also the default behavior, because by default the value for flex-direction is row. If, however flex-items need to be laid out in vertical columns, then flex-direction: column should be set on the container to set the main-axis as column and additionally the justify-content and align-items properties now work the other way around with justify-content: center centering vertically and  align-items: center centering horizontally)A good place to start with Flexbox to see some of its features and get syntax for maximum browser support is flexyboxes Also, browser support nowadays is very good: caniuseFor cross-browser compatibility for display: flex and align-items, you can use the following:You can easily do this by adding the following piece of CSS code:That means your CSS finally looks like:For reference and to add a simpler answer:Pure CSS:Or as a SASS/SCSS Mixin:Use by:By Sebastian Ekström's blog post Vertical align anything with just 3 lines of CSS:This method can cause elements to be blurry due to the element being placed on a “half pixel”. A solution for this is to set its parent element to preserve-3d. Like following:We live in 2015+ and Flex Box is supported by every major modern browser.It will be the way websites are made from here on out.Learn it!All credit goes to this link owner @Sebastian Ekström Link; please go through this. See it in action codepen. By reading the above article I also created a demo fiddle.With just three lines of CSS (excluding vendor prefixes) we can do it with the help of a transform: translateY vertically centers whatever we want, even if we don’t know its height.The CSS property transform is usually used for rotating and scaling elements, but with its translateY function we can now vertically align elements. Usually this must be done with absolute positioning or setting line-heights, but these require you to either know the height of the element or only works on single-line text, etc.So, to do this we write:That’s all you need. It is a similar technique to the absolute-position method, but with the upside that we don’t have to set any height on the element or position-property on the parent. It works straight out of the box, even in Internet Explorer 9!To make it even more simple, we can write it as a mixin with its vendor prefixes.Flexboxes that were introduced in CSS3 are the solution:Tip: Replace the line above which is marked as \"Key Part\" with one of these lines, if you want to center the text:1) Only vertically:2) Only horizontally:As I noticed, this trick works with grids (i.e. display: grid), also.Flexible approachThe solution accepted as the answer is perfect to use line-height the same as the height of div, but this solution does not work perfectly when text is wrapped OR is in two lines.Try this one if text is wrapped or is on multiple lines inside a div.For more reference, see:Try this solution:Built using CSS+.You can use the following code snippet as the reference. It is working like a charm for me:The output of the above code snippet is as follow:You can also use below properties.Another way:Don't set the height attribute of the div, but instead use padding: to achieve the effect. Similarly to line-height, it only works if you have one line of text.  Although this way, if you have more content, the text will still be centered, but the div itself will be slightly larger.So instead of going with:You can say:This will set the top and bottom padding of the div to 60px, and the left and right padding to zero, making the div 120 pixels (plus the height of your font) high, and placing the text vertically centered in the div.Here is another option using flexbox.I saw the previous answers, and they will work only for that width of screen (not responsive). For the responsive you have to use flex.Example:I'm not sure anyone has gone the writing-mode route, but I think it solves the problem cleanly and has broad support:This will, of course, work with any dimensions you need (besides 100% of the parent). If you uncomment the border lines, it'll be helpful to familiarize yourself.JSFiddle demo for you to fiddle.Caniuse support: 85.22% + 6.26% = 91.48% (even Internet Explorer is in!)For all your vertical alignment needs!Declare this Mixin:Then include it in your element:Even better idea for this. You can do like this too For a single line of text (or a single character) you can use this technique:It can be used when #box has a non-fixed, relative height in %.<div id=\"box\"></div>See a live demo at JsBin (easier to edit CSS) or JsFiddle (easier to change height of result frame).If you want to place inner text in HTML, not in CSS, then you need to wrap text content in additional inline element and edit #box::after to match it. (And, of course, content: property should be removed.)For example,\n<div id=\"box\"><span>TextContent</span></div>.\nIn this case, #box::after should be replaced with #box span.For Internet Explorer 8 support you must replace :: with :.Try the transform property:The simple and versatile way is (as Michielvoo's\ntable approach):Using this attribute (or a equivalent class) on a parent tag works even for many children to align:A very simple & most powerful solution to vertically align center:The following code will put the div in the middle of the screen regardless of screen size or div size:See more details about flex here. Try the following code:I would just like to extend the answer from Michielvoo in order to release need for line-height and breathing of div height. It is basically just a simplified version like this:NOTE: commented out part of cssis needed for fixed-height of enclosing div.I needed a row of clickable elephants, vertically centered, but without using a table to get around some Internet Explorer 9 weirdness.I eventually found the nicest CSS (for my needs) and it's great with Firefox, Chrome, and Internet Explorer 11. Sadly Internet Explorer 9 is still laughing at me...Obviously you don't need the borders, but they can help you see how it works.You can use the positioning method in CSS:Check the result here.... HTML:CSS:Hope you use this method too.Set it within button instead of div if you don't care about its little visual 3D effect.This is easy and very short:Absolute Positioning and StretchingAs with the method above this one begins by setting positioning on the parent and child elements as relative and absolute respectively. From there things differ.In the code below I’ve once again used this method to center the child both horizontally and vertically, though you can use the method for vertical centering only.HTMLCSSThe idea with this method is to try to get the child element to stretch to all four edges by setting the top, bottom, right, and left vales to 0. Because our child element is smaller than our parent elements it can’t reach all four edges.Setting auto as the margin on all four sides however causes opposite margins to be equal and displays our child div in the center of the parent div.Unfortunately the above won’t work in Internet Explorer 7 and below, and like the previous method the content inside the child div can grow too large, causing it to be hidden.Add this small code in the CSS property of your element. It is awesome. Try it!"},

I want to know, what the best we can do with CSS only.I found similar questions on Stack Overflow.And this one on Doctype.com.Here are three solutions:Solution #1 - appearance: none   - with Internet Explorer 10 - 11 workaround (Demo)--To hide the default arrow set appearance: none on the select element, then add your own custom arrow with background-imageBrowser Support:appearance: none has very good browser support (caniuse) - except for Internet Explorer 11 (and later) and Firefox 34 (and later).We can improve this technique and add support for Internet Explorer 10 and Internet Explorer 11 by addingIf Internet Explorer 9 is a concern, we have no way of removing the default arrow (which would mean that we would now have two arrows), but, we could use a funky Internet Explorer 9 selector.To at least undo our custom arrow - leaving the default select arrow intact.This solution is easy and has good browser support - it should generally suffice.If browser support for Internet Explorer 9 (and later) and Firefox 34  (and later) is necessary then keep reading...Solution #2 Truncate the select element to hide the default arrow (demo)--(Read more here)Wrap the select element in a div with a fixed width and overflow:hidden.Then give the select element a width of about 20 pixels greater than the div.The result is that the default drop-down arrow of the select element will be hidden (due to the overflow:hidden on the container), and you can place any background image you want on the right-hand-side of the div.The advantage of this approach is that it is cross-browser (Internet Explorer 8 and later, WebKit, and Gecko). However, the disadvantage of this approach is that the options drop-down juts out on the right-hand-side (by the 20 pixels which we hid... because the option elements take the width of the select element).[It should be noted, however, that if the custom select element is necessary only for mobile devices - then the above problem doesn't apply - because of the way each phone natively opens the select element. So for mobile, this may be the best solution.]If the custom arrow is necessary on Firefox - prior to Version 35 - but you don't need to support old versions of Internet Explorer - then keep reading...Solution #3 - Use the pointer-events property (demo)--(Read more here)The idea here is to overlay an element over the native drop down arrow (to create our custom one) and then disallow pointer events on it.Advantage: It works well in WebKit and Gecko. It looks good too (no jutting out option elements).Disadvantage: Internet Explorer (Internet Explorer 10 and down) doesn't support pointer-events, which means you can't click the custom arrow. Also, another (obvious) disadvantage with this method is that you can't target your new arrow image with a hover effect or hand cursor, because we have just disabled pointer events on them!However, with this method you can use Modernizer or conditional comments to make Internet Explorer revert to the standard built in arrow.NB: Being that Internet Explorer 10 doesn't support conditional comments anymore: If you want to use this approach, you should probably use Modernizr. However, it is still possible to exclude the pointer-events CSS from Internet Explorer 10 with a CSS hack described here.It is possible, but unfortunately mostly in WebKit-based browsers to the extent we, as developers, require. Here is the example of CSS styling gathered from Chrome options panel via built-in developer tools inspector, improved to match currently supported CSS properties in most modern browsers:When you run this code on any page within a WebKit-based browser it should change the appearance of the select box, remove standard OS-arrow and add a PNG-arrow, put some spacing before and after the label, almost anything you want.The most important part is appearance property, which changes how the element behaves.It works perfectly in almost all WebKit-based browser, including mobile ones, though Gecko doesn't support appearance as well as WebKit, it seems.The select element and its dropdown feature are difficult to style.style attributes for select element by Chris Heilmann confirms what Ryan Dohery said in a comment to the first answer:The largest inconsistency I've noticed when styling select dropdowns is Safari and Google Chrome rendering (Firefox is fully customizable through CSS). After some searching through obscure depths of the Internet I came across the following, which nearly completely resolves my qualms with WebKit:Safari and Google Chrome fix:This does, however, remove the dropdown arrow. You can add a dropdown arrow using a nearby div with a background, negative margin or absolutely positioned over the select dropdown.*More information and other variables are available in CSS property: -webkit-appearance.I had this exact problem, except I couldn't use images and was not limited by browser support. This should be «on spec» and with luck start working everywhere eventually.It uses layered rotated background layers to «cut out» a dropdown arrow, as pseudo-elements wouldn't work for the select element.Edit: In this updated version I am using CSS variables and a tiny theming system.<select> tags can be styled through CSS just like any other HTML element on an HTML page rendered in a browser. Below is an (overly simple) example that will position a select element on the page and render the text of the options in blue.Example HTML file (selectExample.html):Example CSS file (selectExample.css):The blog post How to CSS form drop down style no JavaScript works for me, but it fails in Opera though:Here is a version that works in all modern browsers. The key is using appearance:none which removes the default formatting. Since all of the formatting is gone, you have to add back in the arrow that visually differentiates the select from the input.Working example: https://jsfiddle.net/gs2q1c7p/I got to your case using Bootstrap. This is the simplest solution that works:Note: the base64 stuff is fa-chevron-down in SVG.In modern browsers it's relatively painless to style the <select> in CSS. With appearance: none the only tricky part is replacing the arrow (if that's what you want). Here's a solution that uses an inline data: URI with plain-text SVG:The rest of the styling (borders, padding, colors, etc.) is fairly straightforward.This works in all the browsers I just tried (Firefox 50, Chrome 55, Edge 38, and Safari 10). One note about Firefox is that if you want to use the # character in the data URI (e.g. fill: #000) you need to escape it (fill: %23000).Use the clip property to crop the borders and the arrow of the select element, then add your own replacement styles to the wrapper:Use a second select with zero opacity to make the button clickable:Coordinates differ between Webkit and other browsers, but a @media query can cover that.ReferencesEdit this element is not recommended, but if you want to try it's like any other HTML element.Edit example:Tested in Internet Explorer (10 and 11), Edge, Firefox, and ChromeThis uses a background color for select elements and I removed the image..A very nice example that uses :after and :before to do the trick is in Styling Select Box with CSS3 | CSSDeckYes.  You may style any HTML element by its tag name, like this:Of course, you can also use a CSS class to style it, like any other element:Here's a solution based on my favorite ideas from this discussion. This allows styling a <select> element directly without any additional markup.It works Internet Explorer 10 (and later) with a safe fallback for Internet Explorer 8/9. One caveat for these browsers is that the background image must be positioned and be small enough to hide behind the native expand control.http://codepen.io/ralgh/pen/gpgbGxAs of Internet Explorer 10, you can use the ::-ms-expand pseudo element selector to style, and hide, the drop down arrow element. The remaining styling should be similar to other browsers.Here is a basic fork of Danield's jsfiddle that applies support for IE10Check this fiddle, and forgive me the overstyling: https://jsfiddle.net/dkellner/7ac9us70/The trick behind: as soon as the <select> tag gets a property called \"size\", it will behave as a fixed-height list, and, suddenly, for some reason, allows you to style the hell out of it. Now strictly speaking, the fixed list is a side effect - but it just helps us more because we use it for the \"dropped-down look\".A minimal example:(to keep it simple I did it with jQuery - but you can do the same without it)\nYou definitely should do it like in Styling select, optgroup and options with CSS. In many ways, background-color and color are just what you would typically need to style options, not the entire select.You can also add a hover style to the dropdown.The third method in Danield's answer can be improved to work with hover-effects and other mouse events. Just make sure that the \"button\"-element comes right after the select element in the markup. Then target it using the + CSS selector:This will, however, show the hover effect when hovering anywhere over the select-element, not just over the \"button\".I'm using this method in combination with Angular (since my project happens to be an Angular application anyway), to cover the whole select-element, and let Angular display the text of the selected option in the \"button\"-element. In this case it makes perfect sense that the hover-effect applies when hovering anywhere over the select.It doesn't work without JavaScript though, so if you want to do this, and your site has to work without JavaScript, you should make sure that your script adds the elements and classes necessary for the enhancement. That way, a browser without JavaScript will simply get a normal, unstyled, select, instead of a styled badge that doesn't update correctly.A CSS and HTML only solutionIt seems compatible with Chrome, Firefox, and Internet Explorer 11. But please leave your feedback regarding other web browsers.As suggested by Danield's answer, I wrap my select in a div (even two divs for x-browser compatibility) to get the expected behavior.See http://jsfiddle.net/bjap2/HTML:Notice the two div wrappers.Also notice the extra div added to place the arrow-down button wherever you like (positioned absolutely), here we put it on the left."},

A previous sibling selector is born (or at least simulated).Here's the full code:From the flexbox spec:The initial order value for all flex items is 0.Also see order in the CSS Grid Layout spec.Examples of \"previous sibling selectors\" created with the flex order property.Flexbox is shattering long-held beliefs about CSS.One such belief is that a previous sibling selector is not possible in CSS.To say this belief is widespread would be an understatement. Here's a sampling of related questions on Stack Overflow alone:As described above, this belief is not entirely true. A previous sibling selector can be simulated in CSS using the flex order property.The z-index MythAnother long-standing belief has been that z-index works only on positioned elements.In fact, the most current version of the spec – the W3C Editor's Draft – still asserts this to be true:In reality, however, this information is obsolete and inaccurate.Elements that are flex items or grid items can create stacking contexts even when position is static.Here's a demonstration of z-index working on non-positioned flex items: https://jsfiddle.net/m0wddwxs/I had the same question, but then I had a \"duh\" moment.   Instead of writingwrite Obviously this matches \"x\" instead of \"y\", but it answers the \"is there a match?\" question, and simple DOM traversal may get you to the right element more efficiently than looping in javascript.I realize that the original question was a CSS question so this answer is probably completely irrelevant, but other Javascript users may stumble on the question via search like I did.Two tricks.

Remember that it is experimental and it has some limitation ...\n(check this link if you worries about navigator compatibility )What you can do is use a CSS3 selector : the pseudo classe called nth-child()If you know the exact position an :nth-child()-based exclusion of all following siblings would work.Which would select all lis before the 3rd (e.g. 1st and 2nd). But, in my opinion this looks ugly and has a very tight usecase.You also could select the nth-child right-to-left:Which does the same.There is no \"previous\" sibling selector unfortunately, but you can possibly still get the same effect by using positioning (e.g. float right). It depends on what you are trying to do.In my case, I wanted a primarily CSS 5-star rating system. I would need to color (or swap the icon of) the previous stars. By floating each element right, I am essentially getting the same effect (the html for the stars thus must be written 'backwards').I'm using FontAwesome in this example and swapping between the unicodes of fa-star-o and fa-star\nhttp://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/CSS:HTML:\n    \n        \n             \n             \n             \n             \n             \n        \n        (40)\n    JSFiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/andrewleyva/88j0105g/No. It is not possible via CSS. It takes the \"Cascade\" to heart ;-).However, if you are able to add JavaScript to your page, a little bit of jQuery could get you to your end goal.\nYou can use jQuery's find to perform a \"look-ahead\" on your target element/class/id, then backtrack to select your target.\nThen you use jQuery to re-write the DOM (CSS) for your element.Based on this answer by Mike Brant,\nthe following jQuery snippet could help.This first selects all <ul>s that immediately follow a <p>.\nThen it \"backtracks\" to select all the previous <p>s from that set of <ul>s.Effectively, \"previous sibling\" has been selected via jQuery.\nNow, use the .css function to pass in your CSS new values for that element.In my case I was looking to find a way to select a DIV with the id #full-width, but ONLY if it had a (indirect) descendant DIV with the class of .companies.I had control of all the HTML under .companies, but could not alter any of the HTML above it.\nAnd the cascade goes only 1 direction: down.Thus I could select ALL #full-widths.\nOr I could select .companies that only followed a #full-width.\nBut I could not select only #full-widths that proceeded .companies.And, again, I was unable to add .companies any higher up in the HTML.  That part of the HTML was written externally, and wrapped our code.But with jQuery, I can select the required #full-widths, then assign the appropriate style:  This finds all #full-width .companies, and selects just those .companies, similar to how selectors are used to target specific elements in standard in CSS.\nThen it uses .parents to \"backtrack\" and select ALL parents of .companies,\nbut filters those results to keep only #fill-width elements, so that in the end,\nit only selects a #full-width element if it has a .companies class descendant.\nFinally, it assigns a new CSS (width) value to the resulting element.jQuery Reference Docs:\n$() or jQuery(): DOM element.\n.find: Get the descendants of each element in the current set of matched elements, filtered by a selector, jQuery object, or element.\n.parents: Get the immediately preceding sibling of each element in the set of matched elements. If a selector is provided, it retrieves the previous sibling only if it matches that selector (filters the results to only include the listed elements/selectors).\n.css: Set one or more CSS properties for the set of matched elements.   Depending on your exact objective, there is a way to achieve the usefulness of a parent selector without using one (even if one were to exist)...Say we have:What can we do to make the Socks block (including sock colours) stand out visually using spacing?What would be nice but doesn't exist:What does exist:This sets all anchor links to have 15px margin on the top and resets it back to 0 for those with no UL elements (or other tags) inside LIs.I needed a solution to select the previous sibling tr. I came up with this solution using React and Styled-components. This is not my exact solution (This is from memory, hours later). I know there is a flaw in the setHighlighterRow function.OnMouseOver a row will set the row index to state, and rerender the previous row with a new background color I had a similar problem and found out that all problem of this nature can be solved as follows:and this way you'll be able to style your current, previous items(all items overridden with current and next items) and your next items.example:Hope it helps someone.This is what I used by using jQueryThis is how will get the working codes:"},

Also unfortunately, you'll need to use additional divs around the div you want vertically centered.For standards-compliant browsers like Mozilla, Opera, Safari, etc. you need to set the outer div to be displayed as a table and the inner div to be displayed as a table-cell — which can then be vertically centered. For Internet Explorer, you need to position the inner div absolutely within the outer div and then specify the top as 50%.

For example, you may attempt to try something like this:But that will not work. From my experience, I have found this to do nothing.Because of this, you will always need to keep the element display: block - but you could get around it by doing something like this:At the time of this post all major browsers disable CSS transitions if you try to change the display property, but CSS animations still work fine so we can use them as a workaround.Example Code (you can apply it to your menu accordingly) Demo:Add the following CSS to your stylesheet:Then apply the fadeIn animation to the child on parent hover (and of course set display: block):(Some JavaScript code is required)I suspect that the reason that transitions are disabled if display is changed is because of what display actually does. It does not change anything that could conceivably be smoothly animated.display: none; and visibility: hidden; are two entirely different things.\nBoth do have the effect of making the element invisible, but with visibility: hidden; it’s still rendered in the layout, but just not visibly so.\nThe hidden element still takes up space, and is still rendered inline or as a block or block-inline or table or whatever the display element tells it to render as, and takes up space accordingly.\nOther elements do not automatically move to occupy that space. The hidden element just doesn’t render its actual pixels to the output.display: none on the other hand actually prevents the element from rendering entirely.\nIt does not take up any layout space.\nOther elements that would’ve occupied some or all of the space taken up by this element now adjust to occupy that space, as if the element simply did not exist at all.display is not just another visual attribute.\nIt establishes the entire rendering mode of the element, such as whether it’s a block, inline, inline-block, table, table-row, table-cell, list-item, or whatever!\nEach of those have very different layout ramifications, and there would be no reasonable way to animate or smoothly transition them (try to imagine a smooth transition from block to inline or vice-versa, for instance!).This is why transitions are disabled if display changes (even if the change is to or from none — none isn’t merely invisibility, it’s its own element rendering mode that means no rendering at all!).display is not one of the properties that transition works upon.See Animatable CSS properties for the list of CSS properties that can have transitions applied to them. See CSS Values and Units Module Level 4, Combining Values: Interpolation, Addition, and Accumulation for how they are interpolated.Up to CSS 3 was listed in 9.1. Properties from CSS (just close the warning popup)Last time I had to do this, I used max-height instead, which is an animatable property (although it was a bit of a hack, it did work), but beware that it may be very janky for complex pages or users with low-end mobile devices.Instead of callbacks, which don't exist in CSS, we can use transition-delay property.So, what's going on here?Note, this approach is better than ones using visibility. In such cases, the element still occupies the space on the page, and it's not always suitable.For more examples please refer to this article.You can add a custom animation to the block property now.DemoIn this demo the sub-menu changes from display:none to display:block and still manages to fade.According to W3C Working Draft 19 November 2013 display is not an animatable property. Fortunately, visibility is animatable. You may chain its transition with a transition of opacity (JSFiddle):Note that if you just make the link transparent, without setting visibility: hidden, then it would stay clickable.My neat JavaScript trick is to separate the entire scenario into two different functions!To prepare things, one global variable is declared and one event handler is defined:Then, when hiding element, I use something like this: For reappearing the element, I am doing something like this:It works, so far!Edit: display none is not being applied in this example.What's happening above is that through 99% of the animation display is set to block while the opacity fades out. In the last moment display property is set to none.And the most important bit is to retain the last frame after the animation ends using animation-fill-mode: forwardsHere are two examples: https://jsfiddle.net/qwnz9tqg/3/I ran into this today, with a position: fixed modal that I was reusing. I couldn't keep it display: none and then animate it, as it just jumped into appearance, and and z-index (negative values, etc) did weird things as well.I was also using a height: 0 to height: 100%, but it only worked when the modal appeared. This is the same as if you used left: -100% or something.Then it struck me that there was a simple answer. Et voila:First, your hidden modal. Notice the height is 0, and check out the height declaration in transitions... it has a 500ms, which is longer than my opacity transition. Remember, this affects the out-going fade-out transition: returning the modal to its default state.Second, your visible modal. Say you're setting a .modal-active to the body. Now the height is 100%, and my transition has also changed. I want the height to be instantly changed, and the opacity to take 300ms.That's it, it works like a charm.Taking from a few of these answers and some suggestions elsewhere, the following works great for hover menus (I'm using this with Bootstrap 3, specifically):You could also use height in place of max-height if you specify both values since height:auto is not allowed with transitions. The hover value of max-height needs to be greater than the height of the menu can possibly be.I've came across this issue multiple times and now simply went with:By adding the class block--invisible the whole Elements will not be clickable but all Elements behind it will be because of the pointer-events:none which is supported by all major browsers (no IE < 11).Change overflow:hidden to overflow:visible. It works better. I use like this:visible is better because overflow:hidden act exactly like a display:none.JavaScript is not required, and no outrageously huge max-height is needed. Instead, set your max-height on your text elements, and use a font relative unit such as rem or em. This way, you can set a maximum height larger than your container, while avoiding a delay or \"popping\" when the menu closes:HTMLCSSSee an example here:\nhttp://codepen.io/mindfullsilence/pen/DtzjEAfter the accepted answer from Guillermo was written, the CSS\ntransition specification of 2012-04-03 changed the behavior of the visibility transition and now it is possible to solve this problem in a shorter way, without the use of transition-delay:The run time specified for both transitions should usually be\nidentical (although a slightly longer time for visibility is not a problem).For a running version, see my blog post CSS Transition Visibility.W.r.t. the title of the question \"Transitions on the display: property\" and in response to comments from Rui Marques and josh to the accepted answer:This solution works in cases where it is irrelevant if the display or\nvisibility property is used (as it probably was the case in this question).It will not completely remove the element as display:none, just make it invisible, but it still stays in the document flow and influences the position of the following elements.Transitions that completely remove the element similar to display:none can be done using height (as indicated by other answers and comments), max-height, or margin-top/bottom, but also see\nHow can I transition height: 0; to height: auto; using CSS? and my blog post Workarounds for CSS Transitions on the Display and Height Properties.In response to comment from GeorgeMillo:\nBoth properties and both transitions are needed: The opacity property\nis used to create a fade-in and fade-out animation and the visibility\nproperty to avoid the element still reacting on mouse\nevents. Transitions are needed on opacity for the visual effect and on\nvisibility to delay hiding until the fade-out is finished.I finally found a solution for me, by combining opacity with position absolute (not to occupy space when hidden).I suspect anyone just starting CSS transitions quickly discovers that they don't work if you're modifying the display property (block/none) at the same time. One workaround that hasn't yet been mentioned is that you can continue to use display:block/none to hide/show the element, but set its opacity to 0 so that even when it's display:block, it's still invisible.Then to fade it in, add another CSS class such as \"on\" which sets the opacity to 1 and defines the transition for opacity. As you may have imagined, you'll have to use JavaScript to add that \"on\" class to the element, but at least you're still using CSS for the actual transition.P.S. If you find yourself in a situation where you need to do both display:block, and add class \"on\", at the same time, defer the latter using setTimeout. Otherwise, the browser just sees both things as happening at once and disables the transition.It is as simple as the following :)Get it to fade away, and then make it height 0;. Also make sure to use forwards so that it stays in the final state.I found better way for this issue, you can use CSS Animation and make your awesome effect for showing items.This solution has excellent compatibility, and I haven't seen it yet:Explanation: it uses the visibility: hidden trick (which is compatible with “show-and-animate” in one step), but it uses the combination position: absolute; z-index: -1; pointer-events: none; to make sure that the hidden container does not take space and does not answer to user interactions.You can get this to work the natural way you expected - using display - but you have to throttle the browser to get it to work, using either Javascript or as others have suggested a fancy trick with one tag inside another. I don't care for the inner tag as it further complicates CSS and dimensions, so here's the Javascript solution:https://jsfiddle.net/b9chris/hweyecu4/17/Starting with a box like:A hidden box.We're going to use a trick found in a related q/a, checking offsetHeight to throttle the browser instantaneously:https://stackoverflow.com/a/16575811/176877First, a library formalizing the above trick:Next, we're going to use it to reveal a box, and fade it in:This fades the box in and out. So, .noTrnsn() turns off transitions, then we remove the hidden class, which flips display from none to its default, block. We then set opacity to 0 to get ready for fading in. Now that we've set the stage, we turn transitions back on, with .resumeTrnsn(). And finally, kick off the transition by setting opacity to 1.Without the library, both the change to display and the change to opacity would've gotten us undesirable results. If we simply removed the library calls, we'd get no transitions at all.Note that the above does not set display to none again at the end of the fadeout animation. We can get fancier though. Let's do so with one that fades in and grows in height from 0.https://jsfiddle.net/b9chris/hweyecu4/22/We're now transitioning both height and opacity. Note that we are not setting height, which means it is the default, auto. Conventionally this cannot be transitioned - moving from auto to a pixel value (like 0) will get you no transition. We're going to work around that with the library, and one more library method:This is a convenience method that lets us participate in jQuery's existing fx/animation queue, without requiring any of the animation framework that's now excluded in jQuery 3.x. I'm not going to explain how jQuery works, but suffice to say, the .queue() and .stop() plumbing that jQuery provides help us prevent our animations from stepping on each other.Let's animate the slide down effect.This code begins by checking on #box and whether it's currently hidden, by checking on its class. But it accomplishes more using the wait() library call, by adding the hidden class at the end of the slideout/fade animation, which you'd expect to find if it is in fact hidden - something the above simpler example could not do. This happens to also enable display/hiding the element over and over, which was a bug in the previous example, because the hidden class was never restored.You can also see CSS and class changes being called after .noTrnsn() to generally set the stage for animations, including taking measurements, like measuring what will be the final height of #box without showing that to the user, before calling .resumeTrnsn(), and animating it from that fully-set stage to its goal CSS values.https://jsfiddle.net/b9chris/hweyecu4/1/You can have it transition on click with:The CSS is what you'd guess:The key is throttling the display property. By removing the hidden class and then waiting 50 ms, then starting the transition via the added class, we get it to appear and then expand like we wanted, instead of it just blipping onto the screen without any animation. Similar occurs going the other way, except we wait till the animation is over before applying hidden.Note: I'm abusing .animate(maxWidth) here to avoid setTimeout race conditions. setTimeout is quick to introduce hidden bugs when you or someone else picks up code unaware of it. .animate() can easily be killed with .stop(). I'm just using it to put a 50 ms or 2000 ms delay on the standard fx queue where it's easy to find/resolve by other coders building on top of this.I had a similar issue that I couldn't find the answer to. A few Google searches later led me here. Considering I didn't find the simple answer I was hoping for, I stumbled upon a solution that is both elegant and effective.It turns out the visibility CSS property has a value collapse which is generally used for table items. However, if used on any other elements it effectively renders them as hidden, pretty much the same as display: hidden but with the added ability that the element doesn't take up any space and you can still animate the element in question.Below is a simple example of this in action.Instead of using display you could store the element 'off-screen' until you needed it, and then set its position to where you want it and transform it at the same time. This brings up a whole host of other design issues though, so your mileage may vary.You probably wouldn't want to use display anyway, as you'd want the content to be accessible to screen readers, which for the most part try to obey rules for visibility - i.e., if it shouldn't be visible to the eye, it won't show up as content to the agent.The simplest universal solution to the problem is: feel free to specify display:none in your CSS, however you will have change it to block (or whatever else) using JavaScript, and then you'll also have to add a class to your element in question that actually does the transition with setTimeout(). That's all.I.e.:This was tested in the latest sane browsers. Obviously it shouldn't work in Internet Explorer 9 or earlier.I think SalmanPK has the closest answer. It does fade an item in or out, with the following CSS animations. However, the display property does not animate smoothly, only the opacity.If you want to animate the element moving from display block to display none, I can't see that it is currently possible just with CSS. You have to get the height and use a CSS animation to decrease the height. This is possible with CSS as shown in the example below, but it would be tricky to know the exact height values you need to animate for an element.jsFiddle exampleYou can do this with transition events, so you build two CSS classes for the transition, one holding the animation other, holding the display none state. And you switch them after the animation is ended? In my case I can display the divs again if I press a button, and remove both classes.Try the snippet below...If you are using jQuery to set your classes, this will work 100%:Of course you could just use jQuery .fadeIn() and .fadeOut() functions, but the advantage of setting classes instead is in case you want to transition to a display value other than block (as is the default with .fadeIn() and .fadeOut()).Here I am transitioning to display flex with a nice fade effect.You can simply use the CSS visibility: hidden/visible instead of display : none/blockYou can also use this:"},

There is a property called background-size which does set the size of the element, but it is CSS 3 which would conflict with Internet Explorer 7 requirements.I would advice you to either redo your browser priorities and design for the best available browsers, or get some server-side code to resize the images if you'd want to use this solution.You could do this:http://jsfiddle.net/DZ8vW/1http://jsfiddle.net/MBs64/The key property is display: table-cell; for .frame.

At least for me it works well:Sometimes it should be solved by displaying as table/table-cell. For example, a fast title screen. It is a recommended way by W3 also. I recommend you check this link called Centering a block or image from W3C.org.The tips used here are:Personally I actually disagree about use helpers for this purpose.My solution: http://jsfiddle.net/XNAj6/2/This works for modern browsers (2016 at time of edit) as shown in this demo on codepenIt is very important that you either give the images a class or use inheritance to target the images that you need centered. In this example we used .frame img {} so that only images wrapped by a div with a class of .frame would be targeted.An easy way which work for me:It works for Google Chrome very well. Try this one out in a different browser.For centering an image inside a container (it could be a logo) besides some text like this:Basically you wrap the imageIf you can live with pixel-sized margins, just add font-size: 1px; to the .frame.

It works in IE8. It does not work in Safari 5, but it does work in Safari 6. Safari 5 is nearly a dead browser (0.33%, August 2015).Most of the possible issues with relative font sizes are not complicated to fix.However, while this is a reasonable solution if you specifically need a CSS only fix, it's not what I recommend if you're free to change your HTML (as most of us are).This is what I, as a reasonably experienced web developer, actually do to solve this problem:Yes, that's right. I remove the whitespace in the HTML between the inline-block elements.It's easy. It's simple. It works everywhere. It's the pragmatic solution.You do sometimes have to carefully consider where whitespace will come from. Will appending another element with JavaScript add whitespace? No, not if you do it properly.Let's go on a magical journey of different ways to remove the whitespace, with some new HTML:Now that I've gone and bored you to death with \"one thousand different ways to remove whitespace, by thirtydot\", hopefully you've forgotten all about font-size: 0.Alternatively, you can now use flexbox to achieve many of the layouts that you may previously have used inline-block for: https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/For CSS3 conforming browsers there is white-space-collapsing:discard see: http://www.w3.org/TR/2010/WD-css3-text-20101005/#white-space-collapsingOK, although I've upvoted both the font-size: 0; and the not implemented CSS3 feature answers, \nafter trying I found out that none of them is a real solution.Actually, there is not even one workaround without strong side effects.Then I decided to remove the spaces (this answers is about this argument) between the inline-block divs from my HTML source (JSP),\nturning this:to thisthat is ugly, but working.But, wait a minute... what if I'm generating my divs inside Taglibs loops (Struts2, JSTL, etc...) ? For example:It is absolutely not thinkable to inline all that stuff, it would meanthat is not readable, hard to mantain and understand, etc...The solution i found: This way you will have a readable and correctly indented code.And, as a positive side effect, the HTML source, although infested by empty comments, \nwill result correctly indented; let's take the first example. In my humble opinion, this:is better than this:Add comments between elements to NOT have a white space. For me it is easier than resetting font size to zero and then setting it back.All the space elimination techniques for display:inline-block are nasty hacks...  Use Flexbox It's awesome, solves all this inline-block layout bs, and as of 2017 has 98% browser support (more if you don't care about old IEs). This is the same answer I gave over on the related: Display: Inline block - What is that space?There’s actually a really simple way to remove whitespace from inline-block that’s both easy and semantic. It’s called a custom font with zero-width spaces, which allows you to collapse the whitespace (added by the browser for inline elements when they're on separate lines) at the font level using a very tiny font. Once you declare the font, you just change the font-family on the container and back again on the children, and voila. Like this:Suit to taste. Here’s a download to the font I just cooked up in font-forge and converted with FontSquirrel webfont generator. Took me all of 5 minutes. The css @font-face declaration is included: zipped zero-width space font. It's in Google Drive so you'll need to click File > Download to save it to your computer. You'll probably need to change the font paths as well if you copy the declaration to your main css file.Add display: flex; to the parent element. Here is the solution with a prefix:Simplified version 👇Two more options based on CSS Text Module Level 3 (instead of white-space-collapsing:discard which had been dropped from the spec draft):In theory, it should do exactly what is needed — shorten whitespaces\n    between 'words' by the 100% of the space character width, i.e. to\n    zero. But seems not to work anywhere, unfortunately, and this\n    feature is marked 'at risk' (it can be dropped from the specification, too).It shortens the inter-word spaces by the width of the digit '0'. In a monospace font it should be exactly equal to the width of the space character (and any other character as well). This works in Firefox 10+, Chrome 27+, and almost works in Internet Explorer 9+.FiddleUnfortunately, it is 2019 and white-space-collapse is still not implemented.In the meantime, give the parent element font-size: 0; and set the font-size on the children. This should do the trickUse flexbox and do a fallback (from suggestions above) for older browsers:Simple:There is no need to touch the parent element.Only condition here: the item's font-size must not be defined (must be equal to parent's font-size).0.25em is the default word-spacingW3Schools - word-spacing propertyfont-size:0; can be a bit trickier to manage...I think the following couple lines is a lot better and more re-usable, and time saver than any other methods.

We could simply set letter-spacing to a large negative value in parent and then set it back to normal at child elements:The simplest answer to this question is to add.csscodepen link: http://jsfiddle.net/dGHFV/3560/With PHP brackets:I'm going to expand on user5609829's answer a little bit as I believe the other solutions here are too complicated/too much work.  Applying a margin-right: -4px to the inline block elements will remove the spacing and is supported by all browsers.  See the updated fiddle here.  For those concerned with using negative margins, try giving this a read. The CSS Text Module Level 4 specification defines a text-space-collapse property, which allow to control the how white space inside and around an element is processed.So, regarding your example, you would just have to write this:Unfortunately, no browser is implementing this property yet (as of September 2016) as mentioned in the comments to the answer of HBP.Add white-space: nowrap to the container element:CSS:HTML:Here is the Plunker.There are lots of solutions like font-size:0,word-spacing,margin-left,letter-spacing and so on.Normally I prefer using letter-spacing becauseSo, letter-spacing seems to be the best choice.However, I have to warn you when you using letter-spacing you had better using -0.3em or -0.31em not others.If you are using Chrome(test version 66.0.3359.139) or Opera(test version 53.0.2907.99), what you see might be:If you are using Firefox(60.0.2),IE10 or Edge, what you see might be:That's interesting. So, I checked the mdn-letter-spacing and found this:It seems that this is the reason.Add letter-spacing:-4px; on parent p css and add letter-spacing:0px; to your span css. I thought I'd add something new to this question as although many of the answers currently provided are more than adequate & relevant, there are some new CSS properties which can achieve a very clean output, with full support across all browsers, and little to no 'hacks'. This does move away from inline-block but it gives you the same results as the question asked for.These CSS properties are gridCSS Grid is highly supported (CanIUse) apart from IE which only needs an -ms- prefix to allow for it to work.CSS Grid is also highly flexible, and takes all the good parts from table, flex, and inline-block elements and brings them into one place.When creating a grid you can specify the gaps between the rows and columns. The default gap is already set to 0px but you can change this value to whatever you like. To cut it a bit short, heres a relevant working example:One another way I found is applying margin-left as negative values except the first element of the row.Every question, that try to remove the space between inline-blocks seems like a <table> to me...Try something like this:I found a pure CSS solution that worked for me very well in all browsers:"},

Every browser could have a different and specific property for their respective bars.For Microsoft Edge use: -ms-overflow-style: -ms-autohiding-scrollbar; or -ms-overflow-style: none; as per MSDN.There is no equivalent for Firefox.\nAlthough there is a jQuery plugin to achieve this,\nhttp://manos.malihu.gr/tuts/jquery_custom_scrollbar.htmlThis answer doesn't include the code, so here is the solution from page:According to the page this approach doesn't need to know the width of the scrollbar ahead of time in order to work and the solution works for all browsers too, and can be seen here.The good thing is that you are not forced to use padding or width differences to hide the scrollbar.This is also zoom safe. Padding/width solutions show the scrollbar when zoomed to minimum.Firefox fix: http://jsbin.com/mugiqoveko/1/edit?outputJust use following three lines and your problem will be solved:Where liaddshapes is the name of the div where scroll is coming.This works for me cross-browser. However, this doesn't hide native scrollbars on mobile browsers.In SCSSIn CSSThe following was working for me on Microsoft, Chrome and Mozilla for a specific div element:HTML:CSS:Apply CSS accordingly.Check it here\n(tested in Internet Explorer and Firefox).As of December 11th 2018 (Firefox 64 and above), the answer to this question is very simple indeed as Firefox 64+ now implements the CSS Scrollbar Styling spec.Just use the following CSS:Firefox 64 release note link here.Use:UseCall these functions for any point you want to load or unload or reload the scrollbars. It is still scrollable in Chrome as I tested it in Chrome, but I am not sure of the other browsers.This works for me: On modern browsers you can use wheel event:My problem: I don't want any style in my HTML content. I want my body directly scrollable without any scrollbar, and only a vertical scroll, working with CSS grids for any screen size.The box-sizing value impact padding or margin solutions, they works with box-sizing:content-box.I still need the \"-moz-scrollbars-none\" directive, and like gdoron and Mr_Green, I had to hide the scrollbar. I tried -moz-transform and -moz-padding-start, to impact only Firefox, but there was responsive side effects that needed too much work.This solution works for HTML body content with \"display: grid\" style, and it is responsive.Adding padding to an inner div, as in the currently accepted answer, won't work if for some reason you want to use box-model: border-box.What does work in both cases is increasing the width of the inner div to 100% plus the scrollbar's width (assuming overflow: hidden on the outer div).For example, in CSS:In JavaScript, cross-browser:This is how I do it for horizontal scroll; only CSS and works well with frameworks like Bootstrap / col-*. It only needs two extra divs and the parent with a width or max-width set:You can select the text to make it scroll or scroll it with fingers if you have a touchscreen.Short version for lazy people:I happen to try the above solutions in my project and for some reason I was not able to hide the scroll bar due to div positioning.  Hence, I decided to hide the scroll bar by introducing a div that covers it superficially.  Example below is for a horizontal scroll bar:Corresponding CSS is as follows:This will be at the body:And this is the CSS:This is a divitis-esque solution which nontheless should work for all browsers...The markup is as follows and needs to be inside something with relative positioning (and its width should be set, for example 400 pixels):The CSS:The perfect-scrollbar plugin seems to be the way to go, see: https://github.com/noraesae/perfect-scrollbarIt is a well-documented and complete JavaScript-based solution for the scrollbars issue.Demo page: http://noraesae.github.io/perfect-scrollbar/Another sort of hacky approach is to do overflow-y: hidden and then manually scroll the element with something like this:There's a great article about how to detect and deal with onmousewheel events in deepmikoto's blog.\nThis might work for you, but it is definitively not an elegant solution.I just wanted to share a combined snippet for hiding the scrollbar that I use when developing. It is a collection of several snippets found on the Internet that works for me:You can use the code below to hide the scroll bar, but while still being able to scroll:Another simple working fiddle:Overflow hidden on the parent container, and overflow auto on the child container. Simple.The following SASS styling should make your scrollbar transparent on most browsers (Firefox is not supported):Just set the width of the child's width to 100%, padding to 15 pixels, overflow-x to scroll and overflow:hidden for the parent and whatever width you want.It works perfectly on all major browsers, including Internet Explorer and Edge with the exception of Internet Explorer 8 and lower.Hide both horizontal and vertical scroll bars.See Fiddle hereHTMLCSSI had this problem, and it is super simple to fix.Get two containers. The inner will be your scrollable container and the outer will obviously house the inner:It is super simple and should work with any browser."},

I need a way to offset the anchor by the 25px from the height of the header. I would prefer HTML or CSS, but Javascript would be acceptable as well.You could just use CSS without any javascript.Give your anchor a class:You can then position the anchor an offset higher or lower than where it actually appears on the page, by making it a block element and relatively positioning it. -250px will position the anchor up 250pxI found this solution:This doesn't create any gap in the content and anchor links works really nice.As this is a concern of presentation, a pure CSS solution would be ideal. However, this question was posed in 2012, and although relative positioning / negative margin solutions have been suggested, these approaches seem rather hacky, create potential flow issues, and cannot respond dynamically to changes in the DOM / viewport.With that in mind I believe that using JavaScript is still (February 2017) the best approach. Below is a vanilla-JS solution which will respond both to anchor clicks and resolve the page hash on load (See JSFiddle). Modify the .getFixedOffset() method if dynamic calculations are required. If you're using jQuery, here's a modified solution with better event delegation and smooth scrolling.I was looking for a solution to this as well. In my case, it was pretty easy.I have a list menu with all the links:And below that the headings where it should go to.Now because I have a fixed menu at the top of my page I can't just make it go to my  tag because that would be behind the menu.Instead, I put a span tag inside my  tag with the proper id.Now use 2 lines of CSS to position them properly.Change the top value to match the height of your fixed header (or more).\nNow I assume this would work with other elements as well.FWIW this worked for me:Pure css solution inspired by Alexander Savin:Optionally you may want to add the following if the target is still off the screen:This takes many elements from previous answers and combines into a tiny (194 bytes minified) anonymous jQuery function.  Adjust fixedElementHeight for the height of your menu or blocking element.If you don't like the animation, replacewith:Uglified version:My solution combines the target and before selectors for our CMS. Other techniques don't account for text in the anchor. Adjust the height and the negative margin to the offset you need...I had been facing a similar issue, unfortunately after implementing all the solutions above, I came to the following conclusion.I wrote this simple scrolling js, that accounts for the offset caused due to the header and relocated the div about 125 pixels below. Please use it as you see fit.The HTMLThe JavaScriptSee a live implementation here.For modern browsers, just add the CSS3 :target selector to the page. This will apply to all the anchors automatically.That will append a pseudo-element before every a-tag with an id. Adjust values to match the height of your header.As @moeffju suggests, this can be achieved with CSS. The issue I ran into (which I'm surprised I haven't seen discussed) is the trick of overlapping previous elements with padding or a transparent border prevents hover and click actions at the bottom of those sections because the following one comes higher in the z-order.The best fix I found was to place section content in a div that is at z-index: 1:Solutions with changing position property are not always possible (it can destroy layout) therefore I suggest this:HTML:CSS:Use this:to minimize overlapping, and set font-size to 1px. Empty anchor will not work in some browsers.For the same issue, I used an easy solution : put a padding-top of 40px on each anchor.Borrowing some of the code from an answer given at this link (no author is specified), you can include a nice smooth-scroll effect to the anchor, while making it stop at -60px above the anchor, fitting nicely underneath the fixed bootstrap navigation bar (requires jQuery):I ran into this same issue and ended up handling the click events manually, like:Scroll animation optional, of course.The above methods don't work very well if your anchor is a table element or within a table (row or cell).I had to use javascript and bind to the window hashchange event to work around this (demo):* Note: The hashchange event is not available in all browsers.Instead of having a fixed-position navbar which is underlapped by the rest of the content of the page (with the whole page body being scrollable), consider instead having a non-scrollable body with a static navbar and then having the page content in an absolutely-positioned scrollable div below.That is, have HTML like this...... and CSS like this:This achieves the desired result in a straightforward, non-hacky way. The only difference in behaviour between this and some of the clever CSS hacks suggested above are that the scrollbar (in browsers that render one) will be attached to the content div rather than the whole height of the page. You may or may not consider this desirable.Here's a JSFiddle demonstrating this in action.You can achieve this without an ID using the a[name]:not([href]) css selector. This simply looks for links with a name and no href e.g. <a name=\"anc1\"></a>An example rule might be:This was inspired by the answer by Shouvik - same concept as his, only the size of the fixed header isn't hard coded. As long as your fixed header is in the first header node, this should \"just work\"I'm facing this problem in a TYPO3 website, where all \"Content Elements\" are wrapped with something like:and i changed the rendering so it renders like this:And this CSS:The fixed topbar being 40px high, now the anchors work again and start 10px under the topbar.Only drawback of this technique is you can no longer use :target. Adding to Ziav's answer (with thanks to Alexander Savin), I need to be using the old-school <a name=\"...\">...</a> as we're using <div id=\"...\">...</div> for another purpose in our code. I had some display issues using display: inline-block -- the first line of every <p> element was turning out to be slightly right-indented (on both Webkit and Firefox browsers). I ended up trying other display values and display: table-caption works perfectly for me.I added 40px-height .vspace element holding the anchor before each of my h1 elements.In the CSS:It's working great and the space is not chocking.how about hidden span tags with linkable IDs that provide the height of the navbar:heres the fiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/N6f2f/7You can also add an anchor with follow attr:and give the parent container a position relative.Works perfect for me.A further twist to the excellent answer from @Jan is to incorporate this into the #uberbar fixed header, which uses jQuery (or MooTools). (http://davidwalsh.name/persistent-header-opacity)I've tweaked the code so the the top of the content is always below not under the fixed header and also added the anchors from @Jan again making sure that the anchors are always positioned below the fixed header.The CSS:The jQuery (including tweaks to both the #uberbar and the anchor approaches:And finally the HTML:Maybe this is useful to somebody who likes the #uberbar fading dixed header!@AlexanderSavin's solution works great in WebKit browsers for me.I additionally had to use :target pseudo-class which applies style to the selected anchor to adjust padding in FF, Opera & IE9:Note that this style is not for Chrome / Safari so you'll probably have to use css-hacks, conditional comments etc.Also I'd like to notice that Alexander's solution works due to the fact that targeted element is inline. If you don't want link you could simply change display property:Here's the solution that we use on our site. Adjust the headerHeight variable to whatever your header height is.

When I tried it I had problems with dropdown menus appearing below the content.  It's just not pretty.Honestly, for vertical centering issues and, well, any vertical alignment issues with the items aren't fixed height, it's easier just to use tables.Example: Can you do this HTML layout without using tables?Use CSS positioning:As cletus noted, you need identify the header-content to make this work.I use these properties and it works!If you're not worried about legacy browsers use a flexbox.The parent element needs its display type set to flexThen you set the child element's align-self to flex-end.Here's the resource I used to learn:\nhttp://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/After struggling with this same issue for some time, I finally figured out a solution that meets all of my requirements:The solution just takes one <div>, which I call the \"aligner\":CSShtmlThis trick works by creating a tall, skinny div, which pushes the text baseline to the bottom of the container.Here is a complete example that achieves what the OP was asking for.  I've made the \"bottom_aligner\" thick and red for demonstration purposes only.CSS:HTML:The modern way to do it would be using flexbox. See the example below. You don't even need to wrap Some text... into any HTML tag, since text directly contained in a flex container is wrapped in an anonymous flex item.If there is only some text and you want to align vertically to the bottom of the container.Inline or inline-block elements can be aligned to the bottom of block level elements if the line-height of the parent/block element is greater than that of the inline element.*markup:css:*make sure you're in standards modeYou can simply achieved flexIf you have multiple, dynamic height items, use the CSS display values of table and table-cell:HTMLCSSI've created a JSBin demo here: http://jsbin.com/INOnAkuF/2/editThe demo also has an example how to vertically center align using the same technique.Here is another solution using flexbox but without using flex-end for bottom alignment. The idea is to set margin-bottom on h1 to auto to push the remaining content to the bottom:We can also do the same with margin-top:auto on the text but in this case we need to wrap it inside a div or span:You don't need absolute+relative for this. It is very much possible using relative position for both container and data. This is how you do it.Assume height of your data is going to be x. Your container is relative and footer is also relative. All you have to do is add to your dataYour data will always be at the bottom of your container. Works even if you have container with dynamic height.HTML will be like thisCSS will be like thisLive example hereHope this helps. Here's the flexy way to do it. Of course, it's not supported by IE8, as the user needed 7 years ago. Depending on what you need to support, some of these can be done away with.Still, it would be nice if there was a way to do this without an outer container, just have the text align itself within it's own self.a very simple, one-line solution, is to add line-heigth to the div, having in mind that all the div's text will go bottom.CSS:HTML:keep in mind that this is a practical and fast solution when you just want text inside div to go down, if you need to combine images and stuff, you will have to code a bit more complex and responsive CSSif you could set the height of the wrapping div of the content (#header-content as shown in other's reply), instead of the entire #header, maybe you can also try this approach:HTMLCSSshow on codepenSeems to be working:HTML:\n    I'm at the bottomcss:All these answers and none worked for me... I'm no flexbox expert, but this was reasonably easy to figure out, it is simple and easy to understand and use. To separate something from the rest of the content, insert an empty div and let it grow to fill the space.https://jsfiddle.net/8sfeLmgd/1/This reacts as expected when the bottom content is not fixed sized also when the container is not fixed sized.I have devised a way which is a lot simpler than what's  been mentioned.Set the height of the header div. Then inside that, style your H1 tag as follows:I'm working on a site for a client, and the design requires the text to be at the bottom of a certain div. I've achieved the result using these two lines, and it works fine. Also, if the text does expand, the padding will still remain the same.I found this solution bassed on a default bootstrap start templatetry with:try changing the % to fix it. Example: 120% or 90% ...etc.The site I just did for a client requested that the footer text was a high box, with the text at the bottom I achieved this with simple padding, should work for all browsers.A perfect cross-browser example is probably this one here:http://www.csszengarden.com/?cssfile=/213/213.css&page=0The idea is both to display the div at the bottom and also making it stick there. Often the simple approach will make the sticky div scroll up with the main content.Following is a fully working minimal example. Note that there's no div embedding trickery required. The many BRs are just to force a scrollbar to appear:If you are wondering your code might not be working on IE, remember to add the DOCTYPE tag at the top. It's crucial for this to work on IE. Also, this should be the first tag and nothing should appear above it.Seems to be working:Using less makes solving CSS puzzles much more like coding than like... I just love CSS.

Before you use a clearfix perhaps these modern css solutions can be useful:The simplest way to clear floated elements is using the style overflow: auto on the containing element. This solution works in every modern browsers.One downside, using certain combinations of margin and padding on the external element can cause scrollbars to appear but this can be solved by placing the margin and padding on another parent containing element.Using ‘overflow: hidden’ is also a clearfix solution, but will not have scrollbars, however using hidden will crop any content positioned outside of the containing element.Note: The floated element is an img tag in this example, but could be any html element.Thierry Koblentz on CSSMojo wrote: The very latest clearfix reloaded. He noted that by dropping support for oldIE, the solution can be simplified to one css statement. Additionally, using display: block (instead of display: table) allows margins to collapse properly when elements with clearfix are siblings.This is the most modern version of the clearfix.⋮⋮The below solutions are not necessary for modern browsers, but may be useful for targeting older browsers.Note that these solutions rely upon browser bugs and therefore should be used only if none of the above solutions work for you.They are listed roughly in chronological order.Thierry Koblentz' of CSS Mojo has pointed out that when targeting modern browsers, we can now drop the zoom and ::before property/values and simply use:This solution does not support for IE 6/7 …on purpose!Thierry also offers: \"A word of caution: if you start a new project from scratch, go for it, but don’t swap this technique with the one you have now, because even though you do not support oldIE, your existing rules prevent collapsing margins.\"The most recent and globally adopted clearfix solution, the Micro Clearfix by Nicolas Gallagher.Known support: Firefox 3.5+, Safari 4+, Chrome, Opera 9+, IE 6+This basic method is preferred for the usual case, when positioned content will not show outside the bounds of the container.http://www.quirksmode.org/css/clearing.html\n- explains how to resolve common issues related to this technique, namely, setting width: 100% on the container.Rather than using the display property to set \"hasLayout\" for IE, other properties can be used for triggering \"hasLayout\" for an element.Another way to clear floats using the overflow property is to use the underscore hack. IE will apply the values prefixed with the underscore, other browsers will not. The zoom property triggers hasLayout in IE:While this works... it is not ideal to use hacks.This older \"Easy Clearing\" method has the advantage of allowing positioned elements to hang outside the bounds of the container, at the expense of more tricky CSS.This solution is quite old, but you can learn all about Easy Clearing on Position Is Everything: http://www.positioniseverything.net/easyclearing.htmlThe quick and dirty solution (with some drawbacks) for when you’re quickly slapping something together:There are two important considerations when floating stuff:There's only one way to do both of these. And that is to establish a new block formatting context. Elements that establish a block formatting context are an insulated rectangle in which floats interact with each other. A block formatting context will always be tall enough to visually wrap its floating descendants, and no floats outside of a block formatting context may interact with elements inside. This two-way insulation is exactly what you want. In IE, this same concept is called hasLayout, which can be set via zoom: 1.There are several ways to establish a block formatting context, but the solution I recommend is display: inline-block with width: 100%. (Of course, there are the usual caveats with using width: 100%, so use box-sizing: border-box or put padding, margin, and border on a different element.)Probably the most common application of floats is the two-column layout. (Can be extended to three columns.)First the markup structure.And now the CSS.Go to JS Bin to play around with the code and see how this solution is built from the ground up.The problem with the traditional clearfix solutions is that they use two different rendering concepts to achieve the same goal for IE and everyone else. In IE they use hasLayout to establish a new block formatting context, but for everyone else they use generated boxes (:after) with clear: both, which does not establish a new block formatting context. This means things won't behave the same in all situations. For an explanation of why this is bad, see Everything you Know about Clearfix is Wrong.The new standard, as used by Inuit.css and Bourbon - two very widely used and well-maintained CSS/Sass frameworks:Keep in mind that clearfixes are essentially a hack for what flexbox layouts can now provide in a much smarter way. CSS floats were originally designed for inline content to flow around - like images in a long textual article - and not for grid layouts and the like. If your target browsers support flexbox, it's worth looking into.This doesn't support IE7. You shouldn't be supporting IE7. Doing so continues to expose users to unfixed security exploits and makes life harder for all other web developers, as it reduces the pressure on users and organisations to switch to modern browsers.This clearfix was announced and explained by Thierry Koblentz in July 2012. It sheds unnecessary weight from Nicolas Gallagher's 2011 micro-clearfix. In the process, it frees a pseudo-element for your own use. This has been updated to use display: block rather than display: table (again, credit to Thierry Koblentz).I recommend using the following, which is taken from http://html5boilerplate.com/The overflow property can be used to clear floats with no additional mark-up:This works for all browsers except IE6, where all you need to do is enable hasLayout (zoom being my preferred method):http://www.quirksmode.org/css/clearing.htmlI've found a bug in the official CLEARFIX-Method:\nThe DOT doesn't have a font-size.\nAnd if you set the height = 0 and the first Element in your DOM-Tree has the class \"clearfix\" you'll allways have a margin at the bottom of the page of 12px :)You have to fix it like this:It's now part of the YAML-Layout ... Just take a look at it - it's very interesting!\nhttp://www.yaml.de/en/home.htmlThis is quite a tidy solution: From http://nicolasgallagher.com/micro-clearfix-hack/Clearfix from bootstrap:I just use :-Works best and compatible with IE8+ :)Given the huge amount of replies I was not gonna post. However, this method may help someone, as it did help me.It's worth to mention, I avoid floats like Ebola. There's many reasons and I am not alone; Read Rikudo answer about what is a clearfix and you'll see what I mean. In his own words: ...the use of floated elements for layout is getting more and more discouraged with the use of better alternatives... There are other good (and sometimes better) options out there other than floats. As technology advances and improves, flexbox (and other methods) are going to be widely adopted and floats will become just a bad memory. Maybe a CSS4?First off, sometimes, you may think that you are safe from floats until your lifesaver is punctured and your html flow starts to sink:In the codepen http://codepen.io/omarjuvera/pen/jEXBya below, the practice of clearing a float with <div classs=\"clear\"></div> (or other element) is common but frown upon and anti-semantic.CSSHowever, just when you thought your float is sail worthy...boom! As the screen size becomes smaller and smaller you see weird behaviors in like the graphic below (Same http://codepen.io/omarjuvera/pen/jEXBya):Why should you care?\nI am not sure of the exact figure but about 80% (or more) of the devices used are mobile devices with small screens. Desktop computers/laptops are no longer king.This is not the only problem with floats. There are many, but in this example, some may say all you have to do is to place your floats in a container. But as you can see in the codepen and graphic, that is not the case. It apparently made things worst:HTMLCSSAs for the result?It's the *** same!\nLeast you know, you'll start a CSS party, inviting all kinds of selectors and properties to the party; making a bigger mess of your CSS than what you started with. Just to fix your float.This simple and very adaptable piece of CSS is a beauty and a \"savior\":That's it! It really works without breaking semantics and did I mention it works?:From the same sample...HTMLCSSNow we no longer need <div classs=\"clear\"></div> <!-- Acts as a wall --> and keep the semantic police happy. This is not the only benefit. This clearfix is responsive to any screen size without the use of @media in it's simplest form. In other words, it will keep your float container in check and preventing floodings. Lastly, it provides support for old browsers all in one small karate chop =) I always float the main sections of my grid and apply clear: both; to the footer. That doesn't require an extra div or class.honestly; all solutions seem to be a hack to fix a rendering bug ... am i wrong?i've found <br clear=\"all\" /> to be the easiest, simplest. seeing class=\"clearfix\" everywhere can't stroke the sensibilities of someone who objects to extraneous markeup elements, can it? you're just painting the problem on a different canvas.i also use the display: hidden solution, which is great and requires no extra class declarations or html markup ... but sometimes you need the elements to overflow the container, for eg. pretty ribbons and sashesI have tried all these solutions, a big margin will be added to <html> element automatically when I use the code below:Finally, I solved the margin problem by adding font-size: 0; to the above CSS.With SASS, the clearfix is:and it's used like:if you want the new clearfix:With LESS (http://lesscss.org/), one can create a handy clearfix helper:And then use it with problematic containers, for example:Using overflow:hidden/auto and height for ie6 will suffice if the floating container has a parent element. Either one of the #test could work, for the HTML stated below to clear floats.In cases when this refuses to work with ie6, just float the parent to clear float. Never really needed any other kind of clearing yet. Maybe it's the way I write my HTML.I'd float #content too, that way both columns contain floats. Also because it will allow you to clear elements inside #content without clearing the side bar.Same thing with the wrapper, you'd need to make it a block formatting context to wrap the two columns.This article mentions a few triggers you can use:\nblock formatting contexts.A clearfix is a way for an element to automatically clear after itself, \nso that you don't need to add additional markup.Normally you would need to do something as follows:With clearfix, you only need toA new display value seems to the job in one line.From the w3 spec: \"The element generates a block container box, and lays out its contents using flow layout. It always establishes a new block formatting context for its contents.\"Information:\nhttps://www.w3.org/TR/css-display-3/#valdef-display-flow-root\nhttps://www.chromestatus.com/feature/5769454877147136※As shown in the link above, support is currently limited so fallback support like below may be of use:\nhttps://github.com/fliptheweb/postcss-flow-rootWhy just trying to use css hack to do what 1 line of HTML do the job. And why not to use semantic html tu put break to return to the line?Fo me is realy better to use : And if you don't want any style in your html you just have to use class for your break\n\nand put .clear { clear:both; } in your CSS.Advantage of this:Assuming you're using this HTML structure:Here's the CSS that I would use:I use this set all the time and it works fine for me, even in IE6.Other clearfixes either require the floated element to be in a well marked off container or need an extra, semantically empty <div>. Conversely, clear separation of content and markup requires a strict CSS solution to this problem.The mere fact that one needs to mark off the end of a float, does not allow for unattended CSS typesetting.If the latter is your goal, the float should be left open for anything (paragraphs, ordered and unordered lists etc.) to wrap around it, until a \"clearfix\" is encountered. For example, the clearfix might be set by a new heading.This is why I use the following clearfix with new headings:This solution gets used extensively on my website to solve the problem: The text next to a floated miniature is short and the top-margin of the next clearing object is not respected.It also prevents any manual intervention when automatically generating PDFs from the site.\nHere is an example page.I always use the micro-clearfix :In Cascade Framework I even apply it by default on block level elements. IMO, applying it by default on block level elements gives block level elements more intuitive behavior than their traditonal behavior. It also made it a lot easier for me to add support for older browsers to Cascade Framework (which supports IE6-8 as well as modern browsers).You could also put this in your CSS:And add class \"cb\" to your parent div:You will not need to add anything else to your original code...Have you tried this:I haven't had any problems with this method.My Favourite Method is to create a clearfix class in my css / scss document as below And then call it in my html document as shown below It is so simple clearfix clears the issue by when we using the float properties inside the div element.If we use two div elements one as float:left; and other one as float:right; we can use clearfix for the parent of the two div element. If we refuse to use clearfix unnecessary spaces fill with contents below and site structure will be broken. "},

It is clear that we could add async or use setTimeout to free up the render thread or put the JavaScript code in the footer, or use a JavaScript loader. The point here is about ordering of essential JavaScript bits and CSS bits in the head.This is a very interesting question.  I've always put my CSS <link href=\"...\">s before my JS <script src=\"...\">s because \"I read one time that it's better.\"  So, you're right; it's high time we do some actual research!I set up my own test harness in Node (code below).  Basically, I:First, with the CSS file delayed by 500ms:Next, I set jQuery to delay by 500ms instead of the CSS:Finally, I set both jQuery and the CSS to delay by 500ms:First, it's important to note that I'm operating under the assumption that you have scripts located in the <head> of your document (as opposed to the end of the <body>).  There are various arguments regarding why you might link to your scripts in the <head> versus the end of the document, but that's outside the scope of this answer.  This is strictly about whether <script>s should go before <link>s in the <head>.In modern DESKTOP browsers, it looks like linking to CSS first never provides a performance gain.  Putting CSS after script gets you a trivial amount of gain when both CSS and script are delayed, but gives you large gains when CSS is delayed.  (Shown by the last columns in the first set of results.)Given that linking to CSS last does not seem to hurt performance but can provide gains under certain circumstances, you should link to external stylesheets after you link to external scripts only on desktop browsers if the performance of old browsers is not a concern.  Read on for the mobile situation.Historically, when a browser encountered a <script> tag pointing to an external resource, the browser would stop parsing the HTML, retrieve the script, execute it, then continue parsing the HTML.  In contrast, if the browser encountered a <link> for an external stylesheet, it would continue parsing the HTML while it fetched the CSS file (in parallel).Hence, the widely-repeated advice to put stylesheets first – they would download first, and the first script to download could be loaded in parallel.However, modern browsers (including all of the browsers I tested with above) have implemented speculative parsing, where the browser \"looks ahead\" in the HTML and begins downloading resources before scripts download and execute.In old browsers without speculative parsing, putting scripts first will affect performance since they will not download in parallel.Speculative parsing was first implemented in: (along with the percentage of worldwide desktop browser users using this version or greater as of Jan 2012)In total, roughly 85% of desktop browsers in use today support speculative loading.  Putting scripts before CSS will have a performance penalty on 15% of users globally; YMMV based on your site's specific audience.  (And remember that number is shrinking.)On mobile browsers, it's a little harder to get definitive numbers simply due to how heterogeneous the mobile browser and OS landscape is.  Since speculative rendering was implemented in WebKit 525 (released Mar 2008), and just about every worthwhile mobile browser is based on WebKit, we can conclude that \"most\" mobile browsers should support it.  According to quirksmode, iOS 2.2/Android 1.0 use WebKit 525.  I have no idea what Windows Phone looks like.However, I ran the test on my Android 4 device, and while I saw numbers similar to the desktop results, I hooked it up to the fantastic new remote debugger in Chrome for Android, and Network tab showed that the browser was actually waiting to download the CSS until the JavaScripts completely loaded – in other words, even the newest version of WebKit for Android does not appear to support speculative parsing.  I suspect it might be turned off due to the CPU, memory, and/or network constraints inherent to mobile devices.Forgive the sloppiness – this was Q&D.app.jscss.htmljs.htmltest.jsjquery.js was jquery-1.7.1.min.jsThere are two main reasons to put CSS before JavaScript.It's fun to create examples with Cuzillion. For example, this page has a script in the HEAD so the entire page is blank until it's done downloading. However, if we move the script to the end of the BODY block the page header renders since those DOM elements occur above the SCRIPT tag, as you can see on this page.I would not emphasize too much on the results that you have got, I believe that it is subjective, but I have a reason to explain you that it is better to put in CSS before js.During the loading of your website, there are two scenarios that you would see:CASE 1:    white screen > unstyled website > styled website > interaction > styled and interactive website\nCASE 2:    white screen > unstyled website > interaction > styled website > styled and interactive website\n\nI honestly can't imagine anyone choosing Case 2. This would mean that visitors using slow internet connections will be faced with an unstyled website, that allows them to interact with it using Javascript (since that is already loaded). Furthermore, the amount of time spend looking at an unstyled website would be maximized this way. Why would anyone want that?It also works better as jQuery states When the files are loaded in the wrong order (first JS, then CSS), any Javascript code relying on properties set in CSS files (for example the width or height of a div) won't be loaded correctly. It seems that with the wrong loading order, the correct properties are 'sometimes' known to Javascript (perhaps this is caused by a race condition?). This effect seems bigger or smaller depending on the browser used.Were your tests performed on your personal computer, or on a web server? It is a blank page, or is it a complex online system with images, databases, etc.? Are your scripts performing a simple hover event action, or are they a core component to how your website renders and interacts with the user? There are several things to consider here, and the relevance of these recommendations almost always become rules when you venture into high-caliber web development.The purpose of the \"put stylesheets at the top and scripts at the bottom\" rule is that, in general, it's the best way to achieve optimal progressive rendering, which is critical to the user experience.All else aside: assuming your test is valid, and you really are producing results contrary to the popular rules, it'd come as no surprise, really. Every website (and everything it takes to make the whole thing appear on a user's screen) is different and the Internet is constantly evolving. I include CSS files before Javascript for a different reason.If my Javascript needs to do dynamic sizing of some page element (for those corner cases where CSS is really a main in the back) then loading the CSS after the JS is russing can lead to race conditions, where the element is resized before CSS styles are applied and thus looks weird when the styles finally kick in. If I load the CSS beforehand I can guarantee that things run in the intended order and that the final layout is what I want it to be.Is the recommendation to include CSS before JavaScript invalid?Not if you treat it as simply a recommendation. But if your treat it as a hard and fast rule?, yes, it is invalid.From https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Reference/Events/DOMContentLoadedIt appears that you need to know what each script relies on and make sure that execution of the script is delayed until after the right completion event. If the script relies only on the DOM, it can resume in ondomready/domcontentloaded, if it relies on images to be loaded or stylesheets to be applied, then if I read the above reference correctly, that code must be deferred until the onload event.I don't think that one sock size fits all, even though that is the way they are sold and I know that one shoe size does not fit all. I don't think that there is a definitive answer to which to load first, styles or script. It is more a case by case decision of what must be loaded in what order and what can be deferred until later as not being on the \"critical path\".To speak to the observer that commented that it is better to delay the users ability to interact until the sheet is pretty. There are many of you out there and you annoy your counterparts that feel the opposite. They came to a site to accomplish a purpose and delays to their ability to interact with a site while waiting for things that don't matter to finish loading are very frustrating.  I am not saying that you are wrong, only that you should be aware that there is another faction that exists that does not share your priority.This question particularly applies to all of the ads being placed on web sites. I would love it if site authors rendered just placeholder divs for the ad content and made sure that their site was loaded and interactive before injecting the ads in an onload event.  Even then I would like to see the ads loaded serially instead of all at once because they impact my ability to even scroll the site content while the bloated ads are loading. But that is just one persons point of view.Updated 2017-12-16I was not sure about the tests in OP. I decided to experiment a little and ended up busting some of the myths.This is no longer true. Have a look at the waterfall generated by Chrome 63:This is incorrect. The stylesheet will not block download but it will block execution of the script (little explanation here). Have a look at performance chart generated by Chrome 63:Keeping the above in mind, the results in OP can be explained as follows:CSS First:JS First:I'm not exactly sure how your testing 'render' time as your using java script. However consider thisOne page on your site is 50k which is not unreasonable. The user is on the east coast while your server is on the west. MTU is definitely not 10k so there will be a few trips back and forth. It may take 1/2 a second to receive your page and stylesheets. Typically (for me) javascript (via jquery plugin and such) are much more than CSS. Theres also what happens when your internet connection chokes up midway on the page but lets ignore that (it happens to me occasionally and i believe the css renders but i am not 100% sure).Since css is in head there may be additional connections to get it which means it potentially can finish before the page does. Anyways during the type the remainder of the page takes and the javascript files (which is many more bytes) the page is unstyled which makes the site/connection appear slow.EVEN IF the JS interpreter refuses to start until the CSS is done the time taken to download the javascript code especially when far from the server is cutting into css time which will make the site look not pretty.Its a small optimization but thats the reason for it.Here is a SUMMARY of all the major answers above (or maybe below later :)For modern browsers, put css wherever you like it. They would analyze your html file (which they call speculative parsing) and start downloading css in parallel with html parsing. For old browsers keep putting css on top (if you don't want to show a naked but interactive page first).For all browsers, put javascript as farther down on the page as possible, since it will halt parsing of your html. Preferably, download it asynchronously (i.e., ajax call)There are also, some experimental results for a particular case which claims putting javascript first (as opposed to traditional wisdom of putting CSS first) gives better performance but there is no logical reasoning given for it, and lacks validation regarding widespread applicability, so you can ignore it for now. So, to answer the question: Yes. The recommendation to include the CSS before JS is invalid for the modern browsers. Put CSS wherever you like, and put JS towards the end, as possible. Steve Souders has already given a definitive answer but...I wonder whether there's an issue with both Sam's original test and Josh's repeat of it.Both tests appear to have been performed on low latency connections where setting up the TCP connection will have a trivial cost.How this affects the result of the test I'm not sure and I'd want to look at the waterfalls for the tests over a 'normal' latency connection but...The first file downloaded should get the connection used for the html page, and the second file downloaded will get the new connection. (Flushing the  early alters that dynamic, but it's not being done here)In newer browsers the second TCP connection is opened speculatively so the connection overhead is reduced / goes away, in older browsers this isn't true and the second connection will have the overhead of being opened.Quite how/if this affects the outcome of the tests I'm not sure.I think this wont be true for all the cases. Because css will download parallel but js cant. Consider for the same case,Instead of having single css, take 2 or 3 css files and try it out these ways,1) css..css..js\n2) css..js..css\n3) js..css..cssI'm sure css..css..js will give better result than all others. We have to keep in mind that new browsers have worked on their Javascript engines, their parsers and so on, optimizing common code and markup problems in a way that problems experienced in ancient browsers such as <=IE8 are no longer relevant, not only with regards to markup but also to use of JavaScript variables, element selectors etc. \nI can see in the not so distant future a situation where technology has reached a point where performance is not really an issue anymore.Personally, I would not place too much emphasis on such \"folk wisdom.\"  What may have been true in the past might well not be true now.  I would assume that all of the operations relating to a web-page's interpretation and rendering are fully asynchronous (\"fetching\" something and \"acting upon it\" are two entirely different things that might be being handled by different threads, etc.), and in any case entirely beyond your control or your concern.I'd put CSS references in the \"head\" portion of the document, along with any references to external scripts.  (Some scripts may demand to be placed in the body, and if so, oblige them.)Beyond that ... if you observe that \"this seems to be faster/slower than that, on this/that browser,\" treat this observation as an interesting but irrelevant curiosity and don't let it influence your design decisions.  Too many things change too fast.  (Anyone want to lay any bets on how many minutes it will be before the Firefox team comes out with yet another interim-release of their product?  Yup, me neither.)"},

I have the following structure, and this rule fails as mentioned in the comments:How can I target the first child with class red?This is one of the most well-known examples of authors misunderstanding how :first-child works. Introduced in CSS2, the :first-child pseudo-class represents the very first child of its parent. That's it. There's a very common misconception that it picks up whichever child element is the first to match the conditions specified by the rest of the compound selector. Due to the way selectors work (see here for an explanation), that is simply not true.Selectors level 3 introduces a :first-of-type pseudo-class, which represents the first element among siblings of its element type. This answer explains, with illustrations, the difference between :first-child and :first-of-type. However, as with :first-child, it does not look at any other conditions or attributes. In HTML, the element type is represented by the tag name. In the question, that type is p.Unfortunately, there is no similar :first-of-class pseudo-class for matching the first child element of a given class. One workaround that Lea Verou and I came up with for this (albeit totally independently) is to first apply your desired styles to all your elements with that class:... then \"undo\" the styles for elements with the class that come after the first one, using the general sibling combinator ~ in an overriding rule:Now only the first element with class=\"red\" will have a border.Here's an illustration of how the rules are applied:As a bonus, although it was introduced in Selectors 3, the general sibling combinator is actually pretty well-supported by IE7 and newer, unlike :first-of-type and :nth-of-type() which are only supported by IE9 onward. If you need good browser support, you're in luck.In fact, the fact that the sibling combinator is the only important component in this technique, and it has such amazing browser support, makes this technique very versatile — you can adapt it for filtering elements by other things, besides class selectors:Note that in order for this to work, you will need to know in advance what the default styles will be for your other sibling elements so you can override the first rule. Additionally, since this involves overriding rules in CSS, you can't achieve the same thing with a single selector for use with the Selectors API, or Selenium's CSS locators.It's worth mentioning that Selectors 4 introduces an extension to the :nth-child() notation (originally an entirely new pseudo-class called :nth-match()), which will allow you to use something like :nth-child(1 of .red) in lieu of a hypothetical .red:first-of-class. Being a relatively recent proposal, there aren't enough interoperable implementations for it to be usable in production sites yet. Hopefully this will change soon. In the meantime, the workaround I've suggested should work for most cases.Keep in mind that this answer assumes that the question is looking for every first child element that has a given class. There is neither a pseudo-class nor even a generic CSS solution for the nth match of a complex selector across the entire document — whether a solution exists depends heavily on the document structure. jQuery provides :eq(), :first, :last and more for this purpose, but note again that they function very differently from :nth-child() et al. Using the Selectors API, you can either use document.querySelector() to obtain the very first match:Or use document.querySelectorAll() with an indexer to pick any specific match:Although the .red:nth-of-type(1) solution in the original accepted answer by Philip Daubmeier works (which was originally written by Martyn but deleted since), it does not behave the way you'd expect it to.For example, if you only wanted to select the p in your original markup:... then you can't use .red:first-of-type (equivalent to .red:nth-of-type(1)), because each element is the first (and only) one of its type (p and div respectively), so both will be matched by the selector.When the first element of a certain class is also the first of its type, the pseudo-class will work, but this happens only by coincidence. This behavior is demonstrated in Philip's answer. The moment you stick in an element of the same type before this element, the selector will fail. Taking the updated markup:Applying a rule with .red:first-of-type will work, but once you add another p without the class:... the selector will immediately fail, because the first .red element is now the second p element.The :first-child selector is intended, like the name says, to select the first child of a parent tag. The children have to be embedded in the same parent tag. Your exact example will work (Just tried it here):Maybe you have nested your tags in different parent tags? Are your tags of class red really the first tags under the parent?Notice also that this doesnt only apply to the first such tag in the whole document, but everytime a new parent is wrapped around it, like:first and third will be red then.Update:I dont know why martyn deleted his answer, but he had the solution, the :nth-of-type selector:Credits to Martyn. More infos for example here. Be aware that this is a CSS 3 selector, therefore not all browsers will recognize it (e.g. IE8 or older).The correct answer is:Part I: If element is first to its parent and has class \"red\", it shall get border.\nPart II: If \".red\" element is not first to its parent, but is immediately following an element without class \".red\", it shall also deserve the honor of said border.Fiddle or it didn't happen.Philip Daubmeier's answer, while accepted, is not correct - see attached fiddle.\nBoltClock's answer would work, but unnecessarily defines and overwrites styles\n(particularly an issue where it otherwise would inherit a different border - you don't want to declare other to border:none)EDIT:\nIn the event that you have \"red\" following non-red several times, each \"first\" red will get the border. To prevent that, one would need to use BoltClock's answer. See fiddleyou could use first-of-type or nth-of-type(1)The above answers are too complex. This will select the first-type of class. MDN SourceTo match your selector, the element must have a class name of red and must be the first child of its parent.Since the other answers cover what's wrong with it, I'll try the other half, how to fix it.  Unfortunately, I don't know that you have a CSS only solution here, at least not that I can think of.  There are some other options though....I got this one in my project.According to your updated problemhow about  This will select class home, then the element span and finally all .red elements that are placed immediately after span elements.  Reference: http://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css_selectors.aspYou could use nth-of-type(1) but be sure that site doesn't need to support IE7 etc, if this is the case use jQuery to add body class then find element via IE7 body class then the element name, then add in the nth-child styling to it.You can change your code to something like this to get it workThis does the job for youHere is a CSS reference from SnoopCode about that.I am using below CSS to have a background image for the list ul liTry this :For some reason none of the above answers seemed to be addressing the case of the real first and only first child of the parent.All the above answers will fail if you want to apply the style to only the first class child within this code.Try This Simple and EffectiveI believe that using relative selector + for selecting elements placed immediately after, works here the best (as few suggested before).It is also possible for this case to use this selectorbut this is element selector not the class one.

Unfortunately, the problem comes down to a technical issue: css :after and :before rules aren't part of the DOM, and therefore can't be altered using jQuery's DOM methods.There are ways to manipulate these elements using JavaScript and/or CSS workarounds; which one you use depends on your exact requirements.I'm going to start with what's widely considered the \"best\" approach:In this approach, you've already created a class in your CSS with a different :after or :before style. Place this \"new\" class later in your stylesheet to make sure it overrides:Then you can easily add or remove this class using jQuery (or vanilla JavaScript):It's possible to use JavaScript to add styles directly to the document stylesheet, including :after and :before styles. jQuery doesn't provide a convenient shortcut, but fortunately the JS isn't that complicated:.addRule() and the related .insertRule() methods are fairly well-supported today. As a variation, you can also use jQuery to add an entirely new stylesheet to the document, but the necessary code isn't any cleaner:If we're talking about \"manipulating\" the values, not just adding to them, we can also read the existing :after or :before styles using a different approach:We can replace document.querySelector('p') with $('p')[0] when using jQuery, for slightly shorter code.You can also to use attr() in your CSS to read a particular DOM attribute. (If a browser supports :before, it supports attr() as well.) By combining this with content: in some carefully-prepared CSS, we can change the content (but not other properties, like margin or color) of :before and :after dynamically:JS:This can be combined with the second technique if the CSS can't be prepared ahead of time:Although they are rendered by browsers through CSS as if they were like other real DOM elements, pseudo-elements themselves are not part of the DOM, because pseudo-elements, as the name implies, are not real elements, and therefore you can't select and manipulate them directly with jQuery (or any JavaScript APIs for that matter, not even the Selectors API). This applies to any pseudo-elements whose styles you're trying to modify with a script, and not just ::before and ::after.You can only access pseudo-element styles directly at runtime via the CSSOM (think window.getComputedStyle()), which is not exposed by jQuery beyond .css(), a method that doesn't support pseudo-elements either.You can always find other ways around it, though, for example:You can't select pseudo elements in jQuery because they are not part of DOM.\nBut you can add an specific class to the father element and control its pseudo elements in CSS.EXAMPLEIn jQuery:In CSS:We can also rely on custom properties (aka CSS variables) in order to manipulate pseudo-element.

If the image is part of the content such as a logo or diagram or person (real person, not stock photo people) then use the <img /> tag plus alt attribute. For everything else there's CSS background images.The other time to use CSS background images is when doing image-replacement of text eg. paragraphs/headers.I'm surprised no one's mentioned this yet: CSS transitions.You can natively transition a div's background image:This saves any kind of JavaScript or jQuery animation to fade an <img/>'s src.More information about transitions on MDN.Above answers considers only Design aspect . I am listing it in SEO aspects.When to use <img /> When to use CSS background-imageAs i will use them based on these reasons. These are Good practices of Search Engine Optimization of Images.Browsers aren't always set to print background images by default; if you intend to have people print your page :)If you have your CSS in an external file, then it's often convenient to display an image that's used frequently across the site (such as a header image) as a background image, because then you have the flexibility to change the image later.For example, say you have the following HTML:...and CSS:A few days later, you change the location of the image. All you have to do is update the CSS:Otherwise, you'd have to update the src attribute of the appropriate <img> tag in every HTML file (assuming you're not using a server-side scripting language or CMS to automate the process).Also background images are useful if you don't want the user to be able to save the image (although I haven't ever needed to do this).About the same as sanchothefat's answer, but from a different aspect. I always ask myself: if I would completely remove the stylesheets from the website, do the remaining elements only belong to the content? If so, I did my job well.Some answers overcomplicate the scenario here. This is a dead simple situation.Just answer to this question every time you'd like to place an image:Is this part of the content or part of the design?If you can't answer this, you probably don't know what you're doing or what you want to do!Also, DO NOT consider beside the two technique, just because you'd wish to be \"printer friendly\" or not. Also DO NOT hide content from a SEO point of view with CSS. If you find yourself managing your content in CSS files, you shot yourself in the leg. This is just a trivial decision of what is content or not. Every other aspect should be ignored.I would add another two arguments:One more benefit from using the <IMG> tag is related to SEO - i.e. you can provide additional information about the image in the ALT attribute of the image tag, while there's no way to provide such information when specifying the image through CSS and in that case only the image file name may be indexed by search engines. The ALT attribute definitely gives the <IMG> tag SEO advantage over the CSS approach. That's why according to me it is better to specify the images you want to rank well in the image search results (e.g. Google Image Search) using the <IMG> tag.Foreground = img.Background = CSS background.Use background images only when necessary e.g. containers with image that tiles.One of the major PROS by using IMAGES is that it is better for SEO.Using a background image, you need to absolutely specify the dimensions. This can be a significant problem if you don't actually know them in advance or cannot determine them. A big problem with <img /> is overlays. What if I want an CSS inner shadow on my image (box-shadow:inset 0 0 5px rgb(0,0,0,.5))? In this case, since <img /> can't have child elements, you need to use positioning and add empty elements which equates to useless markup.In conclusion, it's quite situational.A couple of other scenarios where background-image should be used:Use CSS background-image in a case of multiple skins or versions of design. Javascript can be used to dynamically change a class of an element, which will force it to render a different image. With an IMG tag, it may be more tricky.Here's a technical consideration: will the image be generated dynamically? It tends to be a lot easier to generate the <img> tag in HTML than to try to dynamically edit a CSS property.What about the size of the image? If I use the img tag, the browser scales the image. If I use css background, the browser just cuts a chunk from the larger image.In regards to animating images using CSS TranslateX/Y (The proper way to animate html) - If you do a Chrome Timeline recording of CSS background-images being animated vs IMG tags being animated you will see the paint times are drastically shorter for the CSS background-images. There's another reason! If you have a responsive design and want to split usage of low, medium, and high-res images for devices through media queries, you should use backgrounds as well.Also, i have a gallery section which has inconsistent picture sizes so even though those images are obviously considered content, I use background images and center them in divs with a set size. This is similar to what facebook does in their albums..img is an html tag for a reason, therefore it should be used. For referencing or to illustrate things, people e.g: in articles.Also if the image has a meaning or has to be clickable an img is better than a css background. For all other situation, I think, a css background can be used. Although, it is a subject that needs to be discussed over and over.Web Student from Paris, FranceJust a small one to add, you should use the img tag if you want users to be able to 'right click' and 'save-image'/'save-picture', so if you intend to provide the image as a resource for others.Using background image will (as far as I'm aware on most browsers) disable the option to save the image directly.A small input, \nI have had problems with responsive images slowing down the rendering on iphone for up to a minute, even with small images:But when switching to using background images the problem went away, this is only viable if targeting newer browsers.IMG load first because the src is in the html file itself whereas in the case of background-image the source is mentioned in stylesheet so the image loads after the stylesheet loaded, delaying the loading of the webpage.HTML is for content and CSS is for design. Is the image necessary and does it need to be picked up by screen readers? If the answer is yes, then put the image in the HTML. If it is purely for styling, then you can use the background-image property in CSS to inject the image. Just as a lot of people here have already mentioned, you can then use a pseudo element on the image if you like.Also note that most search engine spiders don't index CSS background images therefore the background images will be ignored and you won't be able to get any traffic from search engines (no SEO benefit in short).Where as all images defined with  tags are indexed (unless manually excluded) and can bring in traffic from search engines if their title/alt attributes and filenames are optimized properly (w.r.t some keyword).You can use IMG tags if you want the images to be fluid and scale to different screen sizes. For me these images are mostly part of the content. For most elements that are not part of the content, I use CSS sprites to keep the download size minimal unless I really want to animate icons etc.I use image instead of background-image when i want to make them 100% stretchable which supported in most browsers.If you want to add an image only for the special content on the page or for only one page the you should use IMG tag and if you want to put image on more than one pages then you should use  CSS Background Image.Another background-image PRO: Background-images for <ul>/<ol> lists.Use background images if they are part of the overall-design and are repeated on multiple pages. Preferably in background sprite form for optimization.Use  tags for all images that are not part of the overall design, and are most likely placed once, like specific images for articles, people, and important images that deserve to be added to google images.** The only repeated image that I enclose in a <img> tag is the site/company logo. Because people tend to click it to go to the homepage, thus you wrap it with an <a> tag."},

If you look at utilities.less you will see very few utility classes in Bootstrap, the reason being that this kind of class is generally frowned upon, and is recommended to be used for either:\n a) prototyping and development - so you can quickly build out your pages, then remove the pull-right and pull-left classes in favor of applying floats to more semantic classes or to the elements themselves, or \n b) when it's clearly more practical than a more semantic solution. In your case, by your question it looks like you wish to have certain text align on the right in your table, but not all of it. Semantically, it would be better to do something like (I'm just going to make up a few classes here, except for the default bootstrap class, .table): And just apply the text-align: left or text-align: right declarations to the price-value and price-label classes (or whatever classes work for you). The problem with applying align-right as a class, is that if you want to refactor your tables you will have to redo the markup and the styles. If you use semantic classes you might be able to get away with refactoring only the CSS content. Plus, if are taking the time to apply a class to an element, it's best practice to try to assign semantic value to that class so that the markup is easier to navigate for other programmers (or you three months later).One way to think of it is this: when you pose the question \"What is this td for?\", you will not get clarification from the answer \"align-right\".Bootstrap 2.3 has utility classes text-left, text-right, and text-center, but they do not work in table cells. Until Bootstrap 3.0 is released (where they have fixed the issue) and I am able to make the switch, I have added this to my site CSS that is loaded after bootstrap.css:Just add a \"custom\" stylesheet which is loaded after Bootstrap´s stylesheet. So the class definitions are overloaded.In this stylesheet declare the alignment as follows:Now you are able to use the \"common\" alignment conventions for td and th elements.I guess because CSS already has text-align:right, AFAIK, Bootstrap doesn't have a special class for it.Bootstrap does have \"pull-right\" for floating divs, etc. to the right.Bootstrap 2.3 just came out and added text alignment styles:Bootstrap 2.3 released (2013-02-07)Bootstrap 4 is coming! The utility classes made familiar in Bootstrap 3.x are now break-point enabled. The default breakpoints are: xs, sm, md, lg and xl, so these text alignment classes look something like .text-[breakpoint]-[alignnment].Important: As of writing this, Bootstrap 4 is only in Alpha 2. These classes and how they're used are subject to change without notice.Bootstrap text alignment in v3.3.5:CodePen exampleThe following lines of code are working properly. You can assign the classes like text-center, left or right, The text will align accordingly.Here there isn't any need to create any external class. These are the Bootstrap classes and have their own property.You can use this CSS below:The .text-align class is totally valid and more usable than having a .price-label and .price-value which are of no use any more.I recommend going 100% with a custom utility class calledI like to do some magic, but that is up to you, like something:Expanding on David's answer, I just add a simple class to augment Bootstrap like this:Ow, with the release of Bootstrap 3, you can use the classes of text-center for center alignment, text-left for left alignment, text-right for right alignment and text-justify for a justified alignment.Bootstrap is a very simple frontend framework to work with, once you utilize it.

So use with care.Of course, there's a good argument that @Nick Craver's method is easier/wiser.The above, attr() approach modified slightly to preserve the original style string/properties, and modified as suggested by falko in a comment:I think I've found a real solution. I've made it into a new function:jQuery.style(name, value, priority);You can use it to get values with .style('name') just like .css('name'), get the CSSStyleDeclaration with .style(), and also set values - with the ability to specify the priority as 'important'. See this.Here's the output:See this for examples of how to read and set the CSS values. My issue was that I had already set !important for the width in my CSS to avoid conflicts with other theme CSS, but any changes I made to the width in jQuery would be unaffected since they would be added to the style attribute.For setting with the priority using the setProperty function, This Article says there is support for IE 9+ and all other browsers. I have tried with IE 8 and it has failed, which is why I built support for it in my functions (see above). It will work on all other browsers using setProperty, but it will need my custom code to work in < IE 9.You can set the width directly using .width() like this:Updated for comments:\nYou have this option as well, but it'll replace all css on the element, so not sure it's any more viable:Note:\nUsing Chrome may return an error such as:Changing the line to use the .removeProperty function such as to elem[0].style.removeProperty('width'); fixed the issue.David Thomas’s answer describes a way to use $('#elem').attr('style', …), but warns that using it will delete previously-set styles in the style attribute. Here is a way of using attr() without that problem:As a function:Here is a JS Bin demo.After reading other answers and experimenting, this is what works for me:This doesn't work in IE 8 and under, though.You can do this:Using \"cssText\" as the property name and whatever you want added to the CSS as its value.You can achieve this in two ways:There's no need to go to the complexity of @AramKocharyan's answer, nor the need to insert any style tags dynamically.Just overwrite style, but you don't have to parse anything, why would you?\nCan't use removeProperty(), because it won't remove !important rules in Chrome.\nCan't use element.style[property] = '', because it only accepts camelCase in Firefox.\nYou could probably make this shorter with jQuery, but this vanilla function will run on modern browsers, Internet Explorer 8, etc.Here is what I did after encountering this problem...This solution doesn't override any of the previous styles, it just applies the one you need:If it is not so relevant and since you're dealing with one element which is #elem, you can change its id to something else and style it as you wish...And in your CSS:Instead of using the css() function try the addClass() function:The easiest and best solution for this problem from me was to simply use addClass() instead of .css() or .attr().For example:$('#elem').addClass('importantClass');And in your CSS file:FYI, it doesn't work because jQuery doesn't support it. There was a ticket filed on 2012 (#11173 $(elem).css(\"property\", \"value !important\") fails) that was eventually closed as WONTFIX.We need first to remove the previous style. I remove it using a regular expression. Here is an example for changing color:An alternative way to append style in head:This appends style after all your CSS files so it will have higher priority than other CSS files and will be applied.May be it look's like this:I think it works OK and can overwrite any other CSS before (this: DOM element):Do it like this:This solution will leave all the computed javascript and add the important tag into the element:\nYou can do (Ex if you need to set the width with the important tag)I had a similar situation, but I used .find() after struggling with .closest() for a long time with many variations.Working: http://jsfiddle.net/fx4mbp6c/It may or may not be appropriate for your situation but you can use CSS selectors for a lot of these type of situations. If, for example you wanted of the 3rd and 6th instances of .cssText to have a different width you could write:Or:I would assume you tried it without adding !important?Inline CSS (which is how JavaScript adds styling) overrides the stylesheet CSS. I'm pretty sure that's the case even when the stylesheet CSS rule has !important.Another question (maybe a stupid question but must be asked.):  Is the element you are trying to work on display:block; or display:inline-block;?Not knowing your expertise in CSS...  inline elements don't always behave as you would expect.We can use setProperty or cssText to add !important to a DOM element using JavaScript.Example 1:Example 2:Most of these answers are now outdated, IE7 support is not an issue.The best way to do this that supports IE11+ and all modern browsers is:Or if you want, you can create a small jQuery plugin that does this.\nThis plugin closely matches jQuery's own css() method in the parameters it supports:Example jsfiddle here.I also discovered that certain elements or add-on's (like Bootstrap) have some special class cases where they do not play well with !important or other work-arounds like .addClass/.removeClass, and thus you have to to toggle them on/off. For example, if you use something like <table class=\"table-hover\">the only way to successfully modify elements like colors of rows is to toggle the table-hover class on/off, like this$(your_element).closest(\"table\").toggleClass(\"table-hover\"); Hopefully this work-around will be helpful to someone! :)I had the same problem trying to change a text color of a menu-item when \"event\". The best way I found when I had this same problem was:First step: Create, in your CSS, a new class with this purpose, for example:Last step: Apply this class using the addClass method as follows:Problem solved.The safest workaround to this is to add a class and then do the magic in CSS :-), addClass() and removeClass() should do the work.https://jsfiddle.net/xk6Ut/256/An alternative approach is  dynamically creating and updating CSS class in JavaScript.

If the float property supported a value of 'bottom' it seems that would do the trick, but unfortunately, it doesn't.Likely not.Assign position:relative to #container, and then position:absolute; bottom:0; to #copyright.Actually, the accepted answer by @User will only work if the window is tall and the content is short. But if the content is tall and the window is short, it will put the copyright info over the page content, and then scrolling down to see the content will leave you with a floating copyright notice. That makes this solution useless for most pages (like this page, actually).The most common way of doing this is the \"CSS sticky footer\" approach demonstrated, or a slightly slimmer variation. This approach works great -- IF you have a fixed height footer.If you need a variable height footer that will appear at the bottom of the window if the content is too short, and at the bottom of the content if the window is too short, what do you do?Swallow your pride and use a table.For example:Try it out. This will work for any window size, for any amount of content, for any size footer, on every browser... even IE6.If you're cringing at the thought of using a table for layout, take a second to ask yourself why. CSS was supposed to make our lives easier -- and it has, overall -- but the fact is that even after all these years, it's still a broken, counter-intuitive mess. It can't solve every problem. It's incomplete.Tables aren't cool, but at least for now, they are sometimes the best way to solve a design problem.In supported browsers, you can use the following:Example HereThe solution above is probably more flexible, however, here is an alternative solution:Example HereAs a side note, you may want to add vendor prefixes for additional support.Yes you can do this without absolute positioning and without using tables (which screw with markup and such).DEMO\nThis is tested to work on IE>7, chrome, FF & is a really easy thing to add to your existing layout.It effectively does what float:bottom would, even accounting for the issue pointed out in @Rick Reilly's answer!Its an old question, but this is a unique approach that can help in several cases.check out that Working FiddleBecause normal flow is 'top-to-bottom' we can't simply ask the #copyright div to stick to the bottom of his parent without absolutely positioning of some sort, But if we wanted the #copyright div to stick to the top of his parent, it will be very simple - because this is the normal flow way.So we will use this in our advantage.\nwe will change the order of the divs in the HTML, now the #copyright div is at the top, and the content follow it right away.\nwe also make the content div stretch all the way (using pseudo elements and clearing techniques)now it's just a matter of inverting that order back in the view. that can be easily done with CSS transform.We rotate the container by 180deg, and now: up-is-down. (and we inverse back the content to look normal again)If we want to have a scroolbar within the content area, we need to apply a little bit more of CSS magic. as can be showed Here [in that example, the content is below a header - but its the same idea]Create another container div for the elements above #copyright. Just above copyright add a new div:\n   <div style=\"clear:both;\"></div>\nIt will force the footer to be under everything else, just like in the case of using relative positioning (bottom:0px;).Try this;While none of the answers provided here seemed to apply or work in my particular case, I came across this article which provides this neat solution :I find it very useful for applying responsive design for mobile display without having to reorder all the html code of a website, setting body itself as a table.Note that only the first table-footer-group or table-header-group will be rendered as such : if there are more than one, the others will be rendered as table-row-group.You can indeed align the box to the bottom without using position:absolute if you know the height of the #container using the text alignment feature of inline-block elements.Here you can see it in action.This is the code:Just set element child to position: relative and than move it top: 100% (that's the 100% height of the parent) and stick to bottom of parent by transform: translateY(-100%) (that's -100% of the height of the child).BenefitSBut still just workaround :(Don't forget prefixes for the older browser.CodePen link here.Since the usage of CSS Grid is increasing, I would like to suggest align-self to the element that is inside a grid container.align-self can contain any of the values: end, self-end, flex-end for the following example.If you want it to \"stick\" to the bottom, regardless of the height of container, then absolute positioning is the way to go. Of course, if the copyright element is the last in the container it'll always be at the bottom anyway.Can you expand on your question? Explain exactly what you're trying to do (and why you don't want to use absolute positioning)?Also, if there's stipulations with using position:absolute; or position:relative;, you can always try padding parent div or putting a margin-top:x;. Not a very good method in most cases, but it may come in handy in some cases.Maybe this helps someone: You can always place the div outside the other div and then push it upwards using negative margin:Don't wanna use \"position:absolute\" for sticky footer at bottom. Then you can do this way:If you do not know the height of child block:http://jsbin.com/ULUXIFon/3/editIf you know the height of the child block add the child block then add padding-top/margin-top:Just because this hasn't been mentioned at all, what usually works well in situations like yours: Placing the copyright-div after the container-divYou would only have to format the copyright-div in a similar way to the other container (same overall width, centering, etc.), and all is fine.CSS:HTML:The only time this might not be ideal is when your container-div is declared with height:100%, and the user would need to scroll down to see the copyright. But even still you could work around (e.g. margin-top:-20px - when the height of your copyright element is 20px).Aside: I know the OP asked for a solution that \"... sticks to the bottom of the 'container' div ...\", and not something under it, but come on, people are looking for good solutions here, and this is one!Here is an approach targeted at making an element with a known height and width (at least approximately) float to the right and stay at the bottom, while behaving as an inline element to the other elements. It is focused at the bottom-right because you can place it easily in any other corner through other methods.I needed to make a navigation bar which would have the actual links at the bottom right, and random sibling elements, while ensuring that the bar itself stretched properly, without disrupting the layout. I used a \"shadow\" element to occupy the navigation bar's links' space and added it at the end of the container's child nodes.There is nothing called float:bottom in CSS. The best way is using positioning in such cases:For those only have one child in the container, you can use the table-cell and vertical-align approach which worked reliably for positioning a single div at the bottom of its parent.Note that using table-footer-group as other answers mentioned will break the height calculation of parent table.According: w3schools.comSo you need to position the parent element with something either relative or absolute, etc and position the desired element to absolute and latter set bottom to 0.Div of style, position:absolute;bottom:5px;width:100%; is working, \nBut it required more scrollup situation."},

Rather than try to remove scrollbars (which we all know is not possible) we can avoid scrolling (perfectly feasible) and scroll within the elements that we make and have more control over.Create a div with overflow hidden. Detect when the user attempts to scroll, but is unable to because we've disabled the browsers ability to scroll with overflow: hidden.. and instead move the content up using JavaScript when this occurs. Thereby creating our own scrolling without the browsers default scrolling or use a plugin like iScroll.For the sake of being thorough; all the vendor specific ways of manipulating scroll-bars:*These properties were never part of the CSS specification, nor were they ever approved or vendor prefixed, but they work in Internet Explorer and Konqueror. These can also be set locally in the user style sheet for each application. In Internet Explorer you find it under the \"Accessibility\" tab, in Konqueror under the \"Stylesheets\" tab.As of Internet Explorer 8 these properties were vendor prefixed by Microsoft, but they were still never approved by W3C.Internet Explorer makes scroll available which sets whether or not to disable or enable scroll bars; it can also be used to get the value of the position of the scroll bars.With Microsoft Internet Explorer 6 and later, when you use the !DOCTYPE declaration to specify standards-compliant mode, this attribute applies to the HTML element. When standards-compliant mode is not specified, as with earlier versions of Internet Explorer, this attribute applies to the BODY element, NOT the HTML element.It's also worth noting that when working with .NET the ScrollBar class in System.Windows.Controls.Primitives in the Presentation framework is responsible for rendering the scrollbars.http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ie/ms534393(v=vs.85).aspxWebKit extensions related to scroll-bar customization are:These can each be combined with additional pseudo-selectors:Examples of these combinationsMozilla does have some extensions for manipulating the scroll-bars, but they are all recommended not to be used.This is not really useful as far as I know, but it's worth noting that the attribute which controls whether or not scrollbars are displayed in Firefox is (reference link):As has been previously mentioned in some other answers, here is an illustration which is sufficiently self-explanatory.Just because I'm curious, I wanted to learn about the origin of scrollbars, and these are the best references I found.In an HTML5 specification draft, the seamless attribute was defined to prevent scroll-bars from appearing in iFrames so that they could be blended with surrounding content on a page. Though this element does not appear in the latest revision.The scrollbar BarProp object is a child of the window object and represents the user interface element that contains a scrolling mechanism, or some similar interface concept. window.scrollbars.visible will return true if the scroll bars are visible.The History API also includes features for scroll restoration on page navigation to persist the scroll position on page load.window.history.scrollRestoration can be used to check the status of scrollrestoration or change its status (appending =\"auto\"/\"manual\". Auto is the default value. Changing it to manual means that you as the developer will take ownership of any scroll changes that may be required when a user traverses the app's history. If you need to, you can keep track of the scroll position as you push history entries with history.pushState().You can accomplish this with a wrapper div that has its overflow hidden, and the inner div set to auto.To remove the inner div's scroll bar, you can pull it out of the outer div's viewport by applying a negative margin to the inner div. Then apply equal padding to the inner div so that the content stays in view.JSFiddleThis works for me with simple CSS properties:For older versions of Firefox, use: overflow: -moz-scrollbars-none;Here's my solution, which theoretically covers all modern browsers:html can be replaced with any element you want to hide the scrollbar of.Note: I've skimmed the other 19 answers to see if the code I'm posting has already been covered, and it seems like no single answer sums up the situation as it stands in 2019, although plenty of them go into excellent detail.

I've tested it in Firefox, Webkit, and Internet Explorer 8.Use the background-size attribute  in CSS3:EDIT: Modernizr supports detection of background-size support. You can use a JavaScript workaround written to work however you need it and load it dynamically when there is no support. This will keep the code maintainable without resorting to intrusive CSS hacks for certain browsers.Personally I use a script to deal with it using jQuery, its an adaption of imgsizer. As most designs I do now use width %'s for fluid layouts across devices there is a slight adaptation to one of the loops (accounting for sizes that aren't always 100%):EDIT:\nYou may also be interested in jQuery CSS3 Finaliz[s]e.Try the article background-size. If you use all of the following, it will work in most browsers except Internet Explorer.Not currently. It will be available in CSS 3, but it will take some time until it's implemented in most browsers.Works in:In addition you can try this for an ie solutionCredit to this article by Chris Coyier\nhttp://css-tricks.com/perfect-full-page-background-image/In one word: no. The only way to stretch an image is with the <img> tag. You'll have to be creative.This used to be true in 2008, when the answer was written. Today modern browsers support background-size which solves this problem. Beware that IE8 doesn't support it.Define \"stretch and scale\"...If you've got a bitmap format, it's generally not great (graphically speaking) to stretch it and pull it about.  You can use repeatable patterns to give the illusion of the same effect.  For instance if you have a gradient that gets lighter towards the bottom of the page, then you would use a graphic that's a single pixel wide and the same height as your container (or preferably larger to account for scaling) and then tile it across the page.  Likewise, if the gradient ran across the page, it would be one pixel high and wider than your container and repeated down the page.Normally to give the illusion of it stretching to fill the container when the container grows or shrinks, you make the image larger than the container.  Any overlap would not be displayed outside the bounds of the container.If you want an effect that relies on something like a box with curved edges, then you would stick the left side of your box to the left side of your container with enough overlap that (within reason) no matter how large the container, it never runs out of background and then you layer an image of the right side of the box with curved edges and position it on the right of the container.  Thus as the container shrinks or grows, the curved box effect appears to shrink or grow with it - it doesn't in fact, but it gives the illusion that is what's happening.As for really making the image shrink and grow with the container, you would need to use some layering tricks to make the image appear to function as a background and some javascript to resize it with the container.  There's no current way of doing this with CSS...If you're using vector graphics, you're way outside my realm of expertise I'm afraid.This is what I've made of it. In the stretch class, I simply changed the height to auto. This way your background picture has always got the same size as the width of the screen and the height will allways have the right size.Add a background-attachment line:I would like to point out that this is equivalent to doing:Another great solution for this is Srobbin's Backstretch which can be applied to the body or any element on the page - http://srobbin.com/jquery-plugins/backstretch/Try thishttp://jsfiddle.net/5LZ55/4/An additional tip for SolidSmile's cheat is to scale (the proportionate re-sizing) by setting a width and using auto for height.Ex: Use the border-image : yourimage property to set your image and scale it upto the entire border of your screen or window ."},

I tried using margin-top to fix it, but I think this is not a good solution for the responsive design.You still can use a custom class when you need it:BootplyUsing inline-block adds extra space between blocks if you let a real space in your code (like ...</div> </div>...). This extra space breaks our grid if column sizes add up to 12:Here, we've got extra spaces between <div class=\"[...] col-lg-2\"> and <div class=\"[...] col-lg-10\"> (a carriage return and 2 tabs/8 spaces). And so...Let's kick this extra space!!Notice the seemingly useless comments <!-- ... -->? They are important -- without them, the whitespace between the <div> elements will take up space in the layout, breaking the grid system.Note: the Bootply has been updatedWith the advent of the CSS Flexible Box, many of web designers' nightmares1 have been resolved. One of the most hacky ones, the vertical alignment. Now it is possible even in unknown heights.Flexible Box (or in short, Flexbox), is a new layout system that is specifically designed for layout purposes. The specification states:How can it help in this case? Well, let's see.Using Twitter Bootstrap we have .rows having some .col-*s. All we need to do is to display the desired .row2 as a flex container box and then align all its flex items (the columns) vertically by align-items property.EXAMPLE HERE (Please read the comments with care)Colored area displays the padding-box of columns.Important note #1: Twitter Bootstrap doesn't specify the width of columns in extra small devices unless you give one of .col-xs-# classes to the columns.Therefore in this particular demo, I have used .col-xs-* classes in order for columns to be displayed properly in mobile mode, because it specifies the width of the column explicitly.But alternatively you could switch off the Flexbox layout simply by changing display: flex; to display: block; in specific screen sizes. For instance:Or you could specify .vertical-align only on specific screen sizes like so:In that case, I'd go with @KevinNelson's approach.Important note #2: Vendor prefixes omitted due to brevity. Flexbox syntax has been changed during the time. The new written syntax won't work on older versions of web browsers (but not that old as Internet Explorer 9! Flexbox is supported on Internet Explorer 10 and later).This means you should also use vendor-prefixed properties like display: -webkit-box and so on in production mode.If you click on \"Toggle Compiled View\" in the Demo, you'll see the prefixed version of CSS declarations (thanks to Autoprefixer).As you see in the previous demo, columns (the flex items) are no longer as high as their container (the flex container box. i.e. the .row element).This is because of using center value for align-items property. The default value is stretch so that the items can fill the entire height of the parent element.In order to fix that, you can add display: flex; to the columns as well:EXAMPLE HERE (Again, mind the comments)Colored area displays the padding-box of columns.Last, but not least, notice that the demos and code snippets here are meant to give you a different idea, to provide a modern approach to achieve the goal. Please mind the \"Big Alert\" section if you are going to use this approach in real world websites or applications.For further reading including browser support, these resources would be useful:1. Vertically align an image inside a div with responsive height\n2. It's better to use an additional class in order not to alter Twitter Bootstrap's  default .row.The below code worked for me:Update 2020I know the original question was for Bootstrap 3, but now that Bootstrap 4 has been released, here is some updated guidance on vertical center.Important! Vertical center is relative to the height of the parentNow that Bootstrap 4 is flexbox by default there are many different approaches to vertical alignment using: auto-margins, flexbox utils, or the display utils along with vertical align utils. At first \"vertical align utils\" seems obvious, but these only work with inline and table display elements. Here are some Bootstrap 4 vertical centering options..1 - Vertical Center Using Auto Margins:Another way to vertically center is to use my-auto. This will center the element within its container. For example, h-100 makes the row full height, and my-auto will vertically center the col-sm-12 column.Bootstrap 4 - Vertical center using auto-margins Demomy-auto represents margins on the vertical y-axis and is equivalent to:2 - Vertical Center with Flexbox:Since Bootstrap 4 .row is now display:flex you can simply use align-self-center on any column to vertically center it...or, use align-items-center on the entire .row to vertically center align all col-* in the row...Bootstrap 4 - Vertical center different height columns Demo3 - Vertical Center Using Display Utils:Bootstrap 4 has display utils that can be used for display:table, display:table-cell, display:inline, etc.. These can be used with the vertical alignment utils to align inline, inline-block or table cell elements.Bootstrap 4 - Vertical center using display utils DemoAlso see:\nVertical Align Center in Bootstrap 4Flexbox method on the container of the item(s) to center:Transform translateY method:Display inline method:Demo of Bootstrap 3 centering methodsTry this in the CSS of the div:I thought I'd share my \"solution\" in case it helps anyone else who isn't familiar with the @media queries themselves.Thanks to @HashemQolami's answer, I built some media queries that would work mobile-up like the col-* classes so that I could stack the col-* for mobile but display them vertically-aligned in the center for larger screens, e.g..More complicated layouts that require a different number of columns per screen resolution (e.g. 2 rows for -xs, 3 for -sm, and 4 for -md, etc.) would need some more advanced finagling, but for a simple page with -xs stacked and -sm and larger in rows, this works fine.Following the accepted answer, if you do not wish to customize the markup, for separation of concerns or simply because you use a CMS, the following solution works fine:The limitation here is that you cannot inherit font size from the parent element because the row sets the font size to 0 in order to remove white space.I prefer this method as per David Walsh Vertical center CSS:The transform isn't essential; it just finds the center a little more accurately. Internet Explorer 8 may be slightly less centered as a result, but it is still not bad - Can I use - Transforms 2d.This is my solution. Just add this class to your CSS content.Then your HTML would look like this:I just did this and it does what I want it to do.And now my page looks likeI genuinely find the following code works using Chrome and not other browsers than the currently selected answer:You may need to amend the heights (specifically on .v-center) and remove/change div on div[class*='col-'] for your needs.I ran into this same issue. In my case I did not know the height of the outer container, but this is how I fixed it:First set the height for your html and body elements so that they are 100%. This is important! Without this, the html and body elements will simply inherit the height of their children.Then I had an outer container class with:And lastly the inner container with class:HTML is as simple as:This is all you need to vertically align contents. Check it out in fiddle:If you are using the Less version of Bootstrap, and compiling into CSS yourself, you can use some utility classes to use with Bootstrap classes.I've found these to work fantastically well where I want to preserve the responsiveness and configurability of the Bootstrap grid system (like using -md or -sm), but I want all columns in a given row to all have the same vertical height (so that I can then vertically align their content and have all columns in the row share a common middle).There isn't any need for table and table-cells. It can be achieved easily using transform.Example: http://codepen.io/arvind/pen/QNbwyMCode:I elaborated a bit on zessx's answer, in order to make it easier to use when mixing different column sizes on different screen sizes.If you use Sass, you can add this to your scss-file:Which generates the following CSS (that you can use directly in your stylesheets, if you are not using Sass):Now you can use it on your responsive columns like this:Flex behaviors are natively supported since Bootstrap 4. Add d-flex align-items-center in the row div. You no longer need to modify your CSS content.Simple example: http://jsfiddle.net/vgks6L74/With your example:\nhttp://jsfiddle.net/7zwtL702/Source: Flex · BootstrapOK, accidentally I've mixed a few solutions, and it finally works now for my layout where I tried to make a 3x3 table with Bootstrap columns on the smallest resolution.Try this,There are several ways you can do it:With Bootstrap 4 (which is in alpha currently) you can use the .align-items-center class. So you can keep the responsive character of Bootstrap.\nWorkes straight away fine for me. See Bootstrap 4 Documentation.HTMLCSSI ran into the same situation where I wanted to align a few div elements vertically in a row and found that Bootstrap classes col-xx-xx applies style to the div as float: left.I had to apply the style on the div elements like style=\"Float:none\" and all my div elements started vertically aligned.

With this you can place the div overtope of the background div without having it's opacity mucked with.Another option is to RGBa. This will allow you to nest your divs and still achieve div specific opacity.The last option is to simply make a semi transparent .png image of the color you want in your desired image editor of choice, set the background-image property to the URL of the image and then you won't have to worry about mucking about with the CSS and losing the capability and organization of a nested div structure.Just make sure to put width and height for the foreground the same with the background, or try to have top, bottom, left and right properties."},

Aside from including the bootstrap 4 validation support we've also made it possible to click anywhere on the input to open the file dialog.The three possible states are un-validated, valid and invalid with the dummy html input tag attribute required set.We introduce only 2 custom classes input-file-dummy and input-file-btn to properly style and wire the desired behaviour. Everything else is standard Bootstrap 4 markup.The dummy input needs to be read only, as per the original example, to prevent the user from changing the input which may only be changed via the open file dialog. Unfortunately validation does not occur on readonly fields so we toggle the editability of the input on focus and blur ( jquery events onfocusin and onfocusout) and ensure that it becomes validatable again once a file is selected.Aside from also making the text field clickable, by triggering the button's click event, the rest of the functionality of populating the dummy field was envisioned by @claviska.Most importantly we don't want the readonly field to jump between grey background and white so we ensure it stays white. The span button doesn't have a pointer cursor but we need to add one for the input anyway.nJoy!I use http://gregpike.net/demos/bootstrap-file-input/demo.html:or/*\n * Bootstrap 3 filestyle\n * http://dev.tudosobreweb.com.br/bootstrap-filestyle/\n *\n * Copyright (c) 2013 Markus Vinicius da Silva Lima\n * Update bootstrap 3 by Paulo Henrique Foxer\n * Version 2.0.0\n * Licensed under the MIT license.\n *\n */I modified @claviska answer and works as i like (Bootstrap 3, 4 not tested):The following code makes as above the pictureHtmlJavascriptI have the same problem, and i try it like this.The CSSThe JSHope you found the best solution...Try following in the Bootstrap v.3.3.4Here is alternate trick, it's not the best solution but it just give you a choiceHTML code:Javascript:In respect of claviska answer - if you want to show uploaded file name in a basic file upload you can do it in inputs' onchange event.

Using the starter page and the grid system, I was hoping the following:...would produce centered text.However, it still appears on the far left. What am I doing wrong?For other types of content, see Flavien's answer.Update: Bootstrap 2.3.0+ AnswerThe original answer was for an early version of bootstrap. As of bootstrap 2.3.0, you can simply give the div the class .text-center.Original Answer (pre 2.3.0)You need to define one of the two classes, row or span12 with a text-align: center. See http://jsfiddle.net/xKSUH/ or http://jsfiddle.net/xKSUH/1/NOTE: this was removed in Bootstrap 3.Pre-Bootstrap 3, you could use the CSS class pagination-centered like this:Class pagination-centered is already in bootstrap.css (or bootstrap.min.css) and has the only one rule:With Bootstrap 2.3.0. just use class text-centerI guess most of the people here are actually searching for the way to center the whole div and not only the text content (which is trivial…).The second way (instead of using text-align:center) to center things in HTML is to have an element with a fixed width and auto margin (left and right). With Bootstrap, the style defining auto margins is the \"container\" class.Take a look here for a fiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/D2RLR/7788/\"Centered content\" can mean many different things, and Bootstrap centering has changed a lot since the original post.Bootstrap 3Demo Bootstrap 3 Horizontal CenteringBootstrap 4mx-auto (auto x-axis margins) will center display:block or display:flex elements that have a defined width, (%, vw, px, etc..). Flexbox is used by default on grid columns, so there are also various flexbox centering methods.Demo Bootstrap 4 Horizontal CenteringNow that Bootstrap 4 is flexbox by default there are many different approaches to vertical alignment using: auto-margins, flexbox utils, or the display utils along with vertical align utils. At first \"vertical align utils\" seems obvious but these only work with inline and table display elements. Here are some Bootstrap 4 vertical centering options..1 - Vertical Center Using Auto Margins:Another way to vertically center is to use my-auto. This will center the element within it's container. For example, h-100 makes the row full height, and my-auto will vertically center the col-sm-12 column.Vertical Center Using Auto Margins Demomy-auto represents margins on the vertical y-axis and is equivalent to:2 - Vertical Center with Flexbox:Since Bootstrap 4 .row is now display:flex you can simply use align-self-center on any column to vertically center it...or, use align-items-center on the entire .row to vertically center align all col-* in the row...Vertical Center Different Height Columns Demo3 - Vertical Center Using Display Utils:Bootstrap 4 has display utils that can be used for display:table, display:table-cell, display:inline, etc.. These can be used with the vertical alignment utils to align inline, inline-block or table cell elements.Vertical Center Using Display Utils DemoBootstrap 3.1.1 has a .center-block class for centering divs. See: http://getbootstrap.com/css/#helper-classes-center.Or, as others have already said, use the .text-center class to centre text.The best way to do this is define a css style:Then where ever you need centered text you add it like so:or if you just want the p tag centered:The less inline css you use the better.The class .show-grid is applying center aligned text in the example in the link.You can always add style=\"text-align:center\" to your row div or some other class I would think.As of February 2013, in some cases, I add a \"centred\" class to the \"span\" div:and to CSS:The reason for this is because the span* div's get floated to the left, and the \"auto margin\" centering technique works only if the div is not floated.Demo (on JSFiddle): http://jsfiddle.net/5RpSh/8/embedded/result/JSFiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/5RpSh/8/If you use Bootstrap 3, it also has built-in CSS class named .text-center. That's what you want.Please see the example in jsfiddle. http://jsfiddle.net/ucheng/Q4Fue/Bootstrap 2.3 has a text-center class. On my side I define new CSS styles ready to use and easy to remember:Is it a good idea? \nIs there any good practice for this?If you are using Bootstrap 2.0+This can make the div centered to the page.Any text-align utility class would do the trick. Bootstrap has been using .text-center class for centering text for a long time now.Or you can create your own utilities. Some variations I've seen over the years:You need to adjust with the .span.Example:My preferred method for centering blocks of information while maintaining responsiveness (mobile compatibility) is to place two empty span1 divs before and after the content you wish to center.For Bootstrap version 3.1.1 and above, the best class for centering the content is the .center-block helper class.Do not use container-fluid in the main.Center-block is also an option not referred in above answersAll the class center-block does is to tell the element to have a margin of 0 auto, the auto being the left/right margins. However, unless the class text-center or css text-align:center; is set on the parent, the element does not know the point to work out this auto calculation from, so it will not center itself as anticipated.So text-center is a better option.You can use any one of the below typesI created this class to keep the  centered regardless of screen size while maintaining responsive features:Simply use a class, text-center, for the div or tag which you want. I think it may work fine. It is a Bootstrap class for text align center.Here are some text alignment Bootstrap classes:I tried two ways, and it worked fine to center the div. Both the ways will align the divs on all screens.Way 1: Using Push:Way 2: Using Offset:Result:ExplanationBootstrap will designate to the left, the first column of the specified screen-occupancy. If we use offset or push it will shift the 'this' column by 'those' many columns. Though I faced some issues in responsiveness of offset, push was awesome.Update 2018:In Bootstrap 4.1.3, content can be centered using class mx-auto.Reference: https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.1/utilities/spacing/#horizontal-centering"},

Another guide I found which explains arbitrary rotation matrices is Egon Rath's notes on matricesMatrix multiplication works between these 4x4 matrices of course, so to perform a rotation followed by a translation, you make the appropriate rotation matrix and multiply it by the translation matrix.This can give you a bit more freedom to get it just right, and will also make it pretty much completely impossible for anyone to understand what it's doing, including you in five minutes.But, you know, it works.Edit: I just realized that I missed mentioning probably the most important and practical use of this, which is to incrementally create complex 3D transformations via JavaScript, where things will make a bit more sense.You can also apply multiple transforms using an extra layer of markup e.g.:This can be really useful when animating elements with transforms using Javascript.You can apply more than one transform like this:Some time in the future, we can write it like this:This will become especially useful when applying individual classes on an element:This syntax is defined in the in-progress CSS Transforms Level 2 specification, but can't find anything about current browser support other then chrome canary.

Notice how you can tell where the focus is even without clicking the input? Now, let's try outline:none on our trusty <input>So, once again, use the TAB key to navigate after clicking the text and see what happens.See how it's more difficult to figure out where the focus is? The only telling sign is the cursor blinking. My example above is overly simplistic. In real-world situations, you wouldn't have only one element on the page. Something more along the lines of this. Now compare that to the same template if we keep the outline:So we have established the following Remove the ugly outline and add your own visual cues to indicate focus. Here's a very simple example of what I mean. I remove the outline and add a bottom border on :focus and :active. I also remove the default borders on the top, left and right sides by setting them to transparent on :focus and :active (personal preference)So, we try the approach above with our \"real-world\" example from earlier:This can be extended further by using external libraries that build on the idea of modifying the \"outline\" as opposed to removing it entirely like MaterializeYou can end up with something that is not ugly and works with very little effortThis was confusing me for some time until I discovered the line was neither a border or an outline, it was a shadow. So to remove it I had to use this:You could use CSS to disable that!\nThis is the code I use for disabling the blue border:This will remove the blue border!This is a working example: JSfiddle.netHope it helps!Removing all focus styles is bad for accessibility and keyboard users in general. But outlines are ugly and providing a custom focussed style for every single interactive element can be a real pain.So the best compromise I've found is to show the outline styles only when we detect that the user is using the keyboard to navigate. Basically, if the user presses TAB, we show the outlines and if he uses the mouse, we hide them.It does not stop you from writing custom focus styles for some elements but at least it provides a good default.This is how I do it:Use this code:I tried all the answers and I still couldn't get mine to work on Mobile, until I found -webkit-tap-highlight-color.So, what worked for me is...None of the solutions worked for me in Firefox. The following solution changes the border style on focus for Firefox and sets the outline to none for other browsers. I've effectively made the focus border go from a 3px blue glow to a border style that matches the text area border. Here's some border styles:   Dashed border (border 2px dashed red): \nNo border! (border 0px):\nTextarea border (border 1px solid gray): \nHere is the code:\nYou can try this alsoorYou can remove the orange or blue border (outline) around text/input boxes by using: outline:noneRemove the outline when focus is on element, using below CSS property:This CSS property removes the outline for all input fields on focus or use pseudo class to remove outline of element using below CSS property.This property removes the outline for selected element.Try thisThis would effect throughout your pagesThe only solutiion that worked with me"},

You have to trigger something called a \"block formatting context\" (BFC), which interacts with floats in a specific way.Just take that second div, remove the float, and give it overflow:hidden instead.  Any overflow value other than visible makes the block it's set on become a BFC.  BFCs don't allow descendant floats to escape them, nor do they allow sibling/ancestor floats to intrude into them.  The net effect here is that the floated div will do its thing, then the second div will be an ordinary block, taking up all available width except that occupied by the float.This should work across all current browsers, though you may have to trigger hasLayout in IE6 and 7.  I can't recall.Demos:I just discovered the magic of flex boxes (display: flex). Try this:Flex boxes give me the control I've wished css had for 15 years. Its finally here! More info: https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/This would be a good example of something that's trivial to do with tables and hard (if not impossible, at least in a cross-browser sense) to do with CSS.If both the columns were fixed width, this would be easy.If one of the columns was fixed width, this would be slightly harder but entirely doable.With both columns variable width, IMHO you need to just use a two-column table.Check this solution outThis is what the flex-grow property is for.\nNote: Add flex vendor prefixes if required by your supported browsers.Use calc:The problem with this is that all widths must be explicitly defined, either as a value(px and em work fine), or as a percent of something explicitly defined itself.Here, this might help...I don't understand why people are willing to work so hard to find a pure-CSS solution for simple columnar layouts that are SO EASY using the old TABLE tag.All Browsers still have the table layout logic... Call me a dinosaur perhaps, but I say let it help you.Much less risky in terms of cross-browser compatibility too.If the width of the other column is fixed, how about using the calc CSS function working for all common browsers:This way the width of the second row will be calculated (i.e. remaining width) and applied responsively. You can try CSS Grid Layout.flex-grow - This defines the ability for a flex item to grow if necessary. It accepts a unitless value that serves as a proportion. It dictates what amount of the available space inside the flex container the item should take up.If all items have flex-grow set to 1, the remaining space in the container will be distributed equally to all children. If one of the children has a value of 2, the remaining space would take up twice as much space as the others (or it will try to, at least).

I would recommend Simpl or, the slightly more complex, Blueprint framework.If you are using Simpl (which involves importing just one simpl.css file), you can do this:, for a 50-50 layout, or :, for a 25-75 one.It's that simple.I wrote a javascript function that I call from jQuery $(document).ready().

I added CSS rule for images:But for big_image.jpg, I receive width=500 and height=600. How I can set images to be re-sized, while keeping their aspect ratios.This will make image shrink if it's too big for specified area (as downside, it will not enlarge image).I've struggled with this problem quite hard, and eventually arrived at this simple solution:You can adjust the width and height to fit your needs, and the object-fit property will do the cropping for you.Cheers.The solutions below will allow scaling up and scaling down of the image, depending on the parent box width.All images have a parent container with a fixed width for demonstration purposes only. In production, this will be the width of the parent box.This solution tells the browser to render the image with max available width and adjust the height as a percentage of that width.With the fancier solution, you'll be able to crop the image regardless of its size and add a background color to compensate for the cropping.For the line specifying padding, you need to calculate the aspect ratio of the image, for example:So, top padding = 34.37%.The background-size property is ie>=9 only, but if that is fine with you, you can use a div with background-image and set background-size: contain:Now you can just set your div size to whatever you want and not only will the image keep its aspect ratio it will also be centralized both vertically and horizontally within the div. Just don't forget to set the sizes on the css since divs don't have the width/height attribute on the tag itself.This approach is different than setecs answer, using this the image area will be constant and defined by you (leaving empty spaces either horizontally or vertically depending on the div size and image aspect ratio), while setecs answer will get you a box that exactly the size of the scaled image (without empty spaces).Edit:\nAccording to the MDN background-size documentation you can simulate the background-size property in IE8 using a proprietary filter declaration:Very similar to some answers here, but in my case I had images that  sometimes were taller, sometimes larger. This style worked like a charm to make sure that all images use all available space, keep the ratio and not cuts:Remove the \"height\" property.By specifying both you are changing the aspect ratio of the image. Just setting one will resize but preserve the aspect ratio.Optionally, to restrict oversizings:Just add this to your css, It will automaticly shrink and expand with keeping the original ratio.There is no standard way to preserve aspect ratio for images with width, height and max-width specified together.So we are forced either to specify width and height to prevent page “jumps” during loading images, or to use max-width and not specify dimensions for images.Specifying just width (without height) typically makes not much sense, but you can try to override the height HTML-attribute by adding a rule like IMG {height: auto; } into your stylesheet.See also the related Firefox bug 392261.Set the CSS class of your image container tag to image-class:and add this you your CSS stylesheet.To maintain a responsive image while still enforcing the image to have a certain aspect ratio you can do the following:HTML:And SCSS:This can be used to enforce a certain aspect ratio, regardless of the size of the image that authors upload.Thanks to @Kseso at  http://codepen.io/Kseso/pen/bfdhg.

{"title": "Should I use 'border: none' or 'border: 0'?", "author": "John Himmelman", "date": "2010-05-27 16:25:24Z", "question": "Which of the two methods conforms to W3C standards?

Do they both behave as expected across browsers?Both are valid. It's your choice.I prefer border:0 because it's shorter; I find that easier to read. You may find none more legible. We live in a world of very capable CSS post-processors so I'd recommend you use whatever you prefer and then run it through a \"compressor\". There's no holy war worth fighting here.That all said, if you're hand-writing all your production CSS, I maintain —despite the grumbling in the comments— it doesn't hurt to be bandwidth conscious. Using border:0 will save an infinitesimal amount of bandwidth. On its own that counts for very little but if you make every byte count, you will make your website faster.The CSS2 specs are here. These are extended in CSS3 but not in any way relevant to this.You can use any combination of width, style and colour.\nHere,  0 sets the width, none the style. They have the same rendering result: nothing is shown.They are equivalent in effect, pointing to different shortcuts:And the other..Both work, just pick one and go with it :)As others have said both are valid and will do the trick. I'm not 100% convinced that they are identical though. If you have some style cascading going on then they could in theory produce different results since they are effectively overriding different values.For example. If you set \"border: none;\" and then later on have two different styles that override the border width and style then one will do something and the other will not.In the following example on both IE and firefox the first two test divs come out with no border. The second two however are different with the first div in the second block being plain and the second div in the second block having a medium width dashed border.So though they are both valid you may need to keep an eye on your styles if they do much cascading and such like I think.(note: this answer has been updated on 2014-08-01 to make it more detailed, more accurate, and to add a live demo)According to W3C CSS2.1 specification (“Omitted values are set to their initial values”), the following properties are equivalent:If these rules are the most specific ones applied to the borders of an element, then the borders won't be shown, either because of zero-width, or because of hidden/none style. So, at the first look, these three rules look equivalent. However, they behave in different ways when combined with other rules.When a table is rendered using border-collapse: collapse, then each rendered border is shared between multiple elements (inner borders are shared among as neighbor cells; outer borders are shared between cells and the table itself; but also rows, row groups, columns and column groups share borders). The specification defines some rules for border conflict resolution:So, in a table context, border: hidden (or border-style: hidden) will have the highest priority and will make the shared border hidden, no matter what.On the other end of the priorities, border: none (or border-style: none) have the lowest priority, followed by the zero-width border (because it is the narrowest border). This means that a computed value of border-style: none and a computed value of border-width: 0 are essentially the same.Since none and 0 affect different properties (border-style and border-width), they will behave differently when a more specific rule defines just the style or just the width. See Chris answer for an example.Want to see all these cases in one single page? Open the live demo!Using doesn't work in some versions of IE.\nIE9 is fine but in previous versions it displays the border even when the style is \"none\".\nI experienced this when using a print stylesheet where I didn't want borders on the input boxes.seems to work fine in all browsers.You may simply use both as per the specification kindly provided by Oli.I always use border:0 none;.Though there is no harm in specifying them seperately and some browsers will parse the CSS faster if you do use the legacy CSS1 property calls.Though border:0; will normally default the border style to none, I have however noticed some browsers enforcing their default border style which can strangely overwrite border:0;.I use:From 8.5.4 in CSS 2.1:So either of your methods look fine.Well, to precisely see the difference between border: 0 and border: none we can make some experiments.Lets create three divs, first one whose border can only be disabled by setting its width to zero, second one that can only be disabled by setting its style to none, and a third with a border that can only be \"disabled\" by setting its color to transparent. Then lets try the effect of:My results were the same in both firefox and chrome:border: 0; Seems to set border-width to 0 and border-style to none, but not change border-color;border: none; Seems to only change border-style (to none);border: transparent; Seems to change border-color to transparent and border-style to none;While results will most likely be the same (no border), the 0 and none are technically addressing different things.0 addresses border width and none addresses border style. Obviously a border of 0 width is nonexistent so will therefore have no style.However, if later on in your stylesheet you intend to override this, you would naturally specifically address one or the other. If I now wanted a 3px border, that would be directly overriding border: 0 in regards to width. If I now wanted a dotted border, that would be directly overriding border: none in regards to styling.Easiest Way to remove border with cssWE SHOULD USE BORDER 0According to my opinion and experience, I would suggest please use Border: 0;\nThere is a valid and very good reason because whenever we use border: none, I understand it works but think about we are using a border, 1px, 2px, 3px etc. I mean we are giving the value our border is ...px/em/rem right so we need to use border: 0; for removing the border value because as we know when we use background: none; it means we are removing the background some background that is not a value that is something else.ThanksIn my point,border:none is working but not valid w3c standard so better we can use border:0;"},

I think some of you have misunderstood the question. The OP wants to make a div full of content behave like a link. One example of this would be facebook ads - if you look, they're actually proper markup.For me the no-nos are: javascript (shouldn't be needed just for a link, and very bad SEO/accessibility); invalid HTML.In essence it's this:You can't make the div a link itself, but you can make an <a> tag act as a block, the same behaviour a <div> has.You can then set the width and height on it.This is an ancient question, but I thought I'd answer it since everyone here has some crazy solutions. It's actually very very simple...An anchor tag works like this - Sooo...Although I'm not sure if this is valid. If that's the reasoning behind spoken solutions, then I apologise...Requires a little javascript.\nBut, your div would be clickable.This option doesn’t require an empty.gif as in the most upvoted answer:HTML:CSS:As proposed at http://www.digitalskydesign.com/how-to-make-an-entire-div-a-link-using-css/This is a \"valid\" solution to achieving what you want.But most-likely what you really want is to have an <a> tag displayed as a block level element.I would not advise using JavaScript to simulate a hyperlink as that defeats the purpose of markup validation, which is ultimately to promote accessibility (publishing well-formed documents following proper semantic rules minimizes the possibility the same document will be interpreted differently by different browsers).It would be preferable to publish a web page that does not validate, but renders and functions properly on all browsers, including ones with JavaScript disabled. Furthermore, using onclick does not provide the semantic information for a screen reader to determine that the div is functioning as a link.Not sure if this is valid but it worked for me.The code :The cleanest way would be to use jQuery with the data-tags introduced in HTML. With this solution you can create a link on every tag you want. First define the tag (e.g. div) with a data-link tag:Now you can style the div however you want. And you have to create also the style for the \"link\"-alike behavior:And at last put this jQuery call to the page:With this code jQuery applys a click listener to every tag on the page which has a \"data-link\" attribute and redirects to the URL which is in the data-link attribute.To make thepeer's answer work in IE 7 and forward, it needs a few tweaks.you could also try by wrapping an anchor, then turning its height and width to be the same with its parent. This works for me perfectly.why not? use <a href=\"bla\"> <div></div> </a> works fine in HTML5This post is Old I know but I just had to fix the same issue because simply writing  a normal link tag with the display set to block does not make the whole div clickable in IE. so to fix this issue far simpler than having to use JQuery. Firstly let us understand why this happens: IE wont make an empty div clickable it only make the text/image within that div/a tag clickable.Solution: Fill the div with a bakground image and hide it from the viewer.How?\nYou ask good questions, now listen up.\nadd this backround style to the a tag And there you have it the whole div is now clickable. This was the best way for me cause Im using it for my Photo Gallery to let the user clik on one half of the image to move left/right and then place a small image as well just for visual effects. so for me I used the left and right images as background images anyway!Just have the link in the block and enhance it with jquery. It degrades 100% gracefully for anyone without javascript. Doing this with html isn't really the best solution imho.\nFor example:Then use jquery to make the block clickable (via web designer wall):Then all you have to do is add cursor styles to the divFor bonus points only apply these styles if javascript is enabled by adding a 'js_enabled' class to the div, or the body, or whatever.This example worked for me:This worked for me:HTML:CSS:This adds an invisible element (the span), which covers your entire div, and is above your whole div on the z-index, so when someone clicks on that div, the click is essentially intercepted by your invisible \"span\" layer, which is linked.Note: If you're already using z-indexes for other elements, just make sure the value of this z-index is higher than anything you want it to rest \"on top\" of.Actually you need to include the JavaScript code at the moment,\ncheck this tutorial to do so.but there is a tricky way to achieve this using a CSS code\nyou must nest an anchor tag inside your div tag and you must apply this property to it,when you've done that,it will make the whole width area clickable (but within the height of the anchor tag),if you want to cover the whole div area you must set the height of the anchor tag exactly to the height of the div tag,for example:this is gonna make the whole area clickable,then you can apply text-indent:-9999px to anchor tag to achieve the goal.this is really tricky and simple and it's just created using CSS code.here is an example: http://jsfiddle.net/hbirjand/RG8wW/This is the best way to do it as used on the BBC website and the Guardian:I found the technique here:\nhttp://codepen.io/IschaGast/pen/Qjxpxoheres the htmlheres the CSSThis work for me:You can give a link to your div by following method:You can make surround the element with a href tags or you can use jquery and useThis is the simplest way.Say, this is the div block I want to make clickable:So put a href as follows:Just consider the div block as a normal html element and enable the usual a href tag. \nIt works on FF at least.While I don't recommend doing this under any circumstance, here is some code that makes a DIV into a link (note: this example uses jQuery and certain markup is removed for simplicity):I pulled in  a variable because some values in my link will change depending on what record the user is coming from. \nThis worked for testing :and this works too :My smarty pants answer:\"Evasive answer to: \"How to make block level element a hyperlink and validate in XHTML 1.1\"Just use HTML5 DOCTYPE DTD.\"Didn't actually hold true for ie7onclick=\"location.href='page.html';\"Works IE7-9, Chrome, Safari, Firefox, if just everything could be this simple...just think a little outside the box ;-)"},

You would want to put a span tag around the image and set its style to text-align: center, as so:  The image will be centered.  In response to your question, it is the easiest and most foolproof way to center images, as long as you remember to apply the rule to the image's containing span (or div).  There are three methods for centering an element that I can suggest:The first and second methods only work if the parent is at least as wide as the image. When the image is wider than its parent, the image will not stay centered!!!But:\nThe third method is a good way for that!Here's an example:Only if you need to support ancient versions of Internet Explorer.The modern approach is to do margin: 0 auto in your CSS.Example here: http://jsfiddle.net/bKRMY/HTML:CSS:The only issue here is that the width of the paragraph must be the same as the width of the image. If you don't put a width on the paragraph, it will not work, because it will assume 100% and your image will be aligned left, unless of course you use text-align:center.Try out the fiddle and experiment with it if you like.If you are using a class with an image then the following will doIf it is only an image in a specific class that you want to center align then following will do:On the container holding image you can use a CSS 3 Flexbox to perfectly center the image inside, both vertically and horizontally.Let's assume you have <div class=\"container\"> as the image holder:Then as CSS you have to use:And this will make all your content inside this div perfectly centered.Simply change parent align :)Try this one on parent properties:You can use text-align: center on the parent and change the img to display: inline-block → it therefore behaves like a text-element and is will be centered if the parent has a width!The simplest solution I found was to add this to my img-element:It seems I don't need to add \"0\" before the \"auto\" as suggested by others. Maybe that is the proper way, but it works well enough for my purposes without the \"0\" as well. At least on latest Firefox, Chrome, and Edge.I would use a div to center align an image. As in:If you want to set the image as the background, I've got a solution:To center a non background image depends on whether you want to display the image as an inline (default behavior) or a block element.Case of inlineIf you want to keep the default behavior of the image's display CSS property, you will need to wrap your image inside another block element to which you must set text-align: center;Case of blockIf you want to consider the image as a block element of its own, then text-align property does not make a sens, and you should do this instead:The answer to your question:Yes and no.ReferencesOne more way to scale - display it:Use this to your img CSS:display: block with margin: 0 didn't work for me, neither wrapping with a text-align: center element.This is my solution:translateX is supported by most browsersI discovered that if I have an image and some text inside a div, then I can use text-align:center to align the text and the image in one swoop.HTML:CSS:CodePen:\nhttps://codepen.io/artforlife/pen/MoBzrL?editors=1100Sometimes we directly add the content and images on the WordPress administrator inside the pages.

But I can't find the right way to add that font on the server. And how do I include that font with CSS into the HTML? Is this possible to do without graphics?This could be done via CSS:It is supported for all of the regular browsers if you use TrueType-Fonts (TTF) or the Web Open Font Format (WOFF).You can add some fonts via Google Web Fonts.Technically, the fonts are hosted at Google and you link them in the HTML header. Then, you can use them freely in CSS with @font-face (read about it).For example:In the <head> section:Then in CSS:The solution seems quite reliable (even Smashing Magazine uses it for an article title.). There are, however, not so many fonts available so far in Google Font Directory.The way to go is using the @font-face CSS declaration which allows authors to specify online fonts to display text on their web pages. By allowing authors to provide their own fonts, @font-face eliminates the need to depend on the limited number of fonts users have installed on their computers.Take a look at the following table: As you can see, there are several formats that you need to know about mainly due to cross-browser compatibility. The scenario in mobile devices isn't much different.1 - Full browser compatibilityThis is the method with the deepest support possible right now:2 - Most of the browserThings are shifting heavily toward WOFF though, so you can probably get away with:3 - Only the latest browsersOr even just WOFF.\nYou then use it like this:That's mainly what you need to know about implementing this feature. If you want to research more on the subject I'll encourage to take a look at the following resources. Most of what I put here is extracted from the followingIf by non standard font, you mean custom font of a standard format, here's how I do it, and it works for all browsers I've checked so far:so you'll just need both the ttf and eot fonts. Some tools available online can make the conversion.But if you want to attach font in a non standard format (bitmaps etc), I can't help you.I've found that the easiest way to have non-standard fonts on a website is to use sIFRIt does involve the use of a Flash object that contains the font, but it degrades nicely to standard text / font if Flash is not installed.The style is set in your CSS, and JavaScript sets up the Flash replacement for your text.Edit: (I still recommend using images for non-standard fonts as sIFR adds time to a project and can require maintenance).The article Font-face in IE: Making Web Fonts Work says it works with all three major browsers.Here is a sample I got working: http://brendanjerwin.com/test_font.htmlMore discussion is in Embedding Fonts.Typeface.js and Cufon are two other interesting options. They are JavaScript components that render special font data in JSON format (which you can convert from TrueType or OpenType formats on their web sites) via the new <canvas> element in all newer browsers except Internet Explorer and via VML in Internet Explorer.The main problem with both (as of now) is that selecting text does not work or at least works only quite awkwardly.Still, it is very nice for headlines. Body text... I don't know.And it's surprisingly fast.Or you could try sIFR. I know it uses Flash, but only if available. If Flash isn't available, it displays the original text in its original (CSS) font.The technique that the W3C has recommended for do this is called \"embedding\" and is well described by the three articles here: Embedding Fonts.  In my limited experiments, I have found this process error-prone and have had limited success in making it function in a multi-browser environment.Safari and Internet Explorer both support the CSS @font-face rule, however they support two different embedded font types. Firefox is planning to support the same type as Apple some time soon. SVG can embed fonts but isn't that widely supported yet (without a plugin).I think the most portable solution I've seen is to use a JavaScript function to replace headings etc. with an image generated and cached on the server with your font of choice -- that way you simply update the text and don't have to stuff around in Photoshop.If you use ASP.NET, it's really easy to generate image based fonts without actually having to install (as in adding to the installed font base) fonts on the server by using:and then drawing with that font onto a Graphics.It looks like it only works in Internet Explorer, but a quick Google search for \"html embed fonts\" yields http://www.spoono.com/html/tutorials/tutorial.php?id=19If you want to stay platform-agnostic (and you should!) you'll have to use images, or else just use a standard font.I did a bit of research and dug up Dynamic Text Replacement (published 2004-06-15).This technique uses images, but it appears to be \"hands free\". You write your text, and you let a few automated scripts do automated find-and-replace on the page for you on the fly. It has some limitations, but it is probably one of the easier choices (and more browser compatible) than all the rest I've seen.It is also possible to use WOFF fonts - example hereJust simply provide the link to actual font like this and you will be good to goTypeface.js JavaScript Way:http://typeface.neocracy.org/See the article 50 Useful Design Tools For Beautiful Web Typography for alternative methods.I have only used Cufon. I have found it reliable and very easy to use, so I've stuck with it.If you have a file of your font, then you will need to add more formats of that font for other browsers. For this purpose I use font generator like Fontsquirrel it provides all the font formats & its @font-face CSS, you will only need to just drag & drop it into your CSS file."},

The same would work for a header element, just set top:0 instead.For example:CSS:I believe the correct answer is that HTML 5 and CSS3 have no support for printing page header and footers in print media.And while you might be able to simulate it with: they each have bugs that prevent them from being the ideal general solution.I just spent the better half of my day coming up with a solution that actually worked for me and thought I would share what I did. The problem with the solutions above that I was having was that all of my paragraph elements would overlap with the footer I wanted at the bottom of the page. In order to get around this, I used the following CSS:The page-break-inside for p and content-block was crucial for me. Any time I have a p following an h*, I wrap them both in a div class = \"content-block\"> to ensure they stay together and don't break. I'm hoping that someone finds this useful because it took me about 3 hours to figure out (I'm also new to CSS/HTML, so there's that...)Per a request in the comments, I am adding an example HTML document. You'll want to copy this into an HTML file, open it, and then choose to print the page. The print preview should show this working. It worked in Firefox and IE on my end, but Chrome made the font small enough to fit on one page, so it didn't work there. I have been searching for years for a solution and found this post on how to print a footer that works on multiple pages without overlapping page content.My requirement was IE8, so far I have found that this does not work in Chrome. [update]As of 1 March 2018, it works in Chrome as wellThis example uses tables and the tfoot element by setting the css style: From this question -- add the following styles to a print-only stylesheet. This solution will work in IE and Firefox, but not in Chrome (as of version 21):Use page breaks to define the styles in CSS:Then add the markup in the document at the appropriate places:Referencesthe magic solution is really putting every thing in single table.and make a single tr, td and put every thing in a divCODE::which results in overflow that will make things overlap with the header within the page breaks..so >> use: page-break-inside: avoid !important; with this class article.pretty simple, hope this will give you the best result you wishing for.best regards. ;)I tried to fight this futile battle combining tfoot & css rules but it only worked on Firefox :(. When using plain css, the content flows over the footer. When using tfoot, the footer on the last page does not stay nicely on the bottom. This is because table footers are meant for tables, not physical pages. Tested on Chrome 16, Opera 11, Firefox 3 & 6 and IE6.One approach that only works for adding headers to every page is to wrap your content in a <table> and then put your header content in a <thead> tag and your content in a <tbody> tag, like so:This works in Chrome, not 100% sure about other browsers.If you can use javascipt, have the client handle laying out the content using javascript to place elements based on available space.You could use the jquery columnizer plugin to dynamically lay out your content in fixed size blocks and position your headers and footers as part of the rendering routine.\nhttp://welcome.totheinter.net/columnizer-jquery-plugin/See example 10\nhttp://welcome.totheinter.net/autocolumn/sample10.htmlThe browser will still add its own headers or footers if enabled in the os. Consistent layout across platforms and browsers will likely require conditional css.Is this something you want to print-only? You could add it to every page on your site and use CSS to define the tag as a print-only media.As an example, this could be an example header:And in your CSS, do something like this:Finally, to include the header/footer on every page you might use server-side includes or if you have any pages being generated with PHP or ASP you could simply code it in to a common file.Edit:This answer is intended to provide a way to show something on the physical printed version of a document while not showing it otherwise. However just as comments suggest, it doesn't solve the issue of having a footer on multiple printed pages when content overflows.I'm leaving it here in case it's helpful nevertheless.I'm surprised and unimpressed that Chrome has such terrible CSS print support.My task required showing a slightly different footer on each page. In the simplest case, just an incrementing chapter and page number. In more complex cases, more text in the footer - for example, several footnotes - which could expand it in size, causing what is on that page's content area to be shrunk and part of it to reflow to the next page.CSS print cannot solve this, at least not with shoddy browser support today. But stepping outside of print, CSS3 can do a lot of the heavy lifting:https://jsfiddle.net/b9chris/moctxd2a/29/SCSS:There's a little more code in the example, including some Cat Ipsum; but the js in use is just there to demonstrate how much the header/footer can vary without breaking pagination. The key really is to take a column-bottom-sticking trick from CSS Flexbox and then apply it to a page of a known, fixed height - in this case, an 8.5\"x11\" piece of US letter-sized paper, with .5\" margins leaving width: 7.5in and height: 10in exactly. Once the CSS flex container is told its exact dimensions (div.page), it's easy to get the header and footer to expand and contract the way they do in conventional typography.What's left is flowing the content of the page when the footer, for example, grows to 8 footnotes not 3. In my case the content is fixed enough that I don't need to worry about it, but I'm sure there's a way to do it. One approach that leaps to mind, is to turn the header and footer into 100% width floats, then position them with Javascript. The browser will handle the interruptions to regular content flow for you automatically.If you are using a template engine like Asp.net Razor Engine or Angular, \nI think you must re-generate your page and split the page in several pages and then you can freely markup each page and put header and footer on theme.\n one example could be as bellow:I found one solution. The basic idea is to make a table and in thead section place the data of header in tr and by css force to show that tr only in print not in screen then your normal header should be force to show only in screen not in print. 100% working on many pages print. sample code is hereTry this, for me it's working on Chrome, Firefox and Safari. You will get header and footer fixed to each page without overlapping the page contentCSSHTMLBased on some post, i think position: fixed works for me.Press Ctrl+P in chrome see the header & footer text on each page.\nHope it helps"},

This will work in all browsers, including IE 8 and up.Using the em unit allows responsiveness to font size changes.

The list-style-image attribute is flakey in cross-browser environments, and adding an extra element, such as a span, is unneccessary.  So your code would end up looking something like this:The easiest thing you can do is wrap the contents of the <li> in a <span> or equivalent then you can set the color independently.Alternatively, you could make an image with the bullet color you want and set it with the list-style-image property.A variation of Lea Verou solution with perfect indentation in multi-line entries could be something like this:I am adding my solution to this problem.I don't want to use image and validator will punish you for using negative values in CSS, so I go this way:I know it's a bit of a late answer for this post, but for reference...CSSThe bullet colour is defined on the ul tag and then we switch the li colour back.Taking Lea's demo, here's a different way of making unordered lists, with borders: http://jsfiddle.net/vX4K8/7/HTMLCSSLea Verous solution is good but i wanted more control over the position of the bullets so this is my approach:This will do it.."},

At least the browser doesn't crash.And the lesson to learn is that you should beware of entering too large values for the z-index property because they wrap around.The minimum value of Z-index is 0;  the maximum value depends on browser type. It depends on the browser (although the latest version of all browsers should max out at 2147483638), as does the browser's reaction when the maximum is exceeded.http://www.puidokas.com/max-z-index/It's the maximum value of a 32 bits integer: 2147483647Also see the docs: https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS22/visuren.html#z-index\n(Negative numbers are allowed)Out of experience, I think the correct maximum z-index is 2147483638. [Edited to correct the value which is slightly higher].Z-Index only works for elements that have position: relative; or position: absolute; applied to them. If that's not the problem we'll need to see an example page to be more helpful.EDIT: The good doctor has already put the fullest explanation but the quick version is that the minimum is 0 because it can't be a negative number and the maximum - well, you'll never really need to go above 10 for most designs.I have found that often if z-index isn't working its because its parent/siblings don't have a specified z-index.  So if you have:item #3, or even #4, may be contesting #2 for the click/hover space, though if you set #1 to z-index 0, the siblings who's z-index put them in independant stacks now are in the same stack and will z-index properly.This has a helpful and fairly humanized description: http://foohack.com/2007/10/top-5-css-mistakes/\n A user above says \"well, you'll never really need to go above 10 for most designs.\" Depending on your project, you may only need z-indexes 0-1, or z-indexes 0-10000. You'll often need to play in the higher digits...especially if you are working with lightbox viewers (9999 seems to be the standard and if you want to top their z-index, you'll need to exceed that!)While INT_MAX is probably the safest bet, WebKit apparently uses doubles internally and thus allows very large numbers (to a certain precision). LLONG_MAX e.g. works fine (at least in 64-Bit Chromium and WebkitGTK), but will be rounded to 9223372036854776000.(Although you should consider carefully whether you really, really need this many z indices…)."},

Is there any way to force my stylesheets and if possible, completely overwrite Chrome's default stylesheet?What are the target browsers? Different browsers set different default CSS rules. Try including a CSS reset, such as the meyerweb css reset or normalize.css, to remove those defaults. Google \"css reset vs normalize\" to see the differences.If <!DOCTYPE> is missing in your html you may experience that the browser gives preference to the \"user agent stylesheet\" over your custom stylesheet. Adding the doctype fixes this.Regarding the concept “user agent style sheet”, consult section Cascade in the CSS 2.1 spec.User agent style sheets are overridden by anything that you set in your own style sheet. They are just the rock bottom: in the absence of any style sheets provided by the page or by the user, the browser still has to render the content somehow, and the user agent style sheet just describes this.So if you think you have a problem with a user agent style sheet, then you really have a problem with your markup, or your style sheet, or both (about which you wrote nothing).Marking the document as HTML5 by the proper doctype on the first line, solved my issue.A user agent style sheet is a ”default style sheet” provided by the browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Edge, etc.) in order to present the page in a way that satisfies ”general presentation expectations.” For example, a default style sheet would provide base styles for things like font size, borders, and spacing between elements. It is common to employ a reset style sheet to deal with inconsistencies amongst browsers. From the spec...For more information about user agents in general...https://www.w3.org/TR/UAAG20/#def-user-agentDefine the values that you don't want to be used from Chrome's user agent style in your own CSS.Answering the question in title, what is the user agent stylesheet, the set of default styles in the browser, here are some of them (and most relevant ones also in today's web):Personal opinion, don't fight with them, they have good default values, for example in rtl/bidi cases, and are consistent nowadays, reset what you see irrelevant to you, not all of them at once.Some browsers use their own way to read .css files.\nSo the right way to beat this:\nIf you type the command line directly in the .html source code, this beats the .css file, in that way, you told the browser directly what to do and the browser is at position not to read the commands from the .css file.\nRemember that the commands writen in the .html file is stronger than the command in the .css.I had the same problem as one of my  was have margin set by the browser, it was quite annoying but then i figured out as most of the people said, its a mark up error.I went back and checked my  section and my css link was like below:<link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"ex.css\">i included type in it and made it like below:<link rel=\"stylesheet\" type=\"text/css\" href=\"ex.css\">my problem was solved.

The request path for the minified bundle can have a different path than the original css. This may happen automatically so it can cause confusion.The mapped request path for the minified bundle should be \"/originalcssfolder/minifiedbundlename\" not just \"minifiedbundlename\".In other words, name your bundles to have same path (with the /) as the original folder structure, this way any external resources like fonts, images will map to correct URIs by the browser.

Some examples I have found:Or:What do you think these 'breakpoints' should be for each device?IMO these are the best breakpoints:Edit: Refined to work better with 960 grids:In practice, many designers convert pixels to ems, largely b/c ems better afford zooming. At standard zoom 1em === 16px. Multiply pixels by 1em/16px to get ems. For example, 320px === 20em.In response to the comment, min-width is standard in \"mobile-first\" design, wherein you start by designing for your smallest screens, and then add ever-increasing media queries, working you way onto larger and larger screens. Regardless of whether you prefer min-, max-, or combinations thereof, be cognizant of the order of your rules, keeping in mind that if multiple rules match the same element, the later rules will override the earlier rules.If you want to target a device then just write min-device-width. For example:Here are some good articles:The general wisdom is not to target specific devices or sizes, but to reframe the term 'breakpoint':You can use responsivepx.com to find the 'natural' breakpoints, as in 'breakpoints are dead' by Marc Drummond.The 'breakpoints' then become the actual point at which your mobile design begins to 'break' i.e. cease to be usable or visually pleasing. Once you have a good working mobile site, without media queries, you can stop being concerned about specific sizes and simply add media queries that handle successively larger viewports.If you're not trying to pin a design to an exact screen size, this approach works by removing the need to target specific devices. The integrity of the design itself at each breakpoint ensures that it will hold up at any size. In other words, if a menu/content section/whatever stops being usable at a certain size, design a breakpoint for that size, not for a specific device size.See Lyza Gardner's post on behavioural breakpoints, and also Zeldman's post about Ethan Marcotte and how responsive web design evolved from the intitial idea.Further, the simpler and more semantic the DOM structure with nav, header, main, section, footer etc. (avoiding abominations like div class=\"header\" with nested inner div tags) the easier it will be to engineer responsiveness, especially avoiding floats by using CSS Grid Layout (Sarah Drasner's grid generator is a great tool for this) and flexbox for arranging and re-ordering according to your RWD design plan.The best breakpoints recommended by Twitter BootstrapIt's not a matter of pixels count, it's a matter of actual size (in mm or inches) of characters on the screen, which depends on pixels density.\nHence \"min-width:\" and \"max-width:\" are useless.\nA full explanation of this issue is here:\nwhat exactly is device pixel ratio?\"@media\" queries take into account the pixels count and the device pixel ratio, resulting in a \"virtual resolution\" which is what you have to actually take into account while designing your page: if your font is 10px fixed-width and the \"virtual horizontal resolution\" is 300 px, 30 characters will be needed to fill a line.Since there are many varying screen sizes that always change and most likely will always change the best way to go is to base your break points and media queries on your design.The easiest way to go about this is to grab your completed desktop design and open it in your web browser. Shrink the screen slowly to make it narrower. Observe to see when the design starts to, \"break\", or looks horrible and cramped. At this point a break point with a media query would be required.It's common to create three sets of media queries for desktop, tablet and phone. But if your design looks good on all three, why bother with the complexity of adding three different media queries that are not necessary. Do it on an as-needed basis!Nowadays the most common thing is to see retina-screen devices, in other words: devices with high resolutions and a very high pixel density (but usually smaller than 6 inches physical size). That's why you will need retina display specialized media-queries on your CSS. This is the most complete example I could find:Source: CSS-Tricks WebsiteThe behavior does not change on desktop. But on tablets and mobiles, I expand the navbar to cover the big logo image. Note: Use the margin (top and bottom) as much as you need for your logo height. For my case, 60px top and bottom worked perfectly! Check the navbar here.One extra feature is you can also use-media queries in the media attribute of the <link> tag.With this, the browser will download all CSS resources, regardless of the media attribute.\nThe difference is that if the media-query of the media attribute is evaluated to false then that .css file and his content will not be render-blocking.Therefore, it is recommended to use the media attribute in the <link> tag since it guarantees a better user experience.Here you can read a Google article about this issue https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/performance/critical-rendering-path/render-blocking-cssSome tools that will help you to automate the separation of your css code in different files according to your media-querysWebpack\nhttps://www.npmjs.com/package/media-query-plugin \nhttps://www.npmjs.com/package/media-query-splitting-pluginPostCSS\nhttps://www.npmjs.com/package/postcss-extract-media-query I am using following one to do my job."},

In pure CSS you can do the following:Note: No support in IE 8.Or, if you have jQuery:You have the :nth-child() pseudo-class:In the early days of :nth-child() its browser support was kind of poor.

The solution that works for IE+ other browsers is this. You can use nth-child(odd/even) selectors however not all browsers (ie 6-8, ff v3.0) support these rules hence why most solutions fall back to some form of javascript/jquery solution to add the classes to the rows for these non compliant browsers to get the tiger stripe effect.There is a fairly easy way to do this in PHP, if I understand your query, I assume that you code in PHP and you are using CSS and javascript to enhance the output.The dynamic output from the database will carry a for loop to iterate through results which are then loaded into the table. Just add a function call to the  like this: then add the function to the page or library file:}Now this will alternate dynamically between colors at each newly generated table row.It's a lot easier than messing about with CSS that doesn't work on all browsers.Hope this helps."},

For more complicated scenarios, you'd need to use different CSS, or use JavaScript.Using the sibling selector is the general solution for styling other elements when hovering over a given one, but it works only if the other elements follow the given one in the DOM. What can we do when the other elements should actually be before the hovered one? Say we want to implement a signal bar rating widget like the one below:This can actually be done easily using the CSS flexbox model, by setting flex-direction to reverse, so that the elements are displayed in the opposite order from the one they're in the DOM. The screenshot above is from such a widget, implemented with pure CSS.Flexbox is very well supported by 95% of modern browsers.Big thanks to Mike and Robertc for their helpful posts!If you have two elements in your HTML and you want to :hover over one and target a style change in the other the two elements must be directly related--parents, children or siblings. This means that the two elements either must be one inside the other or must both be contained within the same larger element. I wanted to display definitions in a box on the right side of the browser as my users read through my site and :hover over highlighted terms; therefore, I did not want the 'definition' element to be displayed inside the 'text' element.I almost gave up and just added javascript to my page, but this is the future dang it! We should not have to put up with back sass from CSS and HTML telling us where we have to place our elements to achieve the effects we want! In the end we compromised.While the actual HTML elements in the file must be either nested or contained in a single element to be valid :hover targets to each other, the css position attribute can be used to display any element where ever you want. I used position:fixed to place the target of my :hover action where I wanted it on the user's screen regardless to its location in the HTML document.The html:The css:In this example the target of a :hover command from an element within #explainBox must either be #explainBox or also within #explainBox. The position attributes assigned to #definitions force it to appear in the desired location (outside #explainBox) even though it is technically located in an unwanted position within the HTML document.I understand it is considered bad form to use the same #id for more than one HTML element; however, in this case the instances of #light can be described independently due to their respective positions in uniquely #id'd elements. Is there any reason not to repeat the id #light in this case?Only this worked for me:Where .cube is CssClass of the #cube.Tested in Firefox, Chrome and Edge.Here is another idea that allow you to affect other elements without considering any specific selector and by only using the :hover state of the main element. For this, I will rely on the use of custom properties (CSS variables). As we can read in the specification:The idea is to define custom properties within the main element and use them to style child elements and since these properties are inherited we simply need to change them within the main element on hover.  Here is an example:Why this can be better than using specific selector combined with hover?I can provide at least 2 reasons that make this method a good one to consider:Here is a more complex example:As we can see above, we only need one CSS declaration in order to change many properties of different elements."},

It is a combination of basically 3 aspects:These 3 together mean that by the time you have the text content you cannot ascend back to the containing element, and you cannot style the present text.  This is likely significant as descending only allows for a singular tracking of context and SAX style parsing. Ascending or other selectors involving other axes introduce the need for more complex traversal or similar solutions that would greatly complicate the application of CSS to the DOM.You could set content as data attribute and then use attribute selectors, as shown here:You can also use jQuery to easily set the data-content attributes:As CSS lacks this feature you will have to use JavaScript to style cells by content. For example with XPath's contains:Then use the result like so:https://jsfiddle.net/gaby_de_wilde/o7bka7Ls/9/I'm afraid this is not possible, because the content is no attribute nor is it accessible via a pseudo class. The full list of CSS3 selectors can be found in the CSS3 specification.For those who are looking to do Selenium CSS text selections, this script might be of some use.The trick is to select the parent of the element that you are looking for, and then search for the child that has the text: This will return the first element if there is more than one since it's always one element, in my case.I agree the data attribute (voyager's answer) is how it should be handled, BUT, CSS rules like: can often be much easier to set up, especially with client-side libs like angularjs which could be as simple as:Just make sure that the content is only one word! Or you could even map to different CSS class names with:For completeness, here's the data attribute approach:@voyager's answer about using data-* attribute (e.g. data-gender=\"female|male\" is the most effective and standards compliant approach as of 2017:Pretty much most goals can be attained as there are some albeit limited selectors oriented around text. The ::first-letter is a pseudo-element that can apply limited styling to the first letter of an element. There is also a ::first-line pseudo-element besides obviously selecting the first line of an element (such as a paragraph) also implies that it is obvious that CSS could be used to extend this existing capability to style specific aspects of a textNode.Until such advocacy succeeds and is implemented the next best thing I could suggest when applicable is to explode/split words using a space deliminator, output each individual word inside of a span element and then if the word/styling goal is predictable use in combination with :nth selectors:Else if not predictable to, again, use voyager's answer about using data-* attribute. An example using PHP:Most of the answers here try to offer alternative to how to write the HTML code to include more data because at least up to CSS3 you cannot select an element by partial inner text. But it can be done, you just need to add a bit of vanilla JavaScript, notice since female also contains male it will be selected:If you're using Chimp / Webdriver.io, they support a lot more CSS selectors than the CSS spec. This, for example, will click on the first anchor that contains the words \"Bad bear\":You could also use content with attr() and style table cells that are :not :empty:A ZeroWidthSpace is used to change the color and may be added using vanilla JavaScript:Although the <td>s end tag may be omitted doing so may cause it to be treated as non-empty.If you don't create the DOM yourself (e.g. in a userscript) you can do the following with pure JS:Console outputDoing small Filter Widgets like this: The syntax of this question looks like Robot Framework syntax.\nIn this case, although there is no css selector that you can use for contains, there is a SeleniumLibrary keyword that you can use instead.\nThe Wait Until Element Contains.Example:"},

NOTE: as per comment below, grid classes for a given screen size apply to that screen size and larger unless another declaration overrides it (i.e. col-xs-6 col-md-4 spans 6 columns on xs and sm, and 4 columns on md and lg, even though sm and lg were never explicitly declared)NOTE: if you don't define xs, it will default to col-xs-12 (i.e. col-sm-6 is half the width on sm, md and lg screens, but full-width on xs screens).NOTE: it's actually totally fine if your .row includes more than 12 cols, as long as you are aware of how they will react. --This is a contentious issue, and not everyone agrees.OK, the answer is easy, but read on:col-lg- stands for column large ≥ 1200px\ncol-md- stands for column medium ≥ 992px\ncol-xs- stands for column extra small ≥ 768pxThe pixel numbers are the breakpoints, so for example col-xs is targeting the element when the window is smaller than 768px(likely mobile devices)...I also created the image below to show how the grid system works, in this examples I use them with 3, like col-lg-6 to show you how the grid system work in the page, look at how lg, md and xs are responsive to the window size:The main point is this:col-lg-* col-md-* col-xs-* col-sm define how many columns will there be in these different screen sizes.Example: if you want there to be two columns in desktop screens and in phone screens you put two col-md-6 and two col-xs-6 classes in your columns.If you want there to be two columns in desktop screens and only one column in phone screens (ie two rows stacked on top of each other) you put two col-md-6 and two col-xs-12 in your columns and because sum will be 24 they will auto stack on top of each other, or just leave xs style out.From Twitter Bootstrap documentation:to Read More...Here you gocol-lg-2    :  if the screen is large (lg) then this component will take space of 2  elements considering entire row can fit 12 elements ( so you will see that on large screen this component takes 16% space of a row)col-lg-6    :  if the screen is large (lg) then this component will take space of 6  elements considering entire row can fit 12 elements -- when applied you will see that the component has taken half the available space in the row.Above rule is only applied when the screen is large. when the screen is small this rule is discarded and only one component per row is shown.Below image shows various screen size widths :"},

I have a div and need to add a link which will add the text to the clipboard. Is there a solution for this? After I click copy text, then I press Ctrl + V, it must be pasted.Edit as of 2016As of 2016, you can now copy text to the clipboard in most browsers because most browsers have the ability to programmatically copy a selection of text to the clipboard using document.execCommand(\"copy\") that works off a selection.As with some other actions in a browser (like opening a new window), the copy to clipboard can only be done via a specific user action (like a mouse click).  For example, it cannot be done via a timer.Here's a code example:Here's a little more advanced demo: https://jsfiddle.net/jfriend00/v9g1x0o6/And, you can also get a pre-built library that does this for you with clipboard.js.Old, historical part of answerDirectly copying to the clipboard via JavaScript is not permitted by any modern browser for security reasons. The most common workaround is to use a Flash capability for copying to the clipboard that can only be triggered by a direct user click.As mentioned already, ZeroClipboard is a popular set of code for managing the Flash object to do the copy. I've used it. If Flash is installed on the browsing device (which rules out mobile or tablet), it works.The next most common work-around is to just place the clipboard-bound text into an input field, move the focus to that field and advise the user to press Ctrl + C to copy the text.Other discussions of the issue and possible work-arounds can be found in these prior Stack Overflow posts:These questions asking for a modern alternative to using Flash have received lots of question upvotes and no answers with a solution (probably because none exist):Internet Explorer and Firefox used to have non-standard APIs for accessing the clipboard, but their more modern versions have deprecated those methods (probably for security reasons).There is a nascent standards effort to try to come up with a \"safe\" way to solve the most common clipboard problems (probably requiring a specific user action like the Flash solution requires), and it looks like it may be partially implemented in the latest versions of Firefox and Chrome, but I haven't confirmed that yet.There is another non-Flash way (apart from the Clipboard API mentioned in jfriend00's answer). You need to select the text and then execute the command copy to copy to the clipboard whatever text is currently selected on the page.For example, this function will copy the content of the passed element into the clipboard (updated with suggestion in the comments from PointZeroTwo):This is how it works:You can see a quick demo here:The main issue is that not all browsers support this feature at the moment, but you can use it on the main ones from:Update 1: This can be achieved also with a pure JavaScript solution (no jQuery):Notice that we pass the id without the # now.As madzohan reported in the comments below, there is some strange issue with the 64-bit version of Google Chrome in some cases (running the file locally). This issue seems to be fixed with the non-jQuery solution above.Madzohan tried in Safari and the solution worked but using document.execCommand('SelectAll') instead of using .select() (as specified in the chat and in the comments below).As PointZeroTwo points out in the comments, the code could be improved so it would return a success/failure result. You can see a demo on this jsFiddle.As a user pointed out in the Spanish version of StackOverflow, the solutions listed above work perfectly if you want to copy the content of an element literally, but they don't work that great if you want to paste the copied text with format (as it is copied into a input type=\"text\", the format is \"lost\").A solution for that would be to copy  into a content editable div and then copy it using the execCommand in a similar way. Here there is an example - click on the copy button and then paste into the content editable box below:And in jQuery, it would be like this:clipboard.js is a nice utility that allows copying of text or HTML data to the clipboard without use of Flash. It's very easy to use; just include the .js and use something like this:clipboard.js is also on GitHub.Edit on Jan 15, 2016:  The top answer was edited today to reference the same API in my answer posted in August 2015.  The previous text was instructing users to use ZeroClipboard.  Just want to be clear that I didn't yank this from jfriend00's answer, rather the other way around.  Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication. \nIf you don't want the text-to-be-coppied to be visible:\njQuery:HTML: With Line Breaks (Extention of the Answer from Alvaro Montoro) You can use this code for copy input value in page in Clipboard by click a buttonThis is HtmlThen for this html , we must use this JQuery CodeThis is the simplest solution for this questionEven better approach without flash or any other requirements is clipboard.js. All you need to do is add data-clipboard-target=\"#toCopyElement\" on any button, initialize it new Clipboard('.btn'); and it will copy the content of DOM with id toCopyElement to clipboard. This is a snippet that copy the text provided in your question via a link.One limitation though is that it does not work on safari, but it works on all other browser including mobile browsers as it does not use flashIt is a simplest method to copy the contentjQuery simple solution.Should be triggered by user's click.It's very important that the input field does not have display: none. The browser will not select the text and therefore will not be copied. Use opacity: 0 with a width of 0px to fix the problem.you can just using this lib for easy realize the copy goal!https://clipboardjs.com/orhttps://github.com/zeroclipboard/zeroclipboardhttp://zeroclipboard.org/The text to copy is in text input,like:    <input type=\"text\" id=\"copyText\" name=\"copyText\">  and, on button click above text should get copied to clipboard,so button is   like:<button type=\"submit\" id=\"copy_button\" data-clipboard-target='copyText'>Copy</button>  Your script should be like:For CDN filesnote: ZeroClipboard.swf and ZeroClipboard.js\" file should be in the same folder as your file using this functionality is, OR you have to include like we include <script src=\"\"></script> on our pages.Most of the proposed answers create an extra temporary hidden input element(s). Because most browsers nowadays support div content edit, I propose a solution that does not create hidden element(s), preserve text formatting and use pure JavaScript or jQuery library. Here is a minimalist skeleton implementation using the fewest lines of codes I could think of:Clipboard-polyfill library is a polyfill for the modern Promise-based asynchronous clipboard API.install in CLI:import as clipboard in JS fileexampleI'm using it in a bundle with require(\"babel-polyfill\"); and tested it on chrome 67. All good for production.html code hereJS CODE:you can copy an individual text apart from an HTML element's text.Pure JS, without inline onclick, for paired classes \"content - copy button\".

It is better explained by Ed Eliot on his blog, which also includes many examples.This is an area where CSS has never really had any solutions — you’re down to using <table> tags (or faking them using the CSS display:table* values), as that’s the only place where a “keep a bunch of elements the same height” was implemented.This works in all versions of Firefox, Chrome and Safari, Opera from at least version 8, and in IE from version 8.Using jQuery, you can do it in a super simple one-line-script.This is a bit more interesting. The technique is called Faux Columns.  More or less you don't actually set the actual height to be the same, but you rig up some graphical elements so they look the same height.I'm surprised that nobody has mentioned the (very old but reliable) Absolute Columns technique:\nhttp://24ways.org/2008/absolute-columns/In my opinion, it is far superior to both Faux Columns and One True Layout's technique.The general idea is that an element with position: absolute; will position against the nearest parent element that has position: relative;. You then stretch a column to fill 100% height by assigning both a top: 0px; and bottom: 0px; (or whatever pixels/percentages you actually need.) Here's an example:You can use Jquery's Equal Heights Plugin to accomplish, this plugins makes all the div of exact same height as other. If one of them grows and other will also grow.Here a sample of implementationHere is the linkhttp://www.cssnewbie.com/equalheights-jquery-plugin/ You could use Faux Columns. Basically it uses a background image in a containing DIV to simulate the two equal-height-DIVs. Using this technique also allowes you to add shadows, rounded corners, custom borders or other funky patterns to your containers.Only works with fixed-width boxes though.Well tested out and properly working in every browser.Just spotted this thread while searching for this very answer. I just made a small jQuery function, hope this helps, works like a charm:JAVASCRIPTHTMLThe modern way of doing this (which also avoids having to declare a <div class=\"row\"></div>-wrapper around every two items) would be to make use of a CSS grid. This also gives you easy control on the gaps between your item rows/columns.This question was asked 6 years ago, but it's still worthy to give a simple answer with flexbox layout nowadays.Just add the following CSS to the father <div>, it will work.The first two lines declare it will be displayed as flexbox. And flex-direction: row tells browsers that its children will be display in columns. And align-items: stretch will meet the requirement that all the children elements will stretch to the same height it one of them become higher.If you don't mind one of the divs being a master and dictating the height for both divs there is this:FiddleNo matter what, the div on the right will expand or squish&overflow to match the height of the div on the left.Both divs must be immediate children of a container, and have to specify their widths within it.Relevant CSS:I like to use pseudo elements to achieve this. You can use it as background of the content and let them fill the space.With these approach you can set margins between columns, borders, etc.I have tried almost all the mentioned methods above, but the flexbox solution won't work correctly with Safari, and the grid layout methods won't work correctly with older versions of IE.This solution fits all screens and is cross-browser compatible:The above method will equal cells height, and for the smaller screens like mobile or tablet, we can use the @media method mentioned above.Say you have a container with two divs inside and you want those two divs to have the same height.You would set 'display: flex' on the container as well as 'align-items: stretch'Then just give the child divs a 'min-height' of 100%See the code belowyou can use jQuery to achieve this easily.CSSjQueryHTMLYou'll need to include jQueryI know its been a long time but I share my solution anyway.\nThis is a jQuery trick.--- HTML ---- CSS--- JQUERYThe FiddleHTMLCSSThis is a jQuery plugin which sets the equal height for all elements on the same row(by checking the element's offset.top). So if your jQuery array contains elements from more than one row(different offset.top), each row will have a separated height, based on element with maximum height on that row.};I was having the same problem so i created this small function using jquery as jquery is part of every web application nowadays.You can call this function on page ready eventI hope this works for you.I recently came across this and didn't really like the solutions so I tried experimenting..mydivclass {inline-block; vertical-align: middle; width: 33%;}What I did here is to change the height to min-height and gave it a fixed value. if one of them is getting resized the other one will stay the same height. not sure if this is what you want"},

Adding fixed to the background seems to fix that - no need for height: 100%;E.g.:Here's what I did to solve this problem... it will show the gradient for the full length of the content, then simply fallback to the background color (normally the last color in the gradient).I've tested this in FireFox 3.6, Safari 4, and Chrome, I keep the background-color in the body for any browsers that for some reason don't support styling the HTML tag.I know I'm late to the party, but here's a more solid answer.All you need to do is use min-height: 100%; rather than height: 100%; and your gradient background will extend the entire height of the viewport without repeating, even if the content is scrollable.Like this:Setting html { height: 100%} can wreak havoc with IE. Here's an example (png). But you know what works great? Just set your background on the <html> tag. Background extends to the bottom and no weird scrolling behavior occurs.

The best way to make the border semi-transparent is with the rgba color format. For example, this would give a red border with 50% opacity:The problem with this approach is that some browsers do not understand the rgba format and will not display any border at all if this is the entire declaration. The solution is to provide two border declarations. The first with a fake opacity, and the second with the actual. If a browser is capable, it will use the second, if not, it will use the first.The first border declaration will be the equivalent color to a 50% opaque red border over a white background (although any graphics under the border will not bleed through).UPDATE: I've added \"background-clip: padding-box;\" to this answer (per  SooDesuNe's suggestion in the comments) to ensure the border remains transparent even if a solid background color is applied.It's easy, use a solid shadow with 0 offset:Also, if you set a border-radius to the element, it gives you pretty rounded bordersjsFiddle DemoAs others have mentioned: CSS-3 says that you can use the rgba(...) syntax to specify a border color with an opacity (alpha) value.  here's a quick example if you'd like to check it.  There's also this stackoverflow post, which suggests some other issues--namely, that the border renders on-top-of any background color (or background image) that you've specified; thus limiting the usefulness of border alpha in many cases.If you check your CSS coding with W3C validator, you will see if your CSS code is acceptable, even if it worked in the major browsers.Creating a transparent border via CSS, as written above, is not accepted by W3C standards, not even for CSS3. I used the direct input validator with the following CSS code, The results were, Unfortunate that the alpha value (the letter \"a\" at the end of \"rgb\") is not accepted by W3C as part of the border color values as yet. I do wonder why it is not standardized, since it works in all browsers. The only hitch is whether you want to stick to W3C standards or step aside from it to create something in CSS.To use W3C online CSS validator / Direct Input.Always a good idea to use a validator to check your work, it really helps finding small or even large errors in coding when your going cross-eyed after hours of coding work.*Not as far as i know there isn't what i do normally in this kind of circumstances is create a block beneath with a bigger size((bordersize*2)+originalsize) and make it transparent usinghere is an exampleUpdate:This answer is outdated, since after all this question is more than 8 years old. Today all up to date browsers support rgba, box shadows and so on. But this is a decent example how it was 8+ years ago.As an alternate solution that may work in some cases: change the border-style to dotted.Having alternating groups of pixels between the foreground color and the background color isn't the same as a continuous line of partially transparent pixels. On the other hand, this requires significantly less CSS and it is much more compatible across every browser without any browser-specific directives.Other answers deal with the technical aspect of the border-opacity issue, while I'd like to present a hack(pure CSS and HTML only). Basically create a container div, having a border div and then the content div.And then the CSS:(set content border to none, take care of positioning such that border thickness is accounted for)try this:And here comes our magical CSS..Check out the Demo here."},

Does such a tool exist? Is it possible to extend Firebug or Chrome Developer Tools to add this feature?I finally found some time to create this tool. You can install SnappySnippet from Github. It allows easy HTML+CSS extraction from the specified (last inspected) DOM node. Additionally, you can send your code straight to CodePen or JSFiddle. Enjoy!SnappySnippet is open source, and you can find the code on GitHub.Since I've learned quite a lot while making this, I've decided to share some of the problems I've experienced and my solutions to them, maybe someone will find it interesting.At first I've tried retrieving the original CSS rules (coming from CSS files on the website). Quite amazingly, this is very simple thanks to window.getMatchedCSSRules(), however, it didn't work out well. The problem was that we were taking only a part of the HTML and CSS selectors that were matching in the context of the whole document, which were not matching anymore in the context of an HTML snippet. Since parsing and modifying selectors didn't seem like a good idea, I gave up on this attempt.Then, I've started from something that @CollectiveCognition suggested - getComputedStyle(). However, I really wanted to separate CSS form HTML instead of inlining all styles.The solution here wasn't very beautiful but quite straightforward. I've assigned IDs to all nodes in the selected subtree and used that ID to create appropriate CSS rules.Assigning IDs to the nodes worked out nicely, however I found out that each of my CSS rules has ~300 properties making the whole CSS unreadable.\nTurns out that getComputedStyle() returns all possible CSS properties and values calculated for the given element. Some of them where empty, some had  browser default values. To remove default values I had to get them from the browser first (and each tag has different default values). The solution was to compare the styles of the element coming from the website with the same element inserted into an empty <iframe>. The logic here was that there are no style sheets in an empty <iframe>, so each element I've appended there had only default browser styles. This way I was able to get rid of most of the properties that were insignificant.Next thing I have spotted was that properties having shorthand equivalent were unnecessarily printed out (e.g. there was border: solid black 1px and then border-color: black;, border-width: 1px itd.).\nTo solve this I've simply created a list of properties that have shorthand equivalents and filtered them out from the results.The number of properties in each rule was significantly lower after the previous operation, but I've found that I sill had a lot of -webkit- prefixed properties that I've never hear of (-webkit-app-region? -webkit-text-emphasis-position?).\nI was wondering if I should keep any of these properties because some of them seemed useful (-webkit-transform-origin, -webkit-perspective-origin etc.). I haven't figured out how to verify this, though, and since I knew that most of the time these properties are just garbage, I decided to remove them all.The next problem I have spotted was that the same CSS rules are repeated over and over (e.g. for each <li> with the exact same styles there was the same rule in the CSS output created).\nThis was just a matter of comparing rules with each other and combining these that had exactly the same set of properties and values. As a result, instead of #LI_1{...}, #LI_2{...} I got #LI_1, #LI_2 {...}.Since I was happy with the result, I moved to HTML. It looked like a mess, mostly because the outerHTML property keeps it formatted exactly as it was returned from the server.\nThe only thing HTML code taken from outerHTML needed was a simple code reformatting. Since it's something available in every IDE, I was sure that there is a JavaScript library that does exactly that. And it turns out that I was right (jquery-clean). What's more, I've got unnecessary attributes removal extra (style, data-ng-repeat etc.).Since there is a chance that in some circumstances filters mentioned above may break CSS in the snippet, I've made all of them optional. You can disable them from the Settings menu.Webkit browsers (not sure about FireBug) allow you to copy the HTML of an element easily, so that's one part of the process out of the way.Running this (in the javascript console) prior to copying the HTML for an element will move all the computed styles for the parent element given, as well as all child elements, into the inline style attribute which will then be available as part of the HTML.It's a total hack and you'll have alot of \"junk\" css attributes to wade through, but should at least get your started.I originally asked this question I was looking for a Chrome (or FireFox) solution, but I stumbled across this feature in Internet Explorer developer tools. Pretty much what I'm looking for (except for the javascript)I've created this tool years ago for the same purpose:\nhttp://www.betterprogramming.com/htmlclipper.htmlYou're welcome to use and improve upon it.This can be done by Firebug Plugin called scrapbook You can check Javascript option in settingEdit:This can also help divclip is an updated \nversion of Florentin Sardan's\nhtmlclipperwith modern enhancements: ES5, HTML5, scoped CSS...you can programmatically extract a stylized div with:Enjoy.There is no plugins needed. It can be done very simply with Internet Explorer 11 native Developer Tools with just one click, very clean. Just right on an element and inspect that element, and right click on some block and choose \"Copy element with styles\". You can see it in the below image.It provides the css code very clean, like Lately I created a chrome extension \"eXtract Snippet\" for copying the inspected element, html and only the relevant css and media queries from a page. Note that this would give you the actual relevant CSS https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/extract-snippet/bfcjfegkgdoomgmofhcidoiampnpbdao?hl=en A tool with a single solution for this I'm unaware of, but you can use Firebug and Web Developer extension at the same time.Use Firebug to copy the html section you need (Inspect Element) and Web Developer to see which css is associated with an element (Calling Web Developer \"View Style Information\" - it works like Firebug's \"Inspect Element\", but instead of showing the html markup it shows the associated CSS with that markup).It's not exactly what you want (one click for everything), but it's pretty close, and at least intuitive.I also need this feature on Firebug!  Until then, another approach is to use this online service to remove classes and convert the css to inline styles.http://clipboardjs.com does this and quite well. Although your expectation of the copied version being exactly as in the original so you can play and learn with it, may not be realistic.Just copy the part you want from the webpage and paste it in the wysiwyg editor. Check the html source by clicking on the \"source\" button on the editor toolbar.I've found this most easiest way when I was working on a Drupal site.

I also tried increasing the height of the navbar class, but that screwed things up even more.By the way, my logo image is larger than the height of the navbar.Why is everyone trying to do it the hard way?  Sure, some of these approaches will work, but they're more complicated than is necessary.OK, first - you need an image that will fit within your navbar.  You can adjust your image via css height attribute (allowing width to scale) or you can just use an appropriately sized image.  Whatever you decide to do - the way this looks will depend on how well you size your image.For some reason, everyone wants to stick the image inside of an anchor with navbar-brand, and this isn't necessary.  navbar-brand applies text styles that aren't necessary to an image, as well as the navbar-left class (just like pull-left, but for use in a navbar).  All you really need is to add navbar-left.You can even follow this with a navbar-brand item, which will appear to the right of the image.There is currently a bug in Mozilla I discovered that breaks the navbar on certain browser widths with MANY DEMOS ON THIS PAGE. Basically the mozilla bug is including the left and right padding on the navbar brand link as part of the image width. However, this can be fixed easily and I've tested this out and I fairly sure it's the most stable working example on this page. It will resize automatically and works on all browsers. Just add this to your css and use navbar-brand the same way you would .img-responsive. Your logo will automatically fitAnother option is to use a background image. Use an image of any size and then just set the desired width:People seem to forget about object-fit a lot. Personally I think it's the easiest one to work with because the image automatically adjusts to the menu size. If you just use object fit on the image it will auto resize to the menus height.It was pointed out that this does not work in IE \"yet\". There is a polyfill, but that might be excessive if you don't plan on using it for anything else. It does look like object-fit is being planned for a future release of IE so once that happens this will work in all browsers. However, if you notice the .img-responsive class in bootstrap the max-width is assuming you are putting these images in columns or something that has an explicit with set. This would mean that 100% specifically means 100% width of the parent element. The reason we can't use that with the navbar is because the parent (.navbar-brand) has a fixed height of 50px, but the width is not set. If we take that logic and reverse it to be responsive based on the height we can have a responsive image that scales to the .navbar-brand height and by adding and auto set width it will adjust to proportion.Usually we would have to add display:block; to the scenario, but since navbar-brand already has float:left; applied to it, it automatically acts as a block element. You may run into the rare situation where your logo is too small. The img-responsive approach does not take this into account, but we will. By also adding the \"height\" attribute to the .navbar-brand > img you can be assured that it will scale up as well as down.So to complete this I put them both together and it seems to work perfectly in all browsers.Although your question is interesting i don't expect there will be one answer for it. Maybe your question is too broad.\nYour solution should depend on: other content in the navbar (number of items), sizes of your logo, should your logo act responsive, etc.\nAdding the logo in the a (with navbar-brand) seems a good starting point. I should use the navbar-brand class because this will add a padding (top / bottom) of 15 pixels.I test this setting on http://getbootstrap.com/examples/navbar/ with a logo of 300x150 pixels.Full screen > 1200:between 768 and 992 pixels (menu not collapsed):<768 (menu collapsed)Beside the aesthetic aspects i did not find any technical problem. On small screens a big logo will overlap or break out the viewport maybe.\nScreens between 768 and 992 pixels also have other problems when the content doesn't fit in a line, see for example: https://github.com/bassjobsen/jamedo-bootstrap-start-theme/issues/18The default navbar has The default navbar example adds a bottom-margin of 30px so the content of your navbar should never overlap the content of your page. (fixed navbars will have problems when the height of the navbar varies).You will need some css and media queries to adapt the navbar to your need on different screen sizes. Please try to narrow your question. b.e. describe the problem you found on android.update see http://bootply.com/77512 for an example.interchange the button and the logo in your code, logo first (set float:left on the logo)set the margin-top for .navbar-collapse ul. Use logo height minus navbar height, to align to the bottom or (logo height - navbar height) / 2 to centerExample with a logo 100px x 100px, standard CSS:ExampleWell I finally got this same problem working, here is my solution and I tested it on my site in all three major browsers: Chrome, Firefox, and Internet Explorer.First of all if you are not using a text based logo then remove \"navbar-brand\" completely as I found this particular class to be the main cause of my collapsed nav menu doubling up.Shout out to user3137032 for leading me in the right direction.You have to make a custom responsive image container, I called mine \"logo\"Here is the bootstrap HTML mark up:And the CSS code:The value in @media (max-width: x) may vary depending on your logo images width, mine is 368px.  The percentages may need to be changed as well depending on your logo's size.  The first @media query should be your threshold and mine was image width (368px) + collapsed button size (44px) + about 60px and it came out to 480px which is where I start the responsive image scaling.Please be sure to remove my razor syntax from the HTML portions.  Let me know if it fixes your problem, it fixed mine.Edit:  Sorry, I missed your navbar height issue.  There are a couple ways to go about it, personally I compile the Bootstrap LESS with the appropriate navbar height, for my purposes I use 70px, and my image height is 68 px.  The second way to do it is in the bootstrap.css file itself, search for \".navbar\" and change min-height: to the height of your logo.My solution is add css \"display: inline-block\" to img tag.DEMO: jsfiddleI use the img-responsive class and then set a max-width on the a element.  Like this:and the CSS:You must use code as this:Class of A tag must be \"logo\" not navbar-brand. It depends on how tall you want your logo to be.The default <a> height in the navbar is 20px, so if you specify height: 20px on your logo, it will allign nicely.However that's kind of small for a logo, so what I opted for was this:This makes the image 30px tall and vertically aligns the image by adding a negative margin to the top (5px is half of the difference between the padding on a and the size of the image).Alternately you could change the padding on the <a> element, eg:Quick Fix : Create a class for your logo and set the height to 28px. This works well with the navbar on all devices. Notice I said works \"WELL\" .My approach is to include FOUR different images of different sizes for phones, tablet, desktop, large desktop but only show ONE using bootstrap's responsive utility classes, as follow:Note: You can replace the commented line with the code provided. Replace the php code if you're not using wordpress.Edit Note2: Yes, this adds requests to your server when loading the page which might slow down a bit but if you use a background css sprite technique, chances are the logo doesn't get printed when printing a page and the code above should get better SEO.You shouldn't need to add additional CSS, since Bootstrap3 does provide it. Unless you do want to add it.\nThis is my code on putting the logo to the left and links to the right.\nThis navigation is responsive. Make changes to this as you see fit.HTML:I also implement it via css background property. It works healty in any width value.Another approach is to implement Bootstrap's built-in .text-hide class alongside of .navbar-brand to replace the brand text/content with a background image.CSS: HTML:This is a very consistent method and keeps your image centered. To adjust the size of the image all you need to do is adjust .navbar-brand width since the height is already set.Here's a live demo I had the same problem. I solved it like this:There is no navbar-brand class. The result looks like logo picture that fits navbar and works like a link. Also I recommend  to use navbar-right class for the menu items so they won't go below the logo.Maybe this is too simple, but I just copied the navbar-brand line so there are two of them, the image and then the text.And I created an image that fits inside the navbar (roughly 1/2 the height).If using LESS, this works:This code works perfect if you need to see the brand centered and with auto width in toolbar.\nIt contains the Wordpress function to get the image file from right path:my working code - bootstrap 3.0.3.\nwhen navbar-toggle, hidden-xs original logo image.You might try using @media query such as below.Add a logo class first, then use @media to specify your logo height and width per device size. In the example below, I am targeting devices which have a max width of 320px (iPhone) You can play around with this until you find the best fit. Easy way to test: Use chrome or Firefox with inspect element. Shrink your browser as far as possible. Observe the logo size change based on the @media max width you specify. Test on iPhone, android devices, iPad etc to get the desired results.Please try following code: Failing to make any of the other answers work in my case (I probably didn't pass the intelligence test) and after some experimentation, this is what I am using (which I believe is very close to the Bootstrap default):And in the CSS file I have added the following:Note that @Html.ActionLink() is Razor syntax for an <a> tag. Where it says @Html.ActionLink(...) just replace it with an appropriate <a> tag. Equally where it says @Url.Action(...) replace it with an appropriate URL (no <a> tag in that case).This isn't semantic but I just use the existing a element, set a background image, then create multiple variations for @2x resolution, smaller screen sizes, etc.Then, you can use the .text-hide class to get some text on the page the ol' fashion way. Simple and effective though not proper use of an image.Here's a link to the helper class for text-replacement: http://getbootstrap.com/css/#helper-classesThe easiest and best answer for this question is to set a max width and height depending on your logo, the image will be a max of 50px high but no longer than 200px.This will vary depending on your logo size and the nav bar items you have.Please understand the code at your own effort :D This is my draft code and its already working :) Here's the screenshot.In stead of replacing text branding, I divided into two rows like in the code below and gave img-responsive class to the image......and in addition,I added the following css codes.......If my code solves your problem, it's my pleasure.....//Don't forgot to add bootstrap in head of your code.Add the following to the .navbar-brand class"},

For precaution you can keep its height auto so it can be rendered as per content's height.For a clear view of these function you can go for jQuery's site or a detailed post here.it will clear the difference between .height() / innerHeight() / outerHeight()I use this:It also works when you use the virtual DOM. I use it in Vue like this:then simply: style.heightDefinitely use orI'm posting this as an additional answer because theres a couple important things I just learnt.I almost fell into the trap just now of using offsetHeight. This is what happened :Here's just a portion of it :Yup it looks at BOTH scroll and offset. If that fails it looks even further, taking into account browser and css compatibility issues. In other words STUFF I DONT CARE ABOUT - or want to.But I dont have to. Thanks jQuery! Moral of the story : if jQuery has a method for something its probably for a good reason, likely related to compatibilty.If you haven't read through the jQuery list of methods recently I suggest you take a look.I made a simple code that doesn't even need JQuery and probably gonna help some people.\nIt gets the total height of 'ID1' after loaded and use it on 'ID2'Then just set the body to load itHm we can get the Element geometry...How about this plain JS ?So is this the answer? \"If you need to calculate something but not show it, set the element to visibility:hidden and position:absolute, add it to the DOM tree, get the offsetHeight, and remove it. (That's what the prototype library does behind the lines last time I checked).\"I have the same problem on a number of elements.  There is no jQuery or Prototype to be used on the site but I'm all in favor of borrowing the technique if it works.  As an example of some things that failed to work, followed by what did, I have the following code:which basically tries anything and everything only to get a zero result. ClientHeight with no affect.  With the problem elements I typically get NaN in the Base and zero in the Offset and Scroll heights.  I then tried the Add DOM solution and clientRects to see if it works here.29 Jun 2011,\nI did indeed update the code to try both adding to DOM and clientHeight with better results than I expected.  1) clientHeight was also 0.2) Dom actually gave me a height which was great.3) ClientRects returns a result almost identical to the DOM technique.Because the elements added are fluid in nature, when they are added to an otherwise empty DOM Temp element they are rendered according to the width of that container.  This get weird, because that is 30px shorter than it eventually ends up.I added a few snapshots to illustrate how the height is calculated differently.\n\nThe height differences are obvious.   I could certainly add absolute positioning and hidden but I am sure that will have no effect.  I continued to be convinced this would not work!(I digress further) The height comes out (renders) lower than the true rendered height.  This could be addressed by setting the width of the DOM Temp element to match the existing parent and could be done fairly accurately in theory.  I also do not know what would result from removing them and adding them back into their existing location.  As they arrived through an innerHTML technique I will be looking using this different approach.* HOWEVER * None of that was necessary. In fact it worked as advertised and returned the correct height!!!When I was able to get the menus visible again amazingly DOM had returned the correct height per the fluid layout at the top of the page (279px).  The above code also uses getClientRects which return 280px.This is illustrated in the following snapshot (taken from Chrome once working.)\nNow I have noooooo idea why that prototype trick works, but it seems to.  Alternatively, getClientRects also works.I suspect the cause of all this trouble with these particular elements was the use of innerHTML instead of appendChild, but that is pure speculation at this point.I think the best way to do this in 2020 is to use plain js and getBoundingClientRect().height;Here's an exampleOn top of getting height this way, we also have access to a bunch of other stuff about the div.offsetHeight, usually.If you need to calculate something but not show it, set the element to visibility:hidden and position:absolute, add it to the DOM tree, get the offsetHeight, and remove it. (That's what the prototype library does behind the scenes last time I checked).Sometimes offsetHeight will return zero because the element you've created has not been rendered in the Dom yet. I wrote this function for such circumstances:If you are using jQuery already, your best bet is .outerHeight() or .height(), as has been stated.Without jQuery, you can check the box-sizing in use and add up various paddings + borders + clientHeight, or you can use getComputedStyle:var h = getComputedStyle(document.getElementById('someDiv')).height;h will now be a string like a \"53.825px\".And I can't find the reference, but I think I heard getComputedStyle() can be expensive, so it's probably not something you want to call on each window.onscroll event (but then, neither is jQuery's height()).With MooTools:$('someDiv').getSize().yIf i understood your question correctly, then maybe something like this would help:Have you set the height in the css specifically?

If you want to control the opacity of the dropshadow have a look at this example. The slope attribute controls how much opacity to give to the dropshadow.Relevant bits from the example:Box-shadow is defined to work on CSS boxes (read: rectangles), while svg is a bit more expressive than just rectangles. Read the SVG Primer to learn a bit more about what you can do with SVG filters.Use the new CSS filter property.Supported by webkit browsers, Firefox 34+ and Edge.You can use this polyfill that will support FF < 34, IE6+.You would use it like so:This approach differs from the box-shadow effect in that it accounts for opacity and does not apply the drop shadow effect to the box but rather to the corners of the svg element itself.Please Note: This approach only works when the class is placed on the <svg> element alone. You can NOT use this on an inline svg element such as <rect>.Read more about css filters on html5rocks.You can easily add a drop-shadow effect to an svg-element using the drop-shadow() CSS function and rgba color values. By using rgba color values you can change the opacity of your shadow.Easiest way I've found is with feDropShadow. I will never go back to using those incredibly esoteric filter tag names that I don't understand.I'm not aware of a CSS-only solution. As you mentioned, filters are the canonical approach to creating drop shadow effects in SVG. The SVG specification includes an example of this.Probably an evolution, it appears that inline css filters works nicely on elements, in a certain way. Declaring a drop-shadow css filter, in an svg element, in both a class or inline does NOT works, as specified earlier.But, at least in Firefox, with the following wizardry: Appending the filter declaration inline, with javascript, after DOM load.Another way, I used for white shadow (on text): create a clone for shadow:Note: This require xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" at SVG declaration.Real text value is located in <defs> section, with position and style, but without a fill definition.The text is cloned two times: first for shadow and second for the text itself.With same requirement: No fill definition at <defs> section!"},

One such consideration (but not the only one!) is allowing users to make the text of your site bigger, so that it's easier to read.In the beginning, the only way to provide users a way to scale text size was by using relative size units (such as ems).  This is because the browser's font size menu simply changed the root font size.  Thus, if you specified font sizes in px, they wouldn't scale when changing the browser's font size option.Modern browsers (and even the not-so-modern IE7) all changed the default scaling method to simply zooming in on everything, including images and box sizes.  Essentially, they make the reference pixel larger or smaller.Yes, someone could still change their browser default stylesheet to tweak the default font size (the equivalent of the old-style font size option), but that's a very esoteric way of going about it and I'd wager nobody1 does it.  (In Chrome, it's buried under the advanced settings, Web content, Font Sizes.  In IE9, it's even more hidden.  You have to press Alt, and go to View, Text Size.)  It's much easier to just select the Zoom option in the browser's main menu (or use Ctrl++/-/mouse wheel).1 - within statistical error, naturallyIf we assume most users scale pages using the zoom option, I find relative units mostly irrelevant.  It's much easier to develop your page when everything is specified in the same unit (images are all dealt with in pixels), and you don't have to worry about compounding.    (\"I was told there would be no math\" – there's dealing with having to calculate what 1.5em actually works out to.)One other potential problem of using only relative units for font sizes is that user-resized fonts may break assumptions your layout makes.  For example, this might lead to text getting clipped or running too long.  If you use absolute units, you don't have to worry about unexpected font sizes from breaking your layout.So my answer is use pixel units.  I use px for everything.  Of course, your situation may vary, and if you must support IE6 (may the gods of the RFCs have mercy on you), you'll have to use ems anyway.I would like to praise josh3736's answer for providing some excellent historical context. While it's well articulated, the CSS landscape has changed in the almost five years since this question was asked. When this question was asked, px was the correct answer, but that no longer holds true today.tl;dr: use remHistorically px units typically represented one device pixel. With devices having higher and higher pixel density this no longer holds for many devices, such as with Apple's Retina Display.rem units represent the root em size. It's the font-size of whatever matches :root. In the case of HTML, it's the <html> element; for SVG, it's the <svg> element. The default font-size in every browser* is 16px.At the time of writing, rem is supported by approximately 98% of users. If you're worried about that other 2%, I'll remind you that media queries are also supported by approximately 98% of users.The majority of CSS examples on the internet use px values because they were the de-facto standard. pt, in and a variety of other units could have been used in theory, but they didn't handle small values well as you'd quickly need to resort to fractions, which were longer to type, and harder to reason about.If you wanted a thin border, with px you could use 1px, with pt you'd need to use 0.75pt for consistent results, and that's just not very convenient.rem's default value of 16px isn't a very strong argument for its use. Writing 0.0625rem is worse than writing 0.75pt, so why would anyone use rem?There are two parts to rem's advantage over other units.Browser zoom has changed a lot over the years. Historically many browsers would only scale up font-size, but that changed pretty rapidly when websites realized that their beautiful pixel-perfect designs were breaking any time someone zoomed in or out. At this point, browsers scale the entire page, so font-based zooming is out of the picture.Respecting a user's wishes is not out of the picture. Just because a browser is set to 16px by default, doesn't mean any user can't change their preferences to 24px or 32px to correct for low vision or poor visibility (e.x. screen glare). If you base your units off of rem, any user at a higher font-size will see a proportionally larger site. Borders will be bigger, padding will be bigger, margins will be bigger, everything will scale up fluidly.If you base your media queries on rem, you can also make sure that the site your users see fits their screen. A user with font-size set to 32px on a 640px wide browser, will effectively be seeing your site as shown to a user at 16px on a 320px wide browser. There's absolutely no loss for RWD in using rem.Because rem is based on the font-size of the :root node, if you want to change what 1rem represents, all you have to do is change the font-size:Whatever you do, don't set the :root element's font-size to a px value.If you set the font-size on html to a px value, you've blown away the user's preferences without a way to get them back.If you want to change the apparent value of rem, use % units.The math for this is reasonably straight-forward.The apparent font-size of :root is 16px, but lets say we want to change it to 20px. All we need to do is multiply 16 by some value to get 20.Set up your equation:And solve for X:Doing everything in multiples of 20 isn't all that great, but a common suggestion is to make the apparent size of rem equal to 10px. The magic number for that is 10/16 which is 0.625, or 62.5%.The problem now is that your default font-size for the rest of the page is set way too small, but there's a simple fix for that: Set a font-size on body using rem:It's important to note, with this adjustment in place, the apparent value of rem is 10px which means any value you might have written in px can be converted directly to rem by bumping a decimal place.turns intoThe apparent font-size you choose is up to you, so if you want there's no reason you can't use:and have 1rem equal 1px.So there you have it, a simple solution to respect user wishes while also avoiding over-complicating your CSS.I was afraid you might ask that. As much as I'd like to pretend that rem is magic and solves-all-things, there are still some issues of note. Nothing deal-breaking in my opinion, but I'm going to call them out so you can't say I didn't warn you.One of the first issues you'll run into with rem involves media queries. Consider the following code:Here the value of rem changes depending on whether the media-query applies, and the media query depends on the value of rem, so what on earth is going on?rem in media queries uses the initial value of font-size and should not (see Safari section) take into account any changes that may have happened to the font-size of the :root element. In other words, it's apparent value is always 16px.This is a bit annoying, because it means that you have to do some fractional calculations, but I have found that most common media queries already use values that are multiples of 16.Additionally if you're using a CSS preprocessor, you can use mixins or variables to manage your media queries, which will mask the issue entirely.Unfortunately there's a known bug with Safari where changes to the :root font-size do actually change the calculated rem values for media query ranges. This can cause some very strange behavior if the font-size of the :root element is changed within a media query. Fortunately the fix is simple: use em units for media queries.If you switch between projects various different projects, it's quite possible that the apparent font-size of rem will have different values. In one project, you might be using an apparent size of 10px where in another project the apparent size might be 1px. This can be confusing and cause issues.My only recommendation here is to stick with 62.5% to convert rem to an apparent size of 10px, because that has been more common in my experience.If you're writing CSS that's going to be used on a site that you don't control, such as for an embedded widget, there's really no good way to know what apparent size rem will have. If that's the case, feel free to keep using px.If you still want to use rem though, consider releasing a Sass or LESS version of the stylesheet with a variable to override the scaling for the apparent size of rem.* I don't want to spook anyone away from using rem, but I haven't been able to officially confirm that every browser uses 16px by default. You see, there are a lot of browsers and it wouldn't be all that hard for one browser to have diverged ever so slightly to, say 15px or 18px. In testing, however I have not seen a single example where a browser using default settings in a system using default settings had any value other than 16px. If you find such an example, please share it with me.This article describes pretty well the pros and cons of px, em, and rem.The author finally concludes that the best method is probably to use both px and rem, declaring px first for older browsers and redeclaring rem for newer browsers:As a reflex answer, I would recommend using rem, because it allows you to change the \"zoom level\" of the whole document at once, if necessary. In some cases, when you want the size to be relative to the parent element, then use em.But rem support is spotty, IE8 needs a polyfill, and Webkit is exhibiting a bug. Moreover, sub-pixel calculation can cause things such as one pixel lines to sometimes disappear. The remedy is to code in pixels for such very small elements. That introduces even more complexity.So, overall, ask yourself whether it's worth it - how important and likely it is that you change the \"zoom level\" of the whole document within CSS?For some cases it's yes, for some cases it'll be no.So, it depends on your needs, and you have to weight pros and cons, because using rem and em introduces some additional considerations in comparison to the \"normal\" pixel-based workflow.Keep in mind that it's easy to switch (or rather convert) your CSS from px to rem (JavaScript is another story), because the following two blocks of CSS code would produce the same result:josh3736's answer is a good one, but to provide a counterpoint 3 years later:I recommend using rem units for fonts, if only because it makes it easier for you, the developer, to change sizes. It's true that users very rarely change the default font size in their browsers, and that modern browser zoom will scale up px units. But what if your boss comes to you and says \"don't enlarge the images or icons, but make all the fonts bigger\". It's much easier to just change the root font size and let all the other fonts scale relative to that, then to change px sizes in dozens or hundreds of css rules.I think it still makes sense to use px units for some images, or for certain layout elements that should always be the same size regardless of the scale of the design.Caniuse.com may have said that only 75% of browsers when josh3736 posted his answer in 2012, but as of March 27 they claim 93.78% support. Only IE8 doesn't support it among the browsers they track.I've found the best way to program the font sizes of a website are to define a base font size for the body and then use em's (or rem's) for every other font-size I declare after that.  That's personal preference I suppose, but it's served me well and also made it very easy to incorporate a more responsive design.As far as using rem units go, I think it's good to find a balance between being progressive in your code, but to also offer support for older browsers.  Check out this link about browser support for rem units, that should help out a good amount on your decision.pt is similar to rem, in that it's relatively fixed, but almost always DPI-independent, even when non-compliant browsers treat px in a device-dependent fashion.  rem varies with the font size of the root element, but you can use something like Sass/Compass to do this automatically with pt.If you had this:then 1rem would always be 12pt.  rem and em are only as device-independent as the elements on which they rely; some browsers don't behave according to spec, and treat px literally.  Even in the old days of the Web, 1 point was consistently regarded as 1/72 inch--that is, there are 72 points in an inch.If you have an old, non-compliant browser, and you have:then 1rem is going to be device-dependent.  For elements that would inherit from html by default, 1em would also be device-dependent.  12pt would be the hopefully guaranteed device-independent equivalent: 16px / 96px * 72pt = 12pt, where 96px = 72pt = 1in.It can get pretty complicated to do the math if you want to stick to specific units.  For example, .75em of html = .75rem = 9pt, and .66em of .75em of html = .5rem = 6pt.  A good rule of thumb:Yes, REM and PX are relative yet other answers have suggested to go for REM over PX, I would also like to back this up using an accessibility example.\nWhen user sets different font-size on browser, REM automatically scale up and down elements like fonts, images etc on the webpage which is not the case with PX.  In the below gif left side text is set using font size REM unit while right side font is set by PX unit.Default font-size of a webpage is 16px which is equal to 1 rem (only for default html page i.e. html{font-size:100%}), so, 1.25rem is equal to 20px.P.S: who else is using REM? CSS Frameworks! like Bootstrap 4, Bulma CSS etc, so better get along with it.Half (but only half) snarky answer (the other half is bitter disdain of the reality of bureaucracy):Use vhEverything is always sized to browser window. Always allow scroll down, never to the side.Set body width to be a static 50vh, and nothing floats or breaks out of the parent div. And style only using tables so everything is held rigidly into place as expected. Include a javascript function to undo any ctrl+/- activity the user may do.Everybody will hate you except the people who tell you to make things match their mock-up, and they will be ecstatic. And everyone knows their opinion is the only one that matters.Yes. Or, rather, no. Er, I mean, it doesn't matter. Use the one that makes sense for your particular project. PX and EM or both equally valid but will behave a bit different depending on your overall page's CSS architecture. UPDATE:To clarify, I'm stating that usually it likely doesn't matter which you use. At times, you may specifically want to choose one over the other. EMs are nice if you can start from scratch and want to use a base font size and make everything relative to that. PXs are often needed when you're retrofitting a redesign onto an existing code base and need the specificity of px to prevent bad nesting issues.em's are the way forward, not just for fonts but you can use them with boxes, line thickness and other stuff too, why?Put simply em's are the only ones that scale in unison with the alt+ and alt- keys in the browser for zooming.Other measurements scale, but not as cleanly as an em.On a side note if you want the best in scaling, also convert your graphics to vector based SVG where possible too as these will also cleanly scale with the browsers zoom ratio.EMs are the ONLY thing that scales for media queries that handle +/- scaling, which people do all the time, not just blind people. Here's another very well written professional demonstration of why this matters.By the way, this is why Zurb Foundation uses ems, while the inferior Bootstrap 3 still uses pixels."},

It really doesn't seem to serve much purpose. Could you give me an example of where the differences lie (and why it is important to know the difference)?", "url": "[Difference between margin and padding?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5958699/difference-between-margin-and-padding)", "vote": 359, "content": "What exactly is the difference between margin and padding in CSS? It really doesn't seem to serve much purpose. Could you give me an example of where the differences lie (and why it is important to know the difference)?padding is the space between the content and the border, whereas margin is the space outside the border. Here's an image I found from a quick Google search, that illustrates this idea.One key thing that is missing in the answers here:Top/Bottom margins are collapsible.So if you have a 20px margin at the bottom of an element and a 30px margin at the top of the next element, the margin between the two elements will be 30px rather than 50px. This does not apply to left/right margin or padding.Margin is applied to the outside of you element hence effecting how far your element is away from other elements.  Padding is applied to the inside of your element hence effecting how far your element's content is away from the border.Also, using margin will not affect your element's dimensions whereas padding will make your elements dimensions (set height + padding) so for example if you have a 100x100px div with a 5 px padding, your div will actually be 105x105pxRemember these 3 points:Demo Image:(where red box is desire control)\nThe simplest defenition is ;\n padding is a space given inside the border of the container element and margin is given outside. \nFor a element which is not a container, padding may not make much sense, but margin defenitly will help to arrange it.Padding is space inside the border, whereas Margin is space outside the border.PaddingPadding is a CSS property that defines the space between an element content and its border (if it has a border). If an element has a border around it, padding will give space from that border to the element content which appears in that border. If an element does not have a border around it, then adding padding has no effect at all on that element, because there is no border to give space from.MarginMargin is a CSS property that defines the space of outside of an element to its next outside element.Margin affects elements that both have or do not have borders. If an element has a border, margin defines the space from this border to the next outer element. If an element does not have a border, then margin defines the space from the element content to the next outer element.Difference Between Padding and MarginSo the difference between margin and padding is that while padding deals with the inner space, margin deals with the outer space to the next outer element.margin = space around (outside) the element from border outwards.padding = space around (inside) the element from text to border.see here: http://jsfiddle.net/robx/GaMpq/It is good to know about the differences between margin and padding. As I know:One of the key differences between margin and padding is not mentioned in any of the answers: clickability and hover detection  Increasing the padding increases the effective size of the element. Sometimes I have a smallish icon that I don't want to make visibly larger but the user still needs to interact with that icon.  I increase the icon's padding to give it a larger footprint for clicks and hover.  Increasing the icon's margin will not have the same effect.An answer to another question on this topic gives an example.Margin is space outside the box; padding is space inside the box. It's hard to see the difference with a white fill, but with a colored fill you can see it fine.Margin and padding are both types of padding really....One (margin) goes outside of the elements border to distance it from other elements and the other (padding) goes outside of the elements content to distance the content from the elements border.Padding allows the developer to maintain space between the text and it's enclosing element. Margin is the space that the element maintains with another element of the parent DOM.See example:Try putting a background color on a block div with width and height. You'll see that padding increases the size of the element, whereas margin just moves it within the flow of the document.Margin is specifically for shifting the element around.Padding is the space between nearest components on the web page and margin is the space from the margin of the webpage. Margin is a property in CSS that is used to create spaces around the elements, outside of the border. The programmer can set the margin for top, right, bottom and left. In other words, he can set those values using margin-top, margin-right, margin-bottom and margin-left.The Margin values can be of the following types.First, auto allows the browser to calculate the margin. Moreover, length denotes a margin in px, pt or cm, while % helps to describe a margin as a percentage relative to the width of the containing element. Finally, inherit denotes that the margin has to inherit from the parent element.Padding is a property in CSS that helps to create space around an element inside the border. The programmer can set the padding for top, right, bottom and left.  In other words, he can set those values using padding-top, padding-right, padding-bottom and padding-left.The Padding  values can be of the following types.  The length describes padding in px, pt or cm, while % denotes padding as a percentage relative to the width of the containing element. Finally, inherit describes that the padding should be inherited from the parent element.Difference Between Margin and PaddingMargin is a CSS property that is used to create space around the element outside the defined border, while the padding is a CSS property that is used to create space around the element, inside the defined border. Thus, this explains the main difference between margin and padding.Values\nFurthermore, the values of margin can be auto, length, % or inherit, whereas the values of padding can be length, % or inherit type. Hence, this is another difference between margin and padding.In brief, margin and padding are two properties in CSS that allows styling the web pages. It is not possible to assign negative values for those properties. The main difference between margin and padding is that margin helps to create space around the element outside the border, while padding helps to create space around the element inside the border.One thing I just noticed but none of above answers mentioned.  If I have a dynamically created DOM element which is initialized with empty inner html content, it's a good practice to use margin instead of padding if you don't want this empty element occupy any space except its content is created.There is one important difference:Margin- is on the outside of the element i.e. one will apply the whitespace shift \"after\" the element begins.\nPadding- is on the inside, the other will apply the whitespace \"before\" the element begins.Margin is applied to the outside of you element hence effecting how far your element is away from other elements.Padding is applied to the inside of your element hence effecting how far your element's content is away from the border.Also, using margin will not affect your element's dimensions whereas padding will make your elements dimensions (set height + padding) so for example if you have a 100x100px div with a 5 px padding, your div will actually be 105x105pxBasically, the difference between padding and margin come in terms of the background. Padding will decide the space between content, while margin decide the outside edge of elements!Padding is the space between you content and the border. Where as Margin is the space between the border and the other element."},

I want to disable specific clicky-things so that:How can I do this?Buttons are simple to disable as disabled is a button property which is handled by the browser:To disable these with a custom jQuery function, you'd simply make use of fn.extend():JSFiddle disabled button and input demo.Otherwise you'd make use of jQuery's prop() method:It's worth noting that disabled isn't a valid property for anchor tags. For this reason, Bootstrap uses the following styling on its .btn elements:Note how the [disabled] property is targeted as well as a .disabled class. The .disabled class is what is needed to make an anchor tag appear disabled.Of course, this will not prevent links from functioning when clicked. The above link will take us to http://example.com. To prevent this, we can add in a simple piece of jQuery code to target anchor tags with the disabled class to call event.preventDefault():We can toggle the disabled class by using toggleClass():JSFiddle disabled link demo.We can then extend the previous disable function made above to check the type of element we're attempting to disable using is(). This way we can toggleClass() if it isn't an input or button element, or toggle the disabled property if it is:Full combined JSFiddle demo.It's worth further noting that the above function will also work on all input types.I can't think a simpler/easier way! ;-)Using Anchor tags (Links) :To enable the Anchor tag:To disable the Anchor tag:Suppose you have text field and submit button,To disable any button, for example, submit button you just need to add disabled attribute as,After executing above line, your submit button html tag would look like this:Notice the 'disabled' attribute has added.For enabling button, such as when you have some text in text field. You will need to remove the disable attribute to enable button as,Now the above code will remove the 'disabled' attribute.I know I'm late to the party, but to specifically answer the two questions:\"I just want to disable specific clicky-things so that:How hard can this be?\"They stop clicking1.  For buttons like <button> or <input type=\"button\"> you add the attribute: disabled.2.  For links, ANY link... actually, any HTML element, you can use CSS3 pointer events.Browser support for pointer events is awesome by today's state of the art (5/12/14). But we usually have to support legacy browsers in the IE realm, so IE10 and below DO NOT support pointer events: http://caniuse.com/pointer-events. So using one of the JavaScript solutions mentioned by others here may be the way to go for legacy browsers.More info about pointer events:They look disabledObviously this a CSS answer, so: 1.  For buttons like <button> or <input type=\"button\"> use the [attribute] selector:--Here's a basic demo with the stuff I mentioned here: http://jsfiddle.net/bXm5B/4/Hope this helps.If, like me, you just want to disable a button, don't miss the simple answer subtly hidden in this long thread:@James Donnelly has supplied a comprehensive answer that relies on extending jQuery with a new function. That is a great idea, so I am going to adapt his code so it works the way I need it to.Extending jQueryUsageThe code will process a single element or a list of elements.Buttons and Inputs support the disabled property and, if set to true, they will look disabled (thanks to bootstrap) and will not fire when clicked. Anchors don't support the disabled property so instead we are going to rely on the .disabled class to make them look disabled (thanks to bootstrap again) and hook up a default click event that prevents the click by returning false (no need for preventDefault see here). Note: You do not need to unhook this event when re-enabling anchors. Simply removing the .disabled class does the trick. Of course, this does not help if you have attached a custom click handler to the link, something that is very common when using bootstrap and jQuery. So to deal with this we are going tro use the isDisabled() extension to test for the .disabled class, like this:I hope that helps simplify things a bit.Note that there's a weird problem if you're using Bootstrap's JS buttons and the 'loading' state. I don't know why this happens, but here's how to fix it.Say you have a button and you set it to the loading state:Now you want to take it out of the loading state, but also disable it (e.g. the button was a Save button, the loading state indicated an ongoing validation and the validation failed). This looks like reasonable Bootstrap JS:Unfortunately, that will reset the button, but not disable it. Apparently, button() performs some delayed task. So you'll also have to postpone your disabling:A bit annoying, but it's a pattern I'm using a lot.Great answer and contributions from all! I had to extend this function slightly to include disabling of select elements:Seems to be working for me. Thanks all!For that kind of behavior I always use the jQueryUI button widget, I use it for links and buttons.Define the tag within HTML:Use jQuery to initialize the buttons:Use the button widget methods to disable/enable them:That will take care of the button and cursor behavior, but if you need to get deeper and change the button style when disabled then overwrite the following CSS classes within your page CSS style file.But remember: those CSS classes (if changed) will change the style for other widgets too.The following has worked for me very well:This is a rather late answer, however I stumbled upon this question while searching for a way to disable boostrap buttons after clicking them and maybe add a nice effect (f.e a spinner). I've found a great library that does exactly that:http://msurguy.github.io/ladda-bootstrap/You just include the required css and js, add some properties to your buttons and enable lada with javascript... Presto ! Your buttons have a new life (please check the demo to see how beautiful it is) !This above does not work because sometimes adjust your code withI know my answer is late, but IMO this is the easiest way to toggle a Button 'enable' and button 'disable'Suppose you have these buttons on page like :The js code:Say you have that looks like this that is currently enable.Just add this:and you will get this which will disable button"},

By default flex-basis is auto.  From the spec:Each flex item has a flex-basis which is sort of like its initial size.  Then from there, any remaining free space is distributed proportionally (based on flex-grow) among the items.  With auto, that basis is the contents size (or defined size with width, etc.).  As a result, items with bigger text within are being given more space overall in your example.If you want your elements to be completely even, you can set flex-basis: 0.  This will set the flex basis to 0 and then any remaining space (which will be all space since all basises are 0) will be proportionally distributed based on flex-grow.This diagram from the spec does a pretty good job of illustrating the point.And here is a working example with your fiddle.To create elements with equal width using Flex, you should set to your's child (flex elements):It will give to all elements in row 25% width. They will not grow and go one by one."},

There is a CSS3 property for this, namely background-size (compatibility check). While one can set length values, it's usually used with the special values contain and cover.

We could set the background-size property to some fixed length, but we will focus on contain and cover.

When you hide the modal, revert it to automatic. Here is the code:You could try setting body size to window size with overflow: hidden when modal is openWarning: The option below is not relevant to Bootstrap v3.0.x, as scrolling in those versions has been explicitly confined to the modal itself.  If you disable wheel events you may inadvertently prevent some users from viewing the content in modals that have heights greater than the viewport height.The scroll event is not cancelable.  However it is possible to cancel the mousewheel and wheel events.  The big caveat is that not all legacy browsers support them, Mozilla only recently adding support for the latter in Gecko 17.0.  I don't know the full spread, but IE6+ and Chrome do support them.Here's how to leverage them:You need to go beyond @charlietfl's answer and account for scrollbars, otherwise you may see a document reflow.Inspired by: http://jdsharp.us/jQuery/minute/calculate-scrollbar-width.phpCouldn't make it work on Chrome just by changing CSS, because I didn't want the page to scroll back to the top. This worked fine:Try this one:it worked for me. (supports IE8)Adding the class 'is-modal-open' or modifying style of body tag with javascript is okay and it will work as supposed to. But the problem we gonna face is when the body becomes overflow:hidden, it will jump to the top, ( scrollTop will become 0 ). This will become a usability issue later. As a solution for this problem, instead of changing body tag overflow:hidden change it on html tagHope this helps...I'm not sure about this code, but it's worth a shot.In jQuery:As I said before, I'm not 100% sure but try anyway.As of November 2017 Chrome Introduced a new css propertyoverscroll-behavior: contain;which solves this problem although as of writing has limited cross browser support.see below links for full details and browser support Many suggest \"overflow: hidden\" on the body, which will not work (not in my case at least), since it will make the website scroll to the top.This is the solution that works for me (both on mobile phones and computers), using jQuery:This will make the scrolling of the modal to work, and prevent the website from scrolling at the same time.You could use the following logic, I tested it and it works(even in IE) The best solution is the css-only body{overflow:hidden} solution used by most of these answers.  Some answers provide a fix that also prevent the \"jump\" caused by the disappearing scrollbar; however, none were too elegant.  So, I wrote these two functions, and they seem to work pretty well.Check out this jsFiddle to see it in use.I'm not 100% sure this will work with Bootstrap but worth a try - it worked with Remodal.js which can be found on github: http://vodkabears.github.io/remodal/ and it would make sense for the methods to be pretty similar.To stop the page jumping to the top and also prevent the right shift of content add a class to the body when the modal is fired and set these CSS rules:It's the position:static and the height:auto that combine to stop the jumping of content to the right. The overflow-y:hidden; stops the page from being scrollable behind the modal.Based on this fiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/dh834zgw/1/the following snippet (using jquery) will disable the window scroll:And in your css:Now when you remove the modal, don't forget to remove the noscroll class on the html tag:I had a sidebar that was generated by checkbox hack.\nBut the main idea is to save the document scrollTop and not to change it during scrolling the window.I just didn't like the page jumping when body becomes 'overflow: hidden'.Sadly none of the answers above fixed my issues.In my situation, the web page originally has a scroll bar. Whenever I click the modal, the scroll bar won't disappear and the header will move to right a bit.Then I tried to add .modal-open{overflow:auto;} (which most people recommended). It indeed fixed the issues: the scroll bar appears after I open the modal. However, another side effect comes out which is that \"background below the header will move to the left a bit, together with another long bar behind the modal\"Luckily, after I add {padding-right: 0 !important;}, everything is fixed perfectly. Both the header and body background didn't move and the modal still keeps the scrollbar.Hope this can help those who are still stuck with this issue. Good luck!Most of the pieces are here, but I don't see any answer that puts it all together.The problem is threefold.(1) prevent the scroll of the underlying page(2) and remove the scroll bar(3) clean up when the modal is dismissedIf the modal is not full-screen then apply the .modal bindings to a full screen overlay.My solution for Bootstrap 3:because for me the only overflow: hidden on the body.modal-open class did not prevent the page from shifting to the left due to the original margin-right: 15px.I just done it this way ...But when the scroller dissapeared it moved everything right 20px, so i added straight after it.Works for me.If modal are 100% height/width \"mouseenter/leave\" will work to easily enable/disable scrolling. This really worked out for me:worked for meWhy not to do that as Bulma does?\nWhen modal is-active then add to html their class .is-clipped which is overflow: hidden!important;\nAnd thats it.Edit: Okey, Bulma has this bug, so you must add also other things likeSince for me this problem presented mainly on iOS, I provide the code to fix that only on iOS:None of the above answers worked perfectly for me. So I found another way which works well.  Just add a scroll.(namespace) listener and set scrollTop of the document to the latest of it's value...and also remove the listener in your close script.seems, this does not work well on chrome. any suggestion to fix it ?This worked for me:For those wondering how to get the scroll event for the bootstrap 3 modal:"},

[if someone knows how to fix this i'd really like to know :) ]    <-- FIXED HEREOther posts have mentioned flexbox, but if more than one row of items is necessary, flexbox's space-between property fails (see the end of the post)To date, the only clean solution for this is with theBasically the relevant code necessary boils down to this:1) Make the container element a grid container2) Set the grid with an 'auto' amount of columns - as necessary. This is done for responsive layouts. The width of each column will be 120px. (Note the use of auto-fit (as apposed to auto-fill) which (for a 1-row layout) collapses empty tracks to 0 - allowing the items to expand to take up the remaining space. (check out this demo to see what I'm talking about) ).3) Set gaps/gutters for the grid rows and columns - here, since want a 'space-between' layout - the gap will actually be a minimum gap because it will grow as necessary.4) and 5) - Similar to flexbox.Currently supported by Chrome (Blink), Firefox, Safari and Edge! ... with partial support from IE (See this post by Rachel Andrew)\nFlexbox's space-between property works great for one row of items, but when applied to a flex container which wraps it's items - (with flex-wrap: wrap) - fails, because you have no control over the alignment of the last row of items;\nthe last row will always be justified (usually not what you want)To demonstrate:Codepen (Resize to see what i'm talking about)Further reading on CSS grids:This worked for me with 5 images in diferent sizes.This works because of justify-content:space-between, and it's on a list, displayed horizontally. On CSS       On htmlin jQuery you might target the Parent directly.This will let the parent grow horizontally as the children are beng added.NOTE: This assumes that the '.children' have a width and Height SetHope that Helps.If you know the number of elements per \"row\" and the width of the container you can use a selector to add a margin to the elements you need to cause a justified look.I had rows of three divs I wanted justified so used the: .tile:nth-child(3n+2) { margin: 0 10px }this allows the center div in each row to have a margin that forces the 1st and 3rd div to the outside edges of the containerAlso great for other things like borders background colors etc"},

In my case I needed to find the <ul> parent tag for a <span> tag contained in the child <li>. jQuery has the :has selector so it's possible to identify a parent by the children it contains (updated per @Afrowave's comment ref: https://api.jquery.com/has-selector/):will select the ul element that has a child element with id someId. Or to answer the original question, something like the following should do the trick (untested):Right now, there is no option to select the parent of an element in CSS (not even CSS3). But with CSS4, the most important news in the current W3C draft is the support for the parent selector.Using the above, when hovering an list element, the whole unordered list will be highlighted by adding a white background to it.Official documentation: https://www.w3.org/TR/2011/WD-selectors4-20110929/#overview (last row).The first draft of Selectors Level 4 outlines a way to explicitly set the subject of a selector. This would allow the OP to style the list element with the selector $li > a.activeFrom Determining the Subject of a Selector:Edit: Given how \"drafty\" a draft spec can be, it's best to keep tabs on this by checking the CSSWG's page on selectors level 4.New CSS Specs contain an experimental :has pseudo selector that might be able to do this thing.The browser support on this is basically non-existent at this time, but it is in consideration on the official specs.While it is true that CSS cannot ASCEND, it is incorrect that you cannot grab the parent element of another element. Let me reiterate:Using your HTML example code, you are able to grab the li without specifying liIn this example, the ul is the parent of some element and that element is the parent of anchor. The downside of using this method is that if there is a ul with any child element that contains an anchor, it inherits the styles specified.You may also use the child selector as well since you'll have to specify the parent element anyway.In this example, the anchor must be a descendant of an li that MUST be a child of ul, meaning it must be within the tree following the ul declaration. This is going to be a bit more specific and will only grab a list item that contains an anchor AND is a child of ul.SO, to answer your question by code.This should grab the ul with the class of menu, and the child list item that contains only an anchor with the class of active.I had the same problem with Drupal. Given the limitations of CSS, the way to get this working is to add the \"active\" class to the parent elements when the menu HTML is generated. There's a good discussion of this at http://drupal.org/node/219804, the upshot of which is that this functionality has been rolled in to version 6.x-2.x of the nicemenus module. As this is still in development, I've backported the patch to 6.x-1.3 at http://drupal.org/node/465738 so that I can continue to use the production-ready version of the module.Many people answered with jQuery parent, but just to add on to that I wanted to share a quick snippet of code that I use for adding classes to my navs so I can add styling to li's that only have sub-menus and not li's that don't.I actually ran into the same issue as the original poster.  There is a simple solution of just using .parent() jQuery selector.  My problem was, I was using .parent instead of .parent(). Stupid mistake I know.Bind the events (in this case since my tabs are in Modal I needed to bind them with .live instead of a basic .click.Here is the HTML..Of course you can repeat that pattern..with more LI'sAnother thought occurred to me just now that could be a pure CSS solution. Display your active class as an absolutely positioned block and set its style to cover up the parent li.For those of you who want to use javascript without jquery...Selecting the parent is trivial. You need a getElementsByClass function of some sort, unless you can get your drupal plugin to assign the active item an ID instead of Class. The function I provided I grabbed from some other genius on SO. It works well, just keep in mind when you're debugging that the function will always return an array of nodes, not just a single node."},

Is it possible at all to have onclick behavior in CSS (i.e. without using JavaScript)?The closest you'll get is :active:However this will only apply the style when the mouse button is held down. The only way to apply a style and keep it applied onclick is to use a bit of JavaScript.The best way (actually the only way*) to simulate an actual click event using only CSS (rather than just hovering on an element or making an element active, where you don't have mouseUp) is to use the checkbox hack. It works by attaching a label to an <input type=\"checkbox\"> element via the label's for=\"\" attribute. This feature has broad browser support (the :checked pseudo-class is IE9+).Apply the same value to an <input>'s ID attribute and an accompanying <label>'s for=\"\" attribute, and you can tell the browser to re-style the label on click with the :checked pseudo-class, thanks to the fact that clicking a label will check and uncheck the \"associated\" <input type=\"checkbox\">.* You can simulate a \"selected\" event via the :active or :focus pseudo-class in IE7+ (e.g. for a button that's normally 50px wide, you can change its width while active: #btnControl:active { width: 75px; }), but those are not true \"click\" events. They are \"live\" the entire time the element is selected (such as by Tabbing with your keyboard), which is a little different from a true click event, which fires an action on - typically - mouseUp.Here I've positioned the label right after the input in my markup. This is so that I can use the adjacent sibling selector (the + key) to select only the label that immediately follows my #demo checkbox. Since the :checked pseudo-class applies to the checkbox, #demo:checked + label will only apply when the checkbox is checked. With that being said, there is some bad news. Because a label can only be associated with one form control at a time, that means you can't just drop a button inside the <label></label> tags and call it a day. However, we can use some CSS to make the label look and behave fairly close to how an HTML button looks and behaves.Most of the CSS in this demo is just for styling the label element. If you don't actually need a button, and any old element will suffice, then you can remove almost all of the styles in this demo, similar to my second demo above.You'll also notice I have one prefixed property in there, -moz-outline-radius. A while back, Mozilla added this awesome non-spec property to Firefox, but the folks at WebKit decided they aren't going to add it, unfortunately. So consider that line of CSS just a progressive enhancement for people who use Firefox.You can use pseudo class :target to mimic on click event, let me give you an example.Here's how it looks like: http://jsfiddle.net/TYhnb/One thing to note, this is only limited to hyperlink, so if you need to use on other than hyperlink, such as a button, you might want to hack it a little bit, such as styling a hyperlink to look like a button.If you give the element a tabindex then you can use the :focus pseudo class to simulate a click.HTMLCSShttp://jsfiddle.net/NaTj5/Edit: Answered before OP clarified what he wanted. The following is for an onclick similar to javascripts onclick, not the :active pseudo class.This can only be achieved with either Javascript or the Checkbox HackThe checkbox hack essentially gets you to click on a label, that \"checks\" a checkbox, allowing you to style the label as you wish.The demoTylerH made a really good answer, and I just had to give that last button version an update.How about a pure CSS solution without being (that) hacky?\n@TylerH has a great response but its a pretty complex solution.  I have a solution for those of you that just want a simple \"onclick\" effect with pure css without a bunch of extra elements.We will simply use css transitions.  You could probably do similar with animations. The trick is to change the delay for the transition so that it will last when the user clicks.  Here I add the \"clicked\" class as well so that javascript can also provide the effect if it needs to.  I use 0px drop-shadow filter because it will highlight the given transparent graphic blue this way for my case.I have a filter at 0s here so that it wont take effect.  When the effect is released I can then add the transition with a delay so that it will provide a nice \"clicked\" effect. This allows me to set it up so that when the user clicks the button, it highlights blue then fades out slowly (you could, of course, use other effects as well). While you are limited here in the sense that the animation to highlight is instant, it does still provide the desired effect.  You could likely use this trick with animation to produce a smoother overall transition.Okay, this maybe an old post... but was first result in google and decided to make your own mix on this as..FIRSTLY I WILL USE FOCUSThe reason for this is that it works nicely for the example i'm showing, if someone wants a mouse down type event then use activeTHE HTML CODE:THE CSS CODE:JS FIDDLE LINK: http://jsfiddle.net/00wwkjux/So why am i posting this in an old thread, well because the examples here vary and i thought to provide one back to the community which is a working example.As already answered by the thread creator, they only want the effect to last during the click event.

Particularly simple answer below!  :)You actually can have a change that persists (such as a block/popup that appears and stays visible after a click) with only CSS (and without using the checkbox hack) despite what many of the (otherwise correct) answers here claim, as long as you only need persistence during the hover.So take a look at Bojangles and TylerH's answers if those work for you, but if you want a simple and CSS only answer that will keep a block visible after being clicked on (and even can have the block disappear with a followup click), then see this solution.I had a similar situation, I needed a popup div with onClick where I couldn't add any JS or change the markup/HTML (a truly CSS solution) and this is possible with some caveats.  You can't use the :target trick that can create a nice popup unless you can change the HTML (to add an 'id') so that was out.In my case the popup div was contained inside the other div, and I wanted the popup to appear on top of the other div, and this can be done using a combination of :active and :hover:Example (as well as one that allows clicking on the popup to make it disappear) at:http://davesource.com/Solutions/20150324.CSS-Only-Click-to-Popup-Div/I've also inserted a code snippet example below, but the positioning in the stackoverflow sandbox is weird so I had to put the 'click here' text after the innerDiv, which isn't normally needed.I have the below code for mouse hover and mouse click and it works:and this code hides the image when you click on it:I had a problem with an element which had to be colored RED on hover and be BLUE on click while being hovered. To achieve this with css you need for example: I struggled for some time until I discovered that the order of CSS selectors was the problem I was having. The problem was that I switched the places and the active selector was not working. Then I found out that :hover to go first and then :active.you can use :targetfor general targetor filter by class nameor filter by id name"},

The green parts are the potential thought how this problem can be solved.Solution 1that means I can add float:left to either #outer or #inner demo1.also notice that float would invalidate the auto in margin.Solution 2other than visible, let's put overflow: hidden into #outer. And this way seems pretty simple and decent. I like it.Solution 3or these two methods will break the normal flow of divSolution 4is the same as @enderskillSolution 5This has not much work to do with the question since it is the collapsing margin between siblings. it generally means if a top-box has margin-bottom: 30px and a sibling-box has margin-top: 10px. The total margin between them is 30px instead of 40px.Solution 6This is very interesting and I can just add one top border lineAnd Also <div> is block-level in default, so you don't have to declare it on purpose.

But anyways I tried the original code pasted in the Question on IE9 and latest Google Chrome and they already give the desirable effect without any modifications.Use padding-top:50pxfor outer div. Something like this:Note: padding will increase the size of your div. In this case if the size of your div is important, I mean if it must have a specific height. decrease the height by 50px.:Have you tried !important before all, it will force everything:Just for a quick fix, try wrapping your child elements into a div element like this -Margin of inner div won't collapse due to the padding of 1px in-between outer and inner div. So logically you will have 1px extra space along with existing margin of inner div."},

I wanted to use jQuery. You pointed me in the right direction, and this is what I ended up with:Here is a link to the plugin: https://plugins.jquery.com/textfill/\nAnd a link to the source: http://jquery-textfill.github.io/and my html is like thisThis is my first jquery plugin, so it's probably not as good as it should be. Pointers are certainly welcome.I didn't find any of the previous solutions to be adequate enough due to bad performance, so I made my own that uses simple math instead of looping. Should work fine in all browsers as well.According to this performance test case it is much faster then the other solutions found here.If you want to contribute I've added this to Gist.As much as I love the occasional upvotes I get for this answer (thanks!), this is really not the greatest approach to this problem. Please check out some of the other wonderful answers here, especially the ones that have found solutions without looping.Still, for the sake of reference, here's my original answer:And here's a version with classes:Most of the other answers use a loop to reduce the font-size until it fits on the div, this is VERY slow since the page needs to re-render the element each time the font changes size. I eventually had to write my own algorithm to make it perform in a way that allowed me to update its contents periodically without freezing the user browser. I added some other functionality (rotating text, adding padding) and packaged it as a jQuery plugin, you can get it at:https://github.com/DanielHoffmann/jquery-bigtextsimply calland it will fit nicely on your container.See it in action here:http://danielhoffmann.github.io/jquery-bigtext/For now it has some limitations, the div must have a fixed height and width and it does not support wrapping text into multiple lines.I will work on getting an option to set the maximum font-size.Edit: I have found some more problems with the plugin, it does not handle other box-model besides the standard one and the div can't have margins or borders. I will work on it.Edit2: I have now fixed those problems and limitations and added more options. You can set maximum font-size and you can also choose to limit the font-size using either width, height or both. I will work into accepting a max-width and max-height values in the wrapper element.Edit3: I have updated the plugin to version 1.2.0. Major cleanup on the code and new options (verticalAlign, horizontalAlign, textAlign) and support for inner elements inside the span tag (like line-breaks or font-awesome icons.)This is based on what GeekyMonkey posted above, with some modifications.Here's an improved looping method that uses binary search to find the largest possible size that fits into the parent in the fewest steps possible (this is faster and more accurate than stepping by a fixed font size). The code is also optimized in several ways for performance.By default, 10 binary search steps will be performed, which will get within 0.1% of the optimal size. You could instead set numIter to some value N to get within 1/2^N of the optimal size.Call it with a CSS selector, e.g.: fitToParent('.title-span');I've created a directive for AngularJS - heavely inspired by GeekyMonkey's answer but without the jQuery dependency.Demo: http://plnkr.co/edit/8tPCZIjvO3VSApSeTtYr?p=previewMarkup<div class=\"fittext\" max-font-size=\"50\" text=\"Your text goes here...\"></div>DirectiveI forked the script above from Marcus Ekwall: https://gist.github.com/3945316 and tweaked it to my preferences, it now fires when the window is resized, so that the child always fits its container. I've pasted the script below for reference.Here's my modification of the OP's answer.In short, many people who tried to optimize this complained that a loop was being used. Yes, while loops can be slow, other approaches can be inaccurate.Therefore, my approach uses Binary Search to find the best Font Size:This also allows the element to specify the minimum and maximum font:Furthermore, this algorithm is unitless. You may specify em, rem, %, etc. and it will use that for its final result.Here's the Fiddle: https://jsfiddle.net/fkhqhnqe/1/I had exactly the same problem with my website. I have a page that is displayed on a projector, on walls, big screens..As I don't know the max size of my font, I re-used the plugin above of @GeekMonkey but incrementing the fontsize :Here is a version of the accepted answer which can also take a minFontSize parameter.You can use FitText.js (github page) to solve this problem. Is really small and efficient compared to TextFill. TextFill uses an expensive while loop and FitText don't. Also FitText is more flexible (I use it in a proyect with very special requirements and works like a champ!).HTML:You also can set options to it:CSS:And if you need it, FitText also has a no-jQuery version.EDIT: This code was used to show notes on top of a HTML5 video. It changes the font-size on the fly when the video is resized (when the browser window is resized.) The notes was connected to the video (just like notes on YouTube), which is why the code uses instances instead of a DOM handle directly.As per request I'll throw in some code that I used to achieve this. (Text boxes over an HTML5 video.) The code was written a long time ago, and I quite frankly think it's pretty messy. Since the question is already answered and an answer is already accepted a long time ago I don't bother rewriting this. But if anyone wants to simplify this a bit, you're more than welcome!You'll probably need to tweak these numbers from font-family to font-family. A good way to do this is download a free graph visualizer called GeoGebra. Change the length of the text and the size of the box. Then you manually set the size. Plot the manual results into the coordinate system. Then you enter the two equations I've posted here and you tweak the numbers until \"my\" graph fits your own manually plotted points.The proposed iterative solutions can be sped up dramatically on two fronts:1) Multiply the font size by some constant, rather than adding or subtracting 1.2) First, zero in using a course constant, say, double the size each loop.  Then, with a rough idea of where to start, do the same thing with a finer adjustment, say, multiply by 1.1.  While the perfectionist might want the exact integer pixel size of the ideal font, most observers don't notice the difference between 100 and 110 pixels.  If you are a perfectionist, then repeat a third time with an even finer adjustment.Rather than writing a specific routine or plug-in that answers the exact question, I just rely on the basic ideas and write variations of the code to handle all kinds of layout issues, not just text, including fitting divs, spans, images,... by width, height, area,... within a container, matching another element....Here's an example:I got the same problem and the solution is basically use javascript to control font-size. \nCheck this example on codepen: https://codepen.io/ThePostModernPlatonic/pen/BZKzVRThis is example is only for height, maybe you need to put some if's about the width.I did likeJust wanted to add my version for contenteditables.I have found a way to prevent the use of loops to shrink the text. It adjusts the font-size by multiplying it for the rate between container's width and content width. So if the container's width is 1/3 of the content, the font-size will be reduced by 1/3 and will container's width. To scale up, I have used a while loop, until content is bigger than container.This code is part of a test that I have uploaded to Github https://github.com/ricardobrg/fitText/I went with geekMonkey solution, but it's too slow. What he does, is he adjusts the font size to maximum (maxFontPixels) and then checks if it fits inside the container. else it reduces the font size by 1px and checks again. Why not simply check the previous container for the height and submit that value? (yes, I know why, but I now made a solution, that only works on the height and also has a min/max option)Here is a much quicker solution:and this would be the HTML:Again: this solution ONLY checks for the height of the container. That's why this function does not has to check, if the element fits inside. But I also implemented a min/max value (40min, 150max) so for me this works perfectly fine (and also works on window resize).This is the most elegant solution I have created. It uses binary search, doing  10 iterations. The naive way was to do a while loop and increase the font size by 1 until the element started to overflow. You can determine when an element begins to overflow using element.offsetHeight and element.scrollHeight. If scrollHeight is bigger than offsetHeight, you have a font size that is too big.Binary search is a much better algorithm for this. It also is limited by the number of iterations you want to perform. Simply call flexFont and insert the div id and it will adjust the font size between 8px and 96px.I have spent some time researching this topic and trying different libraries, but ultimately I think this is the easiest and most straightforward solution that will actually work.Note if you want you can change to use offsetWidth and scrollWidth, or add both to this function.Here is another version of this solution:"},

So for Android 4.4 and later the following is suggested as best practice:Since there is still no solution for initial issue, here's my pure CSS two cents.Mobile browsers (most of them) require font-size in inputs to be 16px. Sosolves the issue. So you don't need to disable zoom and loose accessibility features of you site.If your base font-size is not 16px or not 16px on mobiles, you can use media queries.please try adding this meta-tag and style Possible Solution for Web Apps: While zooming can not be disabled in iOS Safari anymore, it will be disabled when opening the site from a home screen shortcut.Add these meta tags to declare your App as \"Web App capable\":However only use this feature if your app is self sustaining, as the forward/backward buttons and URL bar aswell as the sharing options are disabled. (You can still swipe left and right though) This approach however enables quite the app like ux. The fullscreen browser only starts when the site is loaded from the homescreen. I also only got it to work after I included an apple-touch-icon-180x180.png in my root folder.As a bonus, you probably also want to include a variant of this aswell:You can accomplish the task by simply adding the following 'meta' element into your 'head':Adding all the attributes like 'width','initial-scale', 'maximum-width', 'maximum-scale' might not work. Therefore, just add the above element.Seems like just adding meta tags to index.html doesn't prevent page from zooming. Adding below style will do the magic.

I would also like to point out that this problem is a result of the w3c specification, not poor CSS3 support, so any solution will still be relevant and useful when CSS3 has more widespread support.I figured it out. You just have to use some special selectors.The problem with rounding the corners of the table was that the td elements didn't also become rounded. You can solve that by doing something like this:Now everything rounds properly, except that there's still the issue of border-collapse: collapse breaking everything. A workaround is to add border-spacing: 0 and leave the default border-collapse: separate on the table.The following method works (tested in Chrome) by using a box-shadow with a spread of 1px instead of a \"real\" border.If you want a CSS-only solution (no need to set cellspacing=0 in the HTML) that allows for 1px borders (which you can't do with the border-spacing: 0 solution), I prefer to do the following:See a demo here.Given the following HTML:SEE example below:\nHave you tried using table{border-spacing: 0} instead of table{border-collapse: collapse} ???You'll probably have to put another element around the table and style that with a rounded border.The working draft specifies that border-radius does not apply to table elements when the value of border-collapse is collapse.As Ian said, the solution is to nest the table inside a div and set it like that:With overflow:hidden, the square corners won't bleed through the div.To the best of my knowledge, the only way you could do it would be to modify all the cells like so:And then to get the border on the bottom and right back:last-child is not valid in ie6, but if you are using border-radius I assume you don't care.EDIT:After looking at your example page, it appears that you may be able to work around this with cell spacing and padding.  The thick gray borders you are seeing are actually the background of the table (you can see this clearly if you change the border color to red). If you set the cellspacing to zero (or equivalently: td, th { margin:0; }) the grey \"borders\" will disappear.EDIT 2:I can't find a way to do this with only one table. If you change your header row to a nested table, you might possibly be able to get the effect you want, but it'll be more work, and not dynamic.I tried a workaround using the pseudo elements :before and :after on the thead th:first-child and thead th:last-childIn combination with wrapping the table with a <div class=\"radius borderCCC\">see jsFiddleWorks for me in chrome (13.0.782.215) Let me know if this works for you in other browsers.Actually you can add your table inside a div as its wrapper. and then assign these CSS codes to wrapper:The given answers only work when there are no borders around the table, which is very limiting!I have a macro in SASS to do this, which fully supports external and internal borders, achieving the same styling as border-collapse: collapse without actually specifying it.

I gave the property display:inline-flex; to this ID as the ID wrapper is the flex container.But there is no difference in presentation. I expected that everything in the wrapper ID would be displayed inline. Why isn't it?JSFiddle Exampledisplay: inline-flex does not make flex items display inline. It makes the flex container display inline. That is the only difference between display: inline-flex and display: flex. A similar comparison can be made between display: inline-block and display: block, and pretty much any other display type that has an inline counterpart.1There is absolutely no difference in the effect on flex items; flex layout is identical whether the flex container is block-level or inline-level. In particular, the flex items themselves always behave like block-level boxes (although they do have some properties of inline-blocks). You cannot display flex items inline; otherwise you don't actually have a flex layout.It is not clear what exactly you mean by \"vertically align\" or why exactly you want to display the contents inline, but I suspect that flexbox is not the right tool for whatever you are trying to accomplish. Chances are what you're looking for is just plain old inline layout (display: inline and/or display: inline-block), for which flexbox is not a replacement; flexbox is not the universal layout solution that everyone claims it is (I'm stating this because the misconception is probably why you're considering flexbox in the first place).1 The differences between block layout and inline layout are outside the scope of this question, but the one that stands out the most is auto width: block-level boxes stretch horizontally to fill their containing block, whereas inline-level boxes shrink to fit their contents. In fact, it is for this reason alone you will almost never use display: inline-flex unless you have a very good reason to display your flex container inline.flex and inline-flex both apply flex layout to children of the container. Container with display:flex behaves like a block-level element itself, while display:inline-flex makes the container behaves like an inline element.OK, I know at first might be a bit confusing, but display is talking about the parent element, so means when we say: display: flex;, it's about the element and when we say display:inline-flex;, is also making the element itself inline...It's like make a div inline or block, run the snippet below and you can see how display flex breaks down to next line:Also quickly create the image below to show the difference at a glance:The Difference between \"flex\" and \"inline-flex\"Short answer: One is inline and the other basically responds like a block element(but has some of it's own differences).Longer answer:Inline-Flex - The inline version of flex allows the element, and it's children, to have flex properties while still remaining in the regular flow of the document/webpage. Basically, you can place two inline flex containers in the same row, if the widths were small enough, without any excess styling to allow them to exist in the same row. This is pretty similar to \"inline-block.\"Flex - The container and it's children have flex properties but the container reserves the row, as it is taken out of the normal flow of the document. It responds like a block element, in terms of document flow. Two flexbox containers could not exist on the same row without excess styling.The problem you may be havingDue to the elements you listed in your example, though I am guessing, I think you want to use flex to display the elements listed in an even row-by-row fashion but continue to see the elements side-by-side.The reason you are likely having issues is because flex and inline-flex have the default \"flex-direction\" property set to \"row.\" This will display the children side-by side. Changing this property to \"column\" will allow your elements to stack and reserve space(width) equal to the width of its parent.Below are some examples to show how flex vs inline-flex works and also a quick demo of how inline vs block elements work...FiddleFiddleFiddleFiddleFiddleFiddleAlso, a great reference doc:\nA Complete Guide to Flexbox - css tricksDisplay:flex apply flex layout to the flex items or children of the container only. So, the container itself stays a block level element and thus takes up the entire width of the screen.This causes every flex container to move to a new line on the screen.Display:inline-flex apply flex layout to the flex items or children as well as to the container itself. As a result the container behaves as an inline flex element just like the children do and thus takes up the width required by its items/children only and not the entire width of the screen.This causes two or more flex containers one after another, displayed as inline-flex, align themselves side by side on the screen until the whole width of the screen is taken.You need a bit more information so that the browser knows what you want. For instance, the children of the container need to be told \"how\" to flex.Updated FiddleI've added #wrapper > * { flex: 1; margin: auto; } to your CSS and changed inline-flex to flex, and you can see how the elements now space themselves out evenly on the page.Open in Full page for better understanding"},

You can't use text as a background image, but you can use the :before or :after pseudo classes to place a text character where you want it, without having to add all kinds of messy extra mark-up.Be sure to set position:relative on your actual text wrapper for the positioning to work.EDIT:Font Awesome v5 uses other font names than older versions:Note that you should set the same font-weight property, too (seems to be 900).Another way to find the font name is to right click on a sample font awesome icon on your page and get the font name (same way the utf-8 icon code can be found, but note that you can find it out on :before).Further to the answer from Diodeus above, you need the font-family: FontAwesome rule (assuming you have the @font-face rule for FontAwesome declared already in your CSS). Then it is a matter of knowing which CSS content value corresponds to which icon. I have listed them all here: http://astronautweb.co/snippet/font-awesome/Actually even font-awesome CSS has a similar strategy for setting their icon styles.  If you want to get a quick hold of the icon code, check the non-minified font-awesome.css file and there they are....each font in its purity.Consolidating everything above, the following is the final class which works wellYou can try this example class. and find icon content here: http://astronautweb.co/snippet/font-awesome/To use font awesome using css follow below steps - step 1 - Add Fonts of FontAwesome in CSSStep - 2 Use below css to apply font on class element of HTMLAnd finally, use \"sorting_asc\" class to apply the css on desired HTML tag/element.No need to embed content into the CSS.

So, first I need to search if such icon exists in fontawesome. Like in the case I found it here, i.e. fa fa-paperclip. Then I would right click the icon there, and go the ::before pseudo property to fetch out the content tag it is using, which in my case I found to be \\f0c6. Then I would use that in my css like this:Use the following Python program via command line to create png images from Font-Awesome icons:https://github.com/Pythonity/font-awesome-to-png"},

I cannot use the screen size as the div is just used like a widget within the webpage, and its size can vary.Looks like there is work being done on this now:\nhttps://github.com/ResponsiveImagesCG/cq-demosNo, media queries aren't designed to work based on elements in a page. They are designed to work based on devices or media types (hence why they are called media queries). width, height, and other dimension-based media features all refer to the dimensions of either the viewport or the device's screen in screen-based media. They cannot be used to refer to a certain element on a page.If you need to apply styles depending on the size of a certain div element on your page, you'll have to use JavaScript to observe changes in the size of that div element instead of media queries.I've just created a javascript shim to achieve this goal. Take a look if you want, it's a proof-of-concept, but take care: it's a early version and still needs some work.https://github.com/marcj/css-element-queriesA Media Query inside of an iframe can function as an element query. I've successfully implement this. The idea came from a recent post about Responsive Ads by Zurb. No Javascript!This is currently not possible with CSS alone as @BoltClock wrote in the accepted answer, but you can work around that by using JavaScript.I created a container query (aka element query) prolyfill to solve this kind of issue. It works a bit different than other scripts, so you don’t have to edit the HTML code of your elements. All you have to do is include the script and use it in your CSS like so:https://github.com/ausi/cq-prolyfillI ran into the same problem a couple of years ago and funded the development of a plugin to help me in my work. I've released the plugin as open-source so others can benefit from it as well, and you can grab it on Github: https://github.com/eqcss/eqcssThere are a few ways we could apply different responsive styles based on what we can know about an element on the page. Here are a few element queries that the EQCSS plugin will let you write in CSS:So what conditions are supported for responsive styles with EQCSS?Inside EQCSS element queries you can also use three special selectors that allow you to more specifically apply your styles:Element queries allow you to compose your layout out of individually responsive design modules, each with a bit of 'self-awareness' of how they are being displayed on the page.With EQCSS you can design one widget to look good from 150px wide all the way up to 1000px wide, then you can confidently drop that widget into any sidebar in any page using any template (on any site) and The question is very vague.  As BoltClock says, media queries only know the dimensions of the device.  However, you can use media queries in combination with descender selectors to perform adjustments.The only other solution requires JS.The only way I can think that you can accomplish what you want purely with css, is to use a fluid container for your widget. If your container's width is a percentage of the screen then you can use media queries to style depending on your container's width, as you will now know for each screen's dimensions what is your container's dimensions. For example, let's say you decide to make your container's 50% of the screen width. Then for a screen width of 1200px you know that your container is 600pxFrom a layout perspective, it is possible using modern techniques.Its made up (I believe) by Heydon Pickering. He details the process here: http://www.heydonworks.com/article/the-flexbox-holy-albatrossChris Coyier picks it up and works through a demo of it here: https://css-tricks.com/putting-the-flexbox-albatross-to-real-use/To restate the issue, below we see 3 of the same component, each made up of three orange divs labelled a, b and c.The second two's blocks display vertically, because they are limited on horizontal room, while the top components 3 blocks are laid out horizontally.It uses the flex-basis CSS property and CSS Variables to create this effect.DemoHeydon's article is 1000 words explaining it in detail, and I'd highly recommend reading it.I was also thinking of media queries, but then I found this:Just create a wrapper <div> with a percentage value for padding-bottom, like this:It will result in a <div> with height equal to 75% of the width of its container (a 4:3 aspect ratio).This technique can also be coupled with media queries and a bit of ad hoc knowledge about page layout for even more finer-grained control.It's enough for my needs. Which might be enough for your needs too.You can use the ResizeObserver API. It's still in it's early days so it's not supported by all browsers yet (but there several polyfills that can help you with that).Basically this API allow you to attach an event listener to the resize of a DOM element.Demo 1 - Demo 2For mine I did it by setting the div's max width, hence for small widget won't get affected and the large widget is resized due to the max-width style.

Rows and cols are required and useful if the client does not support CSS. But as a designer I overwrite them to get exactly the size I wish. The recommended way to do it is via an external stylesheet e.g.In HTML setIn CSS set This will trigger the browser to set the height of the textarea EXACTLY to the amount of rows plus the paddings around it. Setting the CSS height to an exact amount of pixels leaves arbitrary whitespaces.According to the w3c, cols and rows are both required attributes for textareas.  Rows and Cols are the number of characters that are going to fit in the textarea rather than pixels or some other potentially arbitrary value.  Go with the rows/cols.The answer is \"yes\". That is, you should use both. Without rows and cols (and there are default values even if you don't use them explicitly) the textarea is unusably small if CSS is disabled or overriden by a user stylesheet. Always keep accessibility concerns in mind. That being said, if your stylesheet is allowed to control the appearance of the textarea, you will generally wind up with something that looks a whole lot better, fits into the overall page design well, and that can resize to keep up with user input (within the limits of good taste, of course).For text area we can use below css to fix size Tested in angularjs and angular7The size of a textarea can be specified by the cols and rows attributes, or even better; through CSS' height and width properties.\nThe cols attribute is supported in all major browsers.\nOne main difference is that <TEXTAREA ...> is a container tag: it has a start tag (). I usually don't specify height, but do specify width: ... and rows and cols.Usually, in my cases, only width and rows are needed, for the textarea to look nice in relation to other elems. (And cols is a fallback if someone doesn't use CSS, as explained in the other answers.)((Specifying both rows and height feels a little bit like duplicating data I think?))A major feature of textareas is that they are expandable. On a web page this can result in scroll bars appearing on the text area if the text length overfills the space you set (be that using rows, or be that using CSS. That can be a problem when a user decides to print, particularly with 'printing' to PDF - so set a comfortably large min-height for printed textareas with a conditional CSS rule:if you dont use  every time use  line-height:'..'; property its control the height of textarea and width property for width of textarea.or you can make use of  font-size by following css:HTML rows and cols are not responsive! So I define the size in CSS. As a tip: if you define a small size for mobiles think about using textarea:focus {};Add some extra space here, which will only unfold the moment a user wants to actually write something"},

This was deliberate (since I consider that better for longer texts), but because it's different from what text-overflow: ellipsis does, I thought I should mention it.If you can live with these caveats, the HTML looks like this:And this is the corresponding CSS, using the example of a 150 pixel wide box with three lines of text on a white background.

Rather than trying to insert your own ellipsis through css trickery or js I thought i'd try and roll with the single line only restriction. So I duplicate the text for every \"line\" and just use a negative text-indent to make sure one line starts where the last one stops. FIDDLECSS:HTML:More details in the fiddle.

For example say we want to design a basic website which has a layout like below...Live Example of the demo image.Code For DemoNote: You might have to add header, footer, aside, section (and other HTML5 elements) as display: block; in your stylesheet for explicitly mentioning that the elements are block level elements.I have a basic layout, 1 header, 1 side bar, 1 content area and 1 footer.No floats for header, next comes the aside tag which I'll be using for my website sidebar, so I'll be floating the element to left.So as you note, the left floated div leaves the space to its right unused, which will allow the div after it to shift in the remaining space.Ok, so this is how block level elements behave when floated left or right, so now why is clear: both; required and why?So if you note in the layout demo - in case you forgot, here it is..I am using a class called .clear and it holds a property called clear with a value of both. So lets see why it needs both.I've floated aside and section elements to the left, so assume a scenario, where we have a pool, where header is solid land, aside and section are floating in the pool and footer is solid land again, something like this..So the blue water has no idea what the area of the floated elements are, they can be bigger than the pool or smaller, so here comes a common issue which troubles 90% of CSS beginners: why the background of a container element is not stretched when it holds floated elements.  It's because the container element is a POOL here and the POOL has no idea how many objects are floating, or what the length or breadth of the floated elements are, so it simply won't stretch.(Refer [Clearfix] section of this answer for neat way to do this. I am using an empty div example intentionally for explanation purpose)I've provided 3 examples above, 1st is the normal document flow where red background will just render as expected since the container doesn't hold any floated objects.In the second example, when the object is floated to left, the container element (POOL) won't know the dimensions of the floated elements and hence it won't stretch to the floated elements height.After using clear: both;, the container element will be stretched to its floated element dimensions.Another reason the clear: both; is used is to prevent the element to shift up in the remaining space.Say you want 2 elements side by side and another element below them... So you will float 2 elements to left and you want the other below them.Last but not the least, the footer tag will be rendered after floated elements as I've used the clear class before declaring my footer tags, which ensures that all the floated elements (left/right) are cleared up to that point.Coming to clearfix which is related to floats. As already specified by @Elky, the way we are clearing these floats is not a clean way to do it as we are using an empty div element which is not a div element is meant for. Hence here comes the clearfix.Think of it as a virtual element which will create an empty element for you before your parent element ends. This will self clear your wrapper element holding floated elements. This element won't exist in your DOM literally but will do the job.To self clear any wrapper element having floated elements, we can useNote the :after pseudo element used by me for that class. That will create a virtual element for the wrapper element just before it closes itself. If we look in the dom you can see how it shows up in the Document tree.So if you see, it is rendered after the floated child div where we clear the floats which is nothing but equivalent to have an empty div element with clear: both; property which we are using for this too. Now why display: table; and content is out of this answers scope but you can learn more about pseudo element here.Note that this will also work in IE8 as IE8 supports :after pseudo.Most of the developers float their content left or right on their pages, probably divs holding logo, sidebar, content etc., these divs are floated left or right, leaving the rest of the space unused and hence if you place other containers, it will float too in the remaining space, so in order to prevent that clear: both; is used, it clears all the elements floated left or right.Now what if you want to make the other div render below div1, so you'll use clear: both; so it will ensure you clear all floats, left or rightThe clear property indicates that the left, right or both sides of an element can not be adjacent to earlier floated elements within the same block formatting context. Cleared elements are pushed below the corresponding floated elements. Examples:CSS float and clearSample FiddleJust try to remove clear:both property from the div with class sample and see how it follows floating divs.Mr. Alien's answer is perfect, but anyway I don't recommend to use <div class=\"clear\"></div> because it just a hack which makes your markup dirty. This is useless empty div in terms of bad structure and semantic, this also makes your code not flexible. In some browsers this div causes additional height and you have to add height: 0; which even worse. But real troubles begin when you want to add background or border around your floated elements - it just will collapse because web was designed badly. I do recommend to wrap floated elements into container which has clearfix CSS rule. This is hack as well, but beautiful, more flexible to use and readable for human and SEO robots.  When you want one element placed at the bottom other element you use this code in CSS.\nIt is used for floats.If you float content you can float left or right... so in a common layout you might have a left nav, a content div and a footer.To ensure the footer stays below both of these floats (if you have floated left and right) then you put the footer as clear: both.This way it will stay below both floats.(If you are only clearing left then you only really need to clear: left;.)Go through this tutorial:"},

HTML5 allows anchor elements to wrap almost anything, so in that case the div element can be made a child of the anchor. Otherwise the principle is the same - use the :hover pseudo-class to change the display property of another element. jsfiddleSince this answer is popular I think a small explanation is needed. Using this method when you hover on the internal element, it wont disappear.\nBecause the .showme is inside .showhim it will not disappear when you move your mouse between the two lines of text (or whatever it is). These are example of quirqs you need to take care of when implementing such behavior.It all depends what you need this for. This method is better for a menu style scenario, while Yi Jiang's is better for tooltips.I found using opacity is better, it allows you to add css3 transitions to make a nice finished hover effect. The transitions will just be dropped by older IE browsers, so it degrades gracefully to.I'm by know means an expert, but I'm incredibly proud of myself for having worked something out about this code. If you do:(Note the '>') You can contain the whole thing in an a tag, then, as long as your trigger (which can be in it's own div, or straight up in the a tag, or anything you want) is physically touching the revealed div, you can move your mouse from one to the other.Maybe this isn't useful for a great deal, but I had to set my revealed div to overflow: auto, so sometimes it had scroll bars, which couldn't be used as soon as you move away from the div.In fact, after finally working out how to make the revealed div, (although it is now a child of the trigger, not a sibling), sit behind the trigger, in terms of z-index, (with a little help from this page: How to get a parent element to appear above child) you don't even have to roll over the revealed div to scroll it, just stay hovering over the trigger and use your wheel, or whatever.My revealed div covers most of the page, so this technique makes it a lot more permanent, rather than the screen flashing from one state to another with every move of the mouse. It's really intuitive actually, hence why I'm really quite proud of myself.The only downside is that you can't put links within the whole thing, but you can use the whole thing as one big link.This answer doesn't require that you know the what type of display (inline, etc.) the hideable element is supposed to be when being shown:This uses the adjacent sibling selector and the not selector. I would like to offer this general purpose template solution that expands on the correct solution provided by Yi Jiang's.The additional benefits include:In the html you place the following structure:In the css you place the following structure:As additional information.  When the popup contains information that you might want to cut and paste or contains an object that you might want to interact with then first replace:withAnd second, adjust the position of div.popup so that there is an overlap with div.information.  A few pixels is sufficient to ensure that the div.popup is can receive the hover when moving the cusor off div.information.This does not work as expected with Internet Explorer 10.0.9200 and does work as expected with Opera 12.16, Firefox 18.0 and Google Chrome 28.0.15.See fiddle http://jsfiddle.net/F68Le/ for a complete example with a popup multilevel menu.please test this codeThe + allow 'select' only first not nested element , the > select nested elements only - the better is to use ~ which allow to select arbitrary element which is child of parent hovered element.

", "url": "[Is CSS Turing complete?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2497146/is-css-turing-complete)", "vote": 292, "content": "CSS isn't, insofar as I know, Turing complete.  But my knowledge of CSS is very limited.  You can encode Rule 110 in CSS3, so it's Turing-complete so long as you consider an appropriate accompanying HTML file and user interactions to be part of the “execution” of CSS. A pretty good implementation is available, and another implementation is included here:One aspect of Turing completeness is that its halting problem is undecidable.This means there's no general algorithm for determining whether a CSS program will finish running or loop forever.But we can derive such an algorithm for CSS! Here it is:That's it. Since we just showed that the halting problem is decidable for CSS, it follows that CSS is not Turing complete.(Other people have mentioned IE 6, which allows for embedding arbitrary JavaScript expressions in CSS; that will obviously add Turing completeness. But that feature is non-standard, and nobody in their right mind uses it anyway.)Daniel Wagner brought up a point that I missed in the original answer. He notes that while I've covered animations, other parts of the style engine such as selector matching or layout can lead to Turing completeness as well. While it's difficult to make a formal argument about these, I'll try to outline why Turing completeness is still unlikely to happen.First: Turing complete languages have some way of feeding data back into itself, whether it be through recursion or looping. But the design of the CSS language is hostile to this feedback:That should be enough to convince you that selector matching, on its own, cannot be Turing complete. But what about layout?The modern CSS layout algorithm is very complex, with features such as Flexbox and Grid muddying the waters. But even if it were possible to trigger an infinite loop with layout, it would be hard to leverage this to perform useful computation. That's because CSS selectors inspect only the internal structure of the DOM, not how these elements are laid out on the screen. So any Turing completeness proof using the layout system must depend on layout alone.Finally – and this is perhaps the most important reason – browser vendors have an interest in keeping CSS not Turing complete. By restricting the language, vendors allow for clever optimizations that make the web faster for everyone. Moreover, Google dedicates a whole server farm to searching for bugs in Chrome. If there were a way to write an infinite loop using CSS, then they probably would have found it already 😉As per this article, it's not. The article also argues that it's not a good idea to make it one.To quote from one of the comments:Turing-completeness is not only about \"defining functions\" or \"have ifs/loops/etc\". For example, Haskell doesn't have \"loop\", lambda-calculus don't have \"ifs\", etc...For example, this site: http://experthuman.com/programming-with-nothing. The author uses Ruby and create a \"FizzBuzz\" program with only closures (no strings, numbers, or anything like that)...There are examples when people compute some arithmetical functions on Scala using only the type systemSo, yes, in my opinion, CSS3+HTML is turing-complete (even if you can't exactly do any real computation with then without becoming crazy) The fundamental issue here is that any machine written in HTML+CSS cannot evaluate infinitely many steps (i.e there can be no \"real\" recursion) unless the code is infinitely long. And the question will this machine reach configuration H in n steps or less is always answerable if n is finite.This answer is not accurate because it mix description of UTM and UTM itself (Universal Turing Machine).We have good answer but from different perspective and it do not show directly flaws in current top answer.First of all we can agree that human can work as UTM. This mean if we doThen CSS part is useless because all work can be done by Human who will do UTM part. Act of clicking can be UTM, because you do not click at random but only in specific places.Instead of CSS I could use this text (Rule 110):To guide my actions and result will be same. This mean this text UTM? No this is only input (description) that other UTM (human or computer) can read and run. Clicking is enough to run any UTM.Critical part that CSS lack is ability to change of it own state in arbitrary way, if CSS could generate clicks then it would be UTM. Argument that your clicks are \"crank\" for CSS is not accurate because real \"crank\" for CSS is Layout Engine that run it and it should be enough to prove that CSS is UTM.CSS is not a programming language, so the question of turing-completeness is a meaningless one. If programming extensions are added to CSS such as was the case in IE6 then that new synthesis is a whole different thing.CSS is merely a description of styles; it does not have any logic, and its structure is flat."},

My problem is that I can't get the footer to stay at the bottom of the page in all browsers.  It works if the content pushes the footer down, but that's not always the case. To get a sticky footer:Probably the most obvious and non-hacky way to go about a sticky footer would be to make use of the new css viewport units.Take for example the following simple markup:If the header is say 80px high and the footer is 40px high, then we can make our sticky footer with one single rule on the content div:Which means: let the height of the content div be at least 100% of the viewport height minus the combined heights of the header and footer.That's it.... and here's how the same code works with lots of content in the content div:NB:1) The height of the header and footer must be known2) Old versions of IE (IE8-) and Android (4.4-) don't support viewport units. (caniuse)3) Once upon a time webkit had a problem with viewport units within a calc rule. This has indeed been fixed (see here) so there's no problem there. However if you're looking to avoid using calc for some reason you can get around that using negative margins and padding with box-sizing -Like so:Solution inspired by Philip Walton's sticky footer. This solution is valid only for:It is based on the flex display, leveraging the flex-grow property, which allows an element to grow in either height or width (when the flow-direction is set to either column or row respectively), to occupy the extra space in the container.We are going to leverage also the vh unit, where 1vh is defined as: Therefore a height of 100vh it's a concise way to tell an element to span the full viewport's height.This is how you would structure your web page:In order to have the footer stick to the bottom of the page, you want the space between the body and the footer to grow as much as it takes to push the footer at the bottom of the page.Therefore our layout becomes:You can play with it at the JSFiddle.Be aware that Safari has a flawed implementation of the flex-shrink property, which allows items to shrink more than the minimum height that would be required to display the content.\nTo fix this issue you will have to set the flex-shrink property explicitly to 0 to the .content and the footer in the above example:You could use position: absolute following to put the footer at the bottom of the page, but then make sure your 2 columns have the appropriate margin-bottom so that they never get occluded by the footer.Here is a solution with jQuery that works like a charm. It checks if the height of the window is greater than the height of the body. If it is, then it changes the margin-top of the footer to compensate. Tested in Firefox, Chrome, Safari and Opera.If your footer already has a margin-top (of 50 pixels, for example) you will need to change the last part for:Set the CSS for the #footer to:You will then need to add a padding or margin to the bottom of your #sidebar and #content to match the height of #footer or when they overlap, the #footer will cover them.Also, if I remember correctly, IE6 has a problem with the bottom: 0 CSS. You might have to use a JS solution for IE6 (if you care about IE6 that is).A similar solution to @gcedo but without the need of adding an intermediate content in order to push the footer down. We can simply add margin-top:auto to the footer and it will be pushed to the bottom of the page regardless his height or the height of the content above.I have myself struggled with this sometimes and I always found that the solution with all those div's within each other was a messy solution. \nI just messed around with it a bit, and I personally found out that this works and it certainly is one of the simplest ways:What I like about this is that no extra HTML needs to be applied. You can simply add this CSS and then write your HTML as wheneverSince the Grid solution hasn't been presented yet, here it is, with just two declarations for the parent element, if we take the height: 100% and margin: 0 for granted:CSS :HTML:This should do the trick if you are looking for a responsive footer aligned at the bottom of the page,which always keeps a top-margin of 80% of the viewport height.Use absolute positioning and z-index to create a sticky footer div at any resolution using the following steps: Here is an example:For this question many of the answers I have seen are clunky, hard to implement and inefficient so I thought I'd take a shot at it and come up with my own solution which is just a tiny bit of css and htmlthis works by setting the height of the footer and then using css calc to work out the minimum height the page can be with the footer still at the bottom, hope this helps some people :)index.html:main.css:Source: https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-keep-your-footer-where-it-belongs-59c6aa05c59c/One solution would be to set the min-height for the boxes. Unfortunately it seems that it's not well supported by IE (surprise).None of these pure css solutions work properly with dynamically resizing content (at least on firefox and Safari) e.g., if you have a background set on the container div, the page and then resize (adding a few rows) table inside the div, the table can stick out of the bottom of the styled area, i.e., you can have half the table in white on black theme and half the table complete white because both the font-color and background color is white. It's basically unfixable with themeroller pages.Nested div multi-column layout is an ugly hack and the 100% min-height body/container div for sticking footer is an uglier hack.The only none-script solution that works on all the browsers I've tried: a much simpler/shorter table with thead (for header)/tfoot (for footer)/tbody (td's for any number of columns) and 100% height. But this have perceived semantic and SEO disadvantages (tfoot must appear before tbody. ARIA roles may help decent search engines though).Multiple people have put the answer to this simple problem up here, but I have one thing to add, considering how frustrated I was until I figured out what I was doing wrong.As mentioned the most straightforward way to do this is like so..However the property not mentioned in posts, presumably because it is usually default, is the position: static on the body tag. Position relative will not work!My wordpress theme had overridden the default body display and it confused me for an obnoxiously long time.An old thread I know, but if you are looking for a responsive solution, this jQuery addition will help: Full guide can be found here: https://pixeldesigns.co.uk/blog/responsive-jquery-sticky-footer/I have created a very simple library https://github.com/ravinderpayal/FooterJS It is very simple in use. After including library, just call this line of code. Footers can be dynamically changed by recalling above function with different parameter/id. Note:- You haven't to alter or add any CSS. Library is dynamic which implies that even if screen is resized after loading page it will reset the position of footer. I have created this library, because CSS solves the problem for a while but when size of display changes significantly,from desktop to tablet or vice versa, they either overlap the content or they no longer remains sticky.Another solution is CSS Media Queries, but you have to manually write different CSS styles for different size of screens while this library does its work automatically and is supported by all basic JavaScript supporting browser.Edit\nCSS solution:Now, if the height of display is more than your content length, we will make footer fixed to bottom and if not, it will automatically appear in very end of display as you need to scroll to view this.And, it seems a better solution than JavaScript/library one.I wasn't having any luck with the solutions suggested on this page before but then finally, this little trick worked. I'll include it as another possible solution.Flex layout is preferred for natural header and footer heights. This flex solution is tested in modern browsers and actually works :) in IE11.See JS Fiddle.HTMLCSSFor me the nicest way of displaying it (the footer) is sticking to the bottom but not covering content all the time:jQuery CROSS BROWSER CUSTOM PLUGIN - $.footerBottom()Or use jQuery like I do, and set your footer height to auto or to fix, whatever you like, it will work anyway. this plugin uses jQuery selectors so to make it work, you will have to include the jQuery library to your file.Here is how you run the plugin. Import jQuery, copy the code of this custom jQuery plugin and import it after importing jQuery! It is very simple and basic, but important. When you do it, all you have to do is run this code:there is no need to place it inside the document ready event. It will run well as it is. It will recalculate the position of your footer when the page is loaded and when the window get resized.Here is the code of the plugin which you do not have to understand. Just know how to implement it. It does the job for you. However, if you like to know how it works, just look through the code. I left comments for you.The flex solutions worked for me as far as making the footer sticky, but unfortunately changing the body to use flex layout made some of our page layouts change, and not for the better. What finally worked for me was:I got this from ctf0's response at https://css-tricks.com/couple-takes-sticky-footer/If you don't want it using position fixed, and following you annoyingly on mobile, this seems to be working for me so far.Just set the html to min-height: 100%; and position: relative;, then position: absolute; bottom: 0; left: 0; on the footer. I then made sure the footer was the last element in the body.Let me know if this doesn't work for anyone else, and why. I know these tedious style hacks can behave strangely among various circumstances I'd not thought of.The trick is to fix the position of the footer while setting the bottom to 0. The simplest solution would be: See here this full simple example :  Try putting a container div (with overflow:auto) around the content and sidebar.If that doesn't work, do you have any screenshots or example links where the footer isn't displayed properly?"},

I can't correctly determine the phone's screen width, so the only way I can think of doing this is to add background images of a div and use @media to determine the screen width and display the correct image.For example:Is this possible, or does anyone have any other suggestions?No, @media rules and media queries cannot exist in inline style attributes as they can only contain property: value declarations. As the spec puts it:The only way to apply styles to an element only in certain media is with a separate rule in your stylesheet, which means you'll need to come up with a selector for it.A dummy span selector would look like this, but if you're targeting a very specific element you will need a more specific selector:ProblemNo, Media Queries cannot be used in this way SolutionBut if you want provided a specific behavior usable on the fly AND responsive, you can use the style markup and not the attribute.e.i.See the code working in live on CodePenIn my Blog for example, I inject a <style> markup in <head> just after <link> declaration for CSS and it's contain the content of a textarea provided beside of real content textarea for create extra-class on the fly when I wrote an artitle.Note : the scoped attribute is a part of HTML5 specification. If you do not use it, the validator will blame you but browsers currently not support the real purpose : scoped the content of <style> only on immediatly parent element and that element's child elements. Scoped is not mandatory if the <style> element is in <head> markup.UPDATE: I advice to always use rules in the mobile first way so previous code should be:Inline styles cannot currently contain anything other than declarations (property: value pairs).You can use style elements with appropriate media attributes in head section of your document.Yes, you can write media query in inline-css if you are using a picture tag. For different device sizes you can get different images.If you are using Bootstrap Responsive Utilities or similar alternative that allows to hide / show divs depending on the break points, it may be possible to use several elements and show the most appropriate. i.e.I tried to test this and it did not seem to work but I'm curious why Apple is using it.  I was just on https://linkmaker.itunes.apple.com/us/ and noticed in the generated code it provides if you select the 'Large Button' radio button, they are using an inline media query.note: added line-breaks for readability, original generated code is minifiedMedia Queries in style-Attributes are not possible right now.\nBut if you have to set this dynamically via Javascript.\nYou could insert that rule via JS aswell.This is as if the style was there in the stylesheet. So be aware of specificity.Hey I just wrote it.Now you can use <div style=\"color: red; @media (max-width: 200px) { color: green }\"> or so.Enjoy.You can use image-set()Inline media queries are possible by using something like Breakpoint for SassThis blog post does a good job explaining how inline media queries are more manageable than separate blocks: There Is No BreakpointRelated to inline media queries is the idea of \"element queries\", a few interesting reads are:yes,you can do with javascript by the  window.matchMediaif you add the rule to the print.css file you don't have to use @media.I uncluded it in the smarty foreach i use to give some elements a background color."},

Anyway, there still doesn't appear to be a general solution to this problem but some of the solutions posted here and in the linked question may work for specific cases.Set the parent div to position: relative, then the inner div to... ...and there you go :)A way to make it work is the following:After struggling with various techniques for a couple of days I have to say that this appears to be impossible. Even using javascript (which I don't want to do) it doesn't seem possible.To clarify for those who may not have understood - this is what I am looking for: in publishing it is quite common to layout an inset (picture, table, figure, etc.) so that its bottom lines up with the bottom of the last line of text of a block (or page) with text flowing around the inset in a natural manner above and to the right or left depending on which side of the page the inset is on. In html/css it is trivial to use the float style to line up the top of an inset with the top of a block but to my surprise it appears impossible to line up the bottom of the text and inset despite it being a common layout task.I guess I'll have to revisit the design goals for this item unless anyone has a last minute suggestion.I have acheived this in JQuery  by putting  a zero width strut element above the float right, then sizing the strut (or pipe) according to parent height minus floated child's height.Before js kicks in I am using the position absolute approach, which works but allows text flow behind.  Therefore I switch to position static to enable the strut approach.\n(header is the parent element, cutout is the one i want bottom right, and pipe is my strut)CSSThe pipe must come 1st, then the cutout, then the text in the HTML order.This puts a fixed div at the bottom of the page and fixes to the bottom as you scroll downPut the div in another div and set the parent div's style to position:relative; Then on the child div set the following CSS properties: position:absolute; bottom:0;If you're okay with only the bottom-most line of the text going to the side of the block (as opposed to completely around and underneath it, which you can't do without ending the block and starting a new one), it's not impossible to float a block to one of the bottom corners of a parent block. If you put some content in a paragraph tag within a block and want to float a link to the bottom right corner of the block, put the link within the paragraph block and set it to float: right, then put in a div tag with clear: both set just underneath the end of the paragraph tag. The last div is to make sure the parent tag surrounds the floated tags.If you want the text to wrap nicely:-I know that this stuff is old, but I recently ran into this problem. use absolute position divs advice is really silly, because the whole float thing kind of loses point with absolute positions.. now, I did not find an universal solution, but in a lot of cases prople use floating divs just to display something in a row, like a series of span elements. and you can't vertically align that. to achieve a similar effect you can do this: do not make the div float, but set it's display property to inline-block. then you can align it vertically however it pleases you. you just need to set parent's div property vertical-align to either top, bottom, middle or baselinei hope that helps someoneIf you set the parent element as position:relative, you can set the child to the bottom setting position:absolute; and bottom:0;With the introduction of Flexbox, this has become quite easy without much hacking. align-self: flex-end on the child element will align it along the cross-axis.Output:I would just do a table.And the CSS:See it in action:\nhttp://jsfiddle.net/mLphM/1/I tried several of these techniques, and the following worked for me, so if all else here if all else fails then try this because it worked for me :). A chose this approach of @dave-kok. But it works only if the whole content suits without scrolling. I appreciate if somebody will improveHere is code  http://jsfiddle.net/d9t9joh2/This is now possible with flex box.\nJust set the 'display' of parent div as 'flex' and set the 'margin-top' property to 'auto'.\nThis does not distort any property of both the div.Not sure, but a scenario posted earlier seemed to work if you use position: relative instead of absolute on the child div.And no tables...!I had been find this solution for a long time as well.\nThis is what I get:align-self: flex-end;link: https://philipwalton.github.io/solved-by-flexbox/demos/vertical-centering/\nHowever, I can't remember from where I opened this link. Hope it helpsIf you need relative alignment and DIV's still aren't give you what you want, just use tables and set valign = \"bottom\" in the cell you want the content aligned to the bottom.  I know it's not a great answer to your question since DIV's are supposed to replace tables, but this is what I had to do recently with an image caption and it has worked flawlessly so far.I tried this scenario posted earlier also;The absolute positioning fixes the div to the lowest part of the browser upon loading the page, but when you scroll down if the page is longer it does not scroll with you. I changed the positioning to be relative and it works perfect. The div goes straight to the bottom upon load so you won't actually see it until you get to the bottom.One interesting approach is to stack a couple of right float elements on top of each other.Only problem is that this only works when you know the height of the box.Stu's answer comes the closest to working so far, but it still doesn't take into account the fact that your outer div's height may change, based on the way the text wraps inside of it. So, repositioning the inner div (by changing the height of the \"pipe\") only once won't be enough. That change has to occur inside of a loop, so you can continually check whether you've achieved the right positioning yet, and readjust if needed.The CSS from the previous answer is still perfectly valid:However, the Javascript should look more like this:I know it is a very old thread but still I would like to answer. If anyone follow the below css & html then it works. The child footer div will stick with bottom like glue.To use css margin-top property with purpose to set footer to the bottom of its container. And to use css  text-align-last property to set the footer contents at center.Pretty old question, but still ...\nYou can float a div to the bottom of the page like this:You can see where the magic happens. I think you could do the same for floating it to the bottom of a parent div.simple......in the html file right....have the \"footer\" (or the div you want at the bottom) at the bottom. So dont do this:DO THIS: (have the footer underneath.)After doing this then you can go the css file and have the \"sidebar\" float to the left. then have \"content\" float to the right then have \"footer\" clear both.that should work.did for me.I got this to work on the first try by adding position:absolute; bottom:0; to the div ID inside the CSS. I did not add the parent style position:relative;.It is working perfect in both Firefox and IE 8, have not tried it in IE 7 yet. an alternative answer is the judicious use of tables and rowspan. by setting all table cells on the preceeding line (except the main content one) to be rowspan=\"2\" you will always get a one cell hole at the bottom of your main table cell that you can always put valign=\"bottom\".You can also set its height to be the minimum you need for one line. Thus you will always get your favourite line of text at the bottom regardless of how much space the rest of the text takes up.I tried all the div answers, I was unable to get them to do what I needed.here is my solution:You could try using an empty element with a 1px width and floating it. Then clear the element you actually want to position and use the height of the empty element to control how far down it goes. http://codepen.io/cssgrid/pen/KNYrey/To put any element at the bottom of its container, just used this:"},

Any idea how to remove that, so that the button works as a link even when clicked?The code of the accepted answer works for most cases, but to get a button that really behaves like a link you need a bit more code. It is especially tricky to get the styling of focused buttons right on Firefox (Mozilla).The following CSS ensures that anchors and buttons have the same CSS properties and behave the same on all common browsers:The example above only modifies button elements to improve readability, but it can easily be extended to modify input[type=\"button\"], input[type=\"submit\"] and input[type=\"reset\"] elements as well. You could also use a class, if you want to make only certain buttons look like anchors.See this JSFiddle for a live-demo.Please also note that this applies the default anchor-styling to buttons (e.g. blue text-color). So if you want to change the text-color or anything else of anchors & buttons, you should do this after the CSS above.The original code (see snippet) in this answer was completely different and incomplete.If you don't mind using twitter bootstrap I suggest you simply use the link class.I hope this helps somebody :) Have a nice day!try using the css pseudoclass :focusedit as for links and onclick events use (you shouldn’t use inline javascript eventhandlers, but for the sake of simplicity i will use them here):with this.href you can even access the target of the link in your function. return false will just prevent browsers from following the link when clicked.if javascript is disabled the link will work as a normal link and just load some/page.php—if you want your link to be dead when js is disabled use href=\"#\"You can't style buttons as links reliably throughout browsers.

Like here:I usually just float the first to the left, the second to the right. The third automatically aligns between them then.the advantage of this way is you can set each column width independant of the other as long as you keep it under 100%, if you use 3 x 30% the remaining 10% is split as a 5% divider space between the collumnsyou can float: left for all of them and set the width to 33.333%try to add \"display: block\" to the styleI didn't see the bootstrap answer, so for what's it's worth:let Bootstrap figure out the percentages.\nI like to clear both, just in case.I prefer this method, floats are poorly supported in older versions of IE (really?...)UPDATED :\nOf course, to use this technique and due to the absolute positioning you need to enclose the divs on a container and do a postprocessing to define the height of if, something like this: Not the most amazing thing in the world, but at least doesn't break on older IEs.

Works in Chrome 41,Firefox 37, IE 11Click for JS FiddleHere's how I managed to do something similar to this inside a <footer> element:CSS:@Leniel this method is good but you need to add width to all the floating div's. I would say make them equal width or assign fixed width. Something likeyou may assign class names to each div rather than adding inline style, which is not a good practice.Be sure to use a clearfix div or clear div to avoid following content remains below these div's.

For \"normal\" blocks,A way to solve the problem is forcing some in-flow element to be placed below all floats. Then, the height of the parent will grow to wrap that element (and thus the floats too).This can be achieved using the clear property:So a solution is adding an empty element with clear: both as the last sibling of the floatsHowever, that is not semantic. So better generate a pseudo-element at the end of the parent:There are multiple variants of this approach, e.g. using the deprecated single colon syntax :after to support old browsers, or using other block-level displays like display: table.There is an exception to the problematic behavior defined at the beginning: if a block element establishes a Block Formatting Context (is a BFC root), then it will also wrap its floating contents.According to 10.6.7 'Auto' heights for block formatting context roots,Additionally, as explained 9.5 Floats, BFC roots are also useful because of the following:A block formatting context is established byNote those may have undesired collateral effects, like clipping overflowing content, calculating auto widths with the shrink-to-fit algorithm, or becoming out-of-flow. So the problem is that it's not possible to have an in-flow block-level element with visible overflow that establishes a BFC.Display L3 addresses these issues:Sadly, there is no browser support yet. Eventually we may be able to usePut your floating div(s) in a div and in CSS give it overflow:hidden;\nit will work fine.W3Schools recommendation:put overflow: auto on parent element and it will \"color\" whole background including elements margins. Also floating elements will stay inside of border.http://www.w3schools.com/css/tryit.asp?filename=trycss_layout_clearfixThere's nothing missing. Float was designed for the case where you want an image (for example) to sit beside several paragraphs of text, so the text flows around the image. That wouldn't happen if the text \"stretched\" the container. Your first paragraph would end, and then your next paragraph would begin under the image (possibly several hundred pixels below).And that's why you're getting the result you are.In some cases, i.e. when (if) you're just using float to have elements flow on the same \"line\", you might use instead ofOtherwise, using a clear element at the end works, even if it may go against the grain to need an element to do what should be CSS work.Here's more modern approach: No more clearfixes. p.s. Using overflow: hidden; hides the box-shadow so... Thank you LSerni you solved it for me.To achieve this :You have to do this :As Lucas says, what you are describing is the intended behaviour for the float property. What confuses many people is that float has been pushed well beyond its original intended usage in order to make up for shortcomings in the CSS layout model.Have a look at Floatutorial if you'd like to get a better understanding of how this property works."},

You can fudge it with absolute positioning and strange margins, but it's just not a robust solution. The best option in your case would be to turn to javascript. In jQuery, this is a very simple task:or more generically:This can be done using Flexbox. Create a container that applies both display:flex and flex-flow:column-reverse.Sources:There is absolutely no way to achieve what you want through CSS alone while supporting pre-flexbox user agents (mostly old IE) -- unless:If the above are true then you can do what you want by absolutely positioning the elements --Again, if you don't know the height want for at least #firstDiv, there's no way you can do  what you want via CSS alone.  If any of this content is dynamic, you will have to use javascript.Here's a solution:But I suspect you have some content that follows the wrapper div...With CSS3 flexbox layout module, you can order divs.If you know, or can enforce the size for the to-be-upper element, you could use In your css and give the divs their position.otherwise javascript seems the only way to go:or something similar.edit: I just found this which might be useful: w3 document css3 move-toNegative top margins can achieve this effect, but they would need to be customized for each page.  For instance, this markup......and this CSS......would allow you to pull the second paragraph above the first.Of course, you'll have to manually tweak your CSS for different description lengths so that the intro paragraph jumps up the appropriate amount, but if you have limited control over the other parts and full control over markup and CSS then this might be an option.Well, with a bit of absolute positioning and some dodgy margin setting, I can get close, but it's not perfect or pretty:The \"margin-top: 4em\" is the particularly nasty bit: this margin needs to be adjusted according to the amount of content in the firstDiv. Depending on your exact requirements, this might be possible, but I'm hoping anyway that someone might be able to build on this for a solid solution.Eric's comment about JavaScript should probably be pursued.This can be done with CSS only! Please check my answer to this similar question:https://stackoverflow.com/a/25462829/1077230I don't want to double post my answer but the short of it is that the parent needs to become a flexbox element. Eg: (only using the webkit vendor prefix here.)Then, swap divs around by indicating their order with:In your CSS, float the first div by left or right. Float the second div by left or right same as first. Apply clear: left or right the same as the above two divs for the second div.For example:I was looking for a way to change the orders of the divs only for mobile version so then I can style it nicely. Thanks to nickf reply I got to make this piece of code which worked well for what I wanted, so i though of sharing it with you guys:A solution with a bigger browser support then the flexbox (works in IE≥9):In contrast to the display: table; solution this solution works when .wrapper has any amount of children.Just use flex for the parent div by specifying display: flex and flex-direction : column.\nThen use order to determine which of the child div comes firstIf you just use css, you can use flex.CSS really shouldn't be used to restructure the HTML backend. However, it is possible if you know the height of both elements involved and are feeling hackish. Also, text selection will be messed up when going between the divs, but that's because the HTML and CSS order are opposite.Where XXX and YYY are the heights of firstDiv and secondDiv respectively. This will work with trailing elements, unlike the top answer.I have a much better code, made by me, it is so big, just to show both things... create a 4x4 table and vertical align more than just one cell.It does not use any IE hack, no vertical-align:middle; at all... It does not use for vertical centering display-table, display:table-rom; display:table-cell;It uses the trick of a container that has two divs, one hidden (position is not the correct but makes parent have the correct variable size), one visible just after the hidden but with top:-50%; so it is mover to correct position.See div classes that make the trick:\n BloqueTipoContenedor\n   BloqueTipoContenedor_VerticalmenteCentrado\n     BloqueTipoContenido_VerticalmenteCentrado_Oculto\n     BloqueTipoContenido_VerticalmenteCentrado_VisiblePlease sorry for using Spanish on classes names (it is because i speak spanish and this is so tricky that if i use English i get lost).The full code:Little late to the party, but you can also do this:Or set an absolute position to the element and work off the margins by declaring them from the edge of the page rather than the edge of the object.

Strictly speaking disabled is not supported for <a> but browsers won't complain for unknown attributes. Using the disabled attribute IE will ignore pointer-events but it will honor IE specific disabled attribute; other CSS compliant browsers will ignore unknown disabled attribute and honor pointer-events. Easier to write than to explain:Another option for IE 11 is to set display of link elements to block or inline-block:Note that this may be a portable solution if you need to support IE (and you can change your HTML) but...All this said please note that pointer-events disables only...pointer events. Links will still be navigable through keyboard then you also need to apply one of the other techniques described here.In conjunction with above described CSS technique you may use tabindex in a non-standard way to prevent an element to be focused:I never checked its compatibility with many browsers then you may want to test it by yourself before using this. It has the advantage to work without JavaScript. Unfortunately (but obviously) tabindex cannot be changed from CSS.Use a href to a JavaScript function, check for the condition (or the disabled attribute itself) and do nothing in case.To disable links do this:To re-enable them:If you want instead of .is(\"[disabled]\") you may use .attr(\"disabled\") != undefined (jQuery 1.6+ will always return undefined when the attribute is not set) but is() is much more clear (thanks to Dave  Stewart for this tip). Please note here I'm using the disabled attribute in a non-standard way, if you care about this then replace attribute with a class and replace .is(\"[disabled]\") with .hasClass(\"disabled\") (adding and removing with addClass() and removeClass()).Zoltán Tamási noted in a comment that \"in some cases the click event is already bound to some \"real\" function (for example using knockoutjs) In that case the event handler ordering can cause some troubles. Hence I implemented disabled links by binding a return false handler to the link's touchstart, mousedown and keydown events. It has some drawbacks (it will prevent touch scrolling started on the link)\" but handling keyboard events also has the benefit to prevent keyboard navigation.Note that if href isn't cleared it's possible for the user to manually visit that page.Clear the href attribute. With this code you do not add an event handler but you change the link itself. Use this code to disable links:And this one to re-enable them:Personally I do not like this solution very much (if you do not have to do more with disabled links) but it may be more compatible because of various way to follow a link.Add/remove an onclick function where you return false, link won't be followed. To disable links:To re-enable them:I do not think there is a reason to prefer this solution instead of the first one.Styling is even more simple, whatever solution you're using to disable the link we did add a disabled attribute so you can use following CSS rule:If you're using a class instead of attribute:If you're using an UI framework you may see that disabled links aren't styled properly. Bootstrap 3.x, for example, handles this scenario and button is correctly styled both with disabled attribute and with .disabled class. If, instead, you're clearing the link (or using one of the others JavaScript techniques) you must also handle styling because an <a> without href is still painted as enabled. Do not forget to also include an attribute aria-disabled=\"true\" together with disabled attribute/class.Got the fix in css. Above css when applied to the anchor tag will disable the click event.For details checkout this linkThanks to everyone that posted solutions (especially @AdrianoRepetti), I combined multiple approaches to provide some more advanced disabled functionality (and it works cross browser). The code is below (both ES2015 and coffeescript based on your preference).This provides for multiple levels of defense so that Anchors marked as disable actually behave as such.\nUsing this approach, you get an anchor that you cannot:npm install -S key.jsTry the element:Disabling a link works for me in Chrome: http://jsfiddle.net/KeesCBakker/LGYpz/.Firefox doesn't seem to play nice. This example works:Note: added a 'live' statement for future disabled / enabled links.\nNote2: changed 'live' into 'on'.I've ended up with the solution below, which can work with either an attribute, <a href=\"...\" disabled=\"disabled\">, or a class <a href=\"...\" class=\"disabled\">:CSS Styles:Javascript (in jQuery ready):Bootstrap 4.1 provides a class named disabled and aria-disabled=\"true\" attribute.example\"More is on getbootstrap.comSo if you want to make it dynamically, and you don't want to care if it is button or ancor than\nin JS script you need something like thatBut be carefullThe solution only works on links with classes btn btn-link.Sometimes bootstrap recommends using card-link class, in this case solution will not work.you cannot disable a link, if you want that click event should not fire then simply Remove the action from that link.For More Info :-  Elements that can be DisabledI would do something likesomething like this should work. You add a class for links you want to have disabled and then you return false when someone click them. To enable them just remove the class.To disable link to access another page on touch device:In Razor (.cshtml) you can do:You can use this to disabled the Hyperlink of asp.net or link buttons in html.There is one other possible way, and the one that I like best. Basically it's the same way lightbox disables a whole page, by placing a div and fiddling with z-index. Here is relevant snippets from a project of mine. This works in all browsers!!!!!Javascript (jQuery):and in htmlSo the resizer finds the anchor's (the images are just arrows) locations and places the disabler on top. The disabler's image is a translucent grey square (change the width/height of the disablers in the html to match your link) to show that it is disabled. The floating allows the page to resize dynamically, and the disablers will follow suit in windowResizer(). You can find suitable images through google. I have placed the relevant css inline for simplicity.then based on some condition, I think a lot of these are over thinking. Add a class of whatever you want, like disabled_link. Then make the css have .disabled_link { display: none }\n\nBoom now the user can't see the link so you won't have to worry about them clicking it. If they do something to satisfy the link being clickable, simply remove the class with jQuery: $(\"a.disabled_link\").removeClass(\"super_disabled\"). Boom done!"},

I've then moved the div tag with id=\"footer\" outside of this last \"outer\" div tag.\nI've used CSS to specify the height of \"outer\" and specified the width and height of \"footer\".  I've also used CSS to specify the margin-left and margin-right of \"footer\" as auto.  The result is that the footer sits firmly at the bottom of my page and scrolls with the page too (although, it's still appears inside the \"outer\" div, but happily outside of the main \"content\" div. which seems strange, but it's where I want it).I just want to add - most of the other answers worked fine for me; however, it took a long time to get them working!This is because setting height: 100% only picks up parent div's height!So if your entire html (inside of the body) looks like the following:Then the following will be fine:...as \"holder\" will pick up it's height directly from \"body\".Kudos to My Head Hurts, whose answer was the one I ended up getting to work!However. If your html is more nested (because it's only an element of the full page, or it's within a certain column, etc) then you need to make sure every containing element also has height: 100% set on the div. Otherwise, the information on height will be lost between \"body\" and \"holder\".E.g. the following, where I've added the \"full height\" class to every div to make sure the height gets all the way down to our header/body/footer elements:And remember to set height on full-height class in the css:That fixed my issues!if you have a fixed height footer (for example 712px) you can do this with js like so:use fixed-bottom bootstrap class"},

It has no width or height.You could turn it into a block-level element, then it will accept your dimension directives.Try using a div instead of the span or using the CSS display: block; or display: inline-block;—span is by default an inline element which cannot take width and height properties.Inspired from @Hamed, I added the following and it worked for me:Span takes width and height only when we make it block element.As per comment from @Paul, If display: block is specified, span stops to be an inline element and an element after it appears on next line.I came here to find solution to my span height problem and I got a solution of my ownAdding overflow:hidden; and keeing it inline will solve the problem just tested in IE8 Quirks modespans are by default displayed inline, which means they don't have a height and width.Try adding a display: block to your span.Span starts out as an inline element.  You can change its display attribute to block, for instance, and its height/width attributes will start to take effect.span {display:block;} also adds a line-break.To avoid that, use span {display:inline-block;} and then you can add width and height to the inline element, and you can align it within the block as well:more here"},

As Devon Sans points out in the comments: This feature will most likely be deprecated.From  Angular 4.3.0, all piercing css combinartors were deprecated. Angular team introduced a new combinator ::ng-deep  (still it is at experimental level and not the full and final way) as shown below,DEMO : https://plnkr.co/edit/RBJIszu14o4svHLQt563?p=previewYou can use encapsulation mode and/or piercing CSS combinators >>>, /deep/ and ::shadowworking example : http://plnkr.co/edit/1RBDGQ?p=previewUPDATE 3:::ng-deep is also deprecated which means you should not do this at all anymore. It is unclear how this affects things where you need to override styles in child components from a parent component. To me it seems odd if this gets removed completely because how would this affect things as libraries where you need to override styles in a library component?Comment if you have any insight in this.UPDATE 2:Since /deep/ and all other shadow piercing selectors are now deprecated. Angular dropped ::ng-deep which should be used instead for a broader compatibility. UPDATE:If using Angular-CLI you need to use /deep/ instead of >>> or else it will not work. ORIGINAL:After going to Angular2's Github page and doing a random search for \"style\" I found this question: Angular 2 - innerHTML stylingWhich said to use something that was added in 2.0.0-beta.10, the >>> and ::shadow selectors. So simply doing:In parent's stylesheet file solved the issue. Please note, as stated in the quote above, this solution is only intermediate until more advanced cross-component styling is supported.You should NOT use ::ng-deep, it is deprecated. In Angular, the proper way to change the style of children's component from the parent is to use encapsulation (read the warning below to understand the implications):And then, you will be able to modify the css form your component without a need from ::ng-deepWARNING: Doing this will make all css rules you write for this component to be global.In order to limit the scope of your css to this component only, add a css class to the top tag of your component and put your css \"inside\" this tag:Scss file:Sadly it appears that the /deep/ selector is deprecated (at least in Chrome)\nhttps://www.chromestatus.com/features/6750456638341120In short it appears there is (currently) no long term solution other than to somehow get your child component to style things dynamically.\n You could pass a style object to your child and have it applied via:\n<div [attr.style]=\"styleobject\">\nOr if you have a specific style you can use something like:\n<div [style.background-color]=\"colorvar\">More discussion related to this:\nhttps://github.com/angular/angular/issues/6511Had same issue, so if you're using angular2-cli with scss/sass use '/deep/' instead of '>>>', last selector isn't supported yet (but works great with css).If you want to be more targeted to the actual child component than you should do the follow. This way, if other child components share the same class name, they won't be affected. Plunker:\nhttps://plnkr.co/edit/ooBRp3ROk6fbWPuToytO?p=previewFor example:Hope this helps!codematrixActually there is one more option. Which is rather safe. You can use ViewEncapsulation.None BUT put all your component styles into its tag (aka selector). But anyway always prefer some global style plus encapsulated styles.Here is modified Denis Rybalka example:There are a few options to achieve this in Angular:1) You can use deep css selectors2) You can also change view encapsulation it's set to Emulated as a default but can be easily changed to Native which uses Shadow DOM native browser implementation, in your case you just need to disable it For example:`You should not write CSS rules for a child component elements in a parent component, since an Angular component is a self-contained entity which should explicitly declare what is available for the outside world. If child layout changes in the future, your styles for that child component elements scattered across other components' SCSS files could easily break, thus making your styling very fragile. That's what ViewEncapsulation is for in the case of CSS. Otherwise, it would be the same if you could assign values to private fields of some class from any other class in Object Oriented Programming.Therefore, what you should do is to define a set of classes you could apply to the child host element and implement how the child responds to them.Technically, it could be done as follows:In other words, you use :host pseudo-selector provided by Angular + set of CSS classes to define possible child styles in child component itself. You then have the ability to trigger those styles from outside by applying pre-defined classes to the <child> host element.I find it a lot cleaner to pass an @INPUT variable if you have access to the child component code:The idea is that the parent tells the child what its state of appearance should be, and the child decides how to display the state. It's a nice architecture SCSS Way:Better way: - use selected variable:The quick answer is you shouldn't be doing this, at all. It breaks component encapsulation and undermines the benefit you're getting from self-contained components. Consider passing a prop flag to the child component, it can then decide itself how to render differently or apply different CSS, if necessary.Angular is deprecating all ways of affecting child styles from parents.https://angular.io/guide/component-styles#deprecated-deep--and-ng-deepi also had this problem and didnt wanted to use deprecated solution \nso i ended up with:in parrentchild componentin child in html divand in codeworks like expected and should not be deprecated ;)As the internet updates I've come across a solution.First some caveats.First, mark your child component's encapsulation as shadow so it renders in the actual shadow dom. Second, add the part attribute to the element you wish to allow the parent to style. In your parent's component stylesheet you can use the ::part() method to accessI propose an example to make it more clear, since angular.io/guide/component-styles states:On app.component.scss, import your *.scss if needed. _colors.scss has some common color values:Apply a rule to all componentsAll the buttons having btn-red class will be styled.Apply a rule to a single componentAll the buttons having btn-red class on app-login component will be styled.I have solved it outside Angular. I have defined a shared scss that I'm importing to my children.shared.scsschild.scssMy proposed approach is a way how to solve the problem the OP has asked about. As mentioned at multiple occasions, ::ng-deep, :ng-host will get depreciated and disabling encapsulation is just too much of a code leakage, in my view."},

You can simply put them into a file, save it and open it up with the browser of your choice:This one directly embeds your CSS style into your tags/elements. Generally this is not a very nice approach, because you should always separate the content/html from design. The next one is a more general approach and works on all \"p\" (stands for paragraph) tags in your document and additionaly makes them HUGE. Btw.

Alternatively, you can also use a hard value for font-weight and most fonts support a value between 300 and 700, incremented by 100. For example, the following would be bold:"},

I need to use different css for different screen size.What's the difference?max-width is the width of the target display area, e.g. the browsermax-device-width is the width of the device's entire rendering area, i.e. the actual device screenSame goes for max-height and max-device-height naturally.max-width refers to the width of the viewport and can be used to target specific sizes or orientations in conjunction with max-height. Using multiple max-width (or min-width) conditions you could change the page styling as the browser is resized or the orientation changes on a device like an iPhone.max-device-width refers to the viewport size of the device regardless of orientation, current scale or resizing. This will not change on a device so cannot be used to switch style sheets or CSS directives as the screen is rotated or resized.What do you think about using this style?For all breakpoints which are mostly for \"mobile device\" I use min(max)-device-width and for breakpoints which are mostly for \"desktop\" use min(max)-width. There are a lot of \"mobile devices\" that badly calculate width.Look at http://www.javascriptkit.com/dhtmltutors/cssmediaqueries2.shtml:max-device-width is the device rendering widthThe max-width is the width of the target display area means the current size of browser.the difference is that max-device-width is all screen's width and max-width means the space used by the browser to show the pages. But another important difference is the support of android browsers, in fact if u're going to use max-device-width this will work only in Opera, instead I'm sure that max-width will work for every kind of mobile browser (I had test it in Chrome, firefox and opera for ANDROID).max-width is the width of the target display area, e.g. the browser; max-device-width is the width of the device's entire rendering area, i.e. the actual device screen.•   If you are using the max-device-width, when you change the size of the browser window on your desktop, the CSS style won't change to different media query setting;•   If you are using the max-width, when you change the size of the browser on your desktop, the CSS will change to different media query setting and you might be shown with the styling for mobiles, such as touch-friendly menus.If you are making a cross-platform app (eg. using phonegap/cordova) then,Don't use device-width or device-height. Rather use width or height in CSS media queries because Android device will give problems in device-width or device-height. For iOS it works fine. Only android devices doesn't support device-width/device-height.Don't use device-width/height anymore. device-width, device-height and device-aspect-ratio are deprecated in Media Queries Level 4: \nhttps://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@media#Media_featuresJust use width/height (without min/max) in combination with orientation & (min/max-)resolution to target specific devices. On mobile width/height should be the same as device-width/height."},

Does this vary in different browsers? Any reference about this question?Thanks.EDIT:I did an experiment in Firefox with Firebug. And it shows as the following image:\nAccording to your sample,roughly the execution flow is about as follows:Note that the download may be asynchronous and non-blocking due to behaviours of the browser. For example, in Firefox there is this setting which limits the number of simultaneous requests per domain.Also depending on whether the component has already been cached or not, the component may not be requested again in a near-future request. If the component has been cached, the component will be loaded from the cache instead of the actual URL.When the parsing is ended and document is ready and loaded, the events onload is fired. Thus when onload is fired, the $(\"#img\").attr(\"src\",\"kkk.png\"); is run. So:The $(document).ready() event is actually the event fired when all page components are loaded and ready. Read more about it: http://docs.jquery.com/Tutorials:Introducing_$(document).ready()By default, and from my current understanding, browser usually runs each page on 3 ways: HTML parser, Javascript/DOM, and CSS. The HTML parser is responsible for parsing and interpreting the markup language and thus must be able to make calls to the other 2 components. For example when the parser comes across this line:The parser will make 3 calls, two to Javascript and one to CSS. Firstly, the parser will create this element and register it in the DOM namespace, together with all the attributes related to this element. Secondly, the parser will call to bind the onclick event to this particular element. Lastly, it will make another call to the CSS thread to apply the CSS style to this particular element.The execution is top down and single threaded. Javascript may look multi-threaded, but the fact is that Javascript is single threaded. This is why when loading external javascript file, the parsing of the main HTML page is suspended. However, the CSS files can be download simultaneously because CSS rules are always being applied - meaning to say elements are always repainted with the freshest CSS rules defined - thus making it unblocking.An element will only be available in the DOM after it has been parsed. Thus when working with a specific element, the script is always placed after, or within the window onload event.Script like this will cause error (on jQuery):Because when the script is parsed, #mydiv element is still not defined. Instead this would work:OR1) HTML is downloaded.2) HTML is parsed progressively.  When a request for an asset is reached the browser will attempt to download the asset.  A default configuration for most HTTP servers and most browsers is to process only two requests in parallel.  IE can be reconfigured to downloaded an unlimited number of assets in parallel.  Steve Souders has been able to download over 100 requests in parallel on IE.  The exception is that script requests block parallel asset requests in IE.  This is why it is highly suggested to put all JavaScript in external JavaScript files and put the request just prior to the closing body tag in the HTML.3) Once the HTML is parsed the DOM is rendered.  CSS is rendered in parallel to the rendering of the DOM in nearly all user agents.  As a result it is strongly recommended to put all CSS code into external CSS files that are requested as high as possible in the <head></head> section of the document.  Otherwise the page is rendered up to the occurance of the CSS request position in the DOM and then rendering starts over from the top.4) Only after the DOM is completely rendered and requests for all assets in the page are either resolved or time out does JavaScript execute from the onload event.  IE7, and I am not sure about IE8, does not time out assets quickly if an HTTP response is not received from the asset request.  This means an asset requested by JavaScript inline to the page, that is JavaScript written into HTML  tags that is not contained in a function, can prevent the execution of the onload event for hours.  This problem can be triggered if such inline code exists in the page and fails to execute due to a namespace collision that causes a code crash.Of the above steps the one that is most CPU intensive is the parsing of the DOM/CSS.  If you want your page to be processed faster then write efficient CSS by eliminating redundent instructions and consolidating CSS instructions into the fewest possible element referrences.  Reducing the number of nodes in your DOM tree will also produce faster rendering.Keep in mind that each asset you request from your HTML or even from your CSS/JavaScript assets is requested with a separate HTTP header.  This consumes bandwidth and requires processing per request.  If you want to make your page load as fast as possible then reduce the number of HTTP requests and reduce the size of your HTML.  You are not doing your user experience any favors by averaging page weight at 180k from HTML alone.  Many developers subscribe to some fallacy that a user makes up their mind about the quality of content on the page in 6 nanoseconds and then purges the DNS query from his server and burns his computer if displeased, so instead they provide the most beautiful possible page at 250k of HTML.  Keep your HTML short and sweet so that a user can load your pages faster.  Nothing improves the user experience like a fast and responsive web page.Open your page in Firefox and get the HTTPFox addon. It will tell you all that you need.Found this on archivist.incuito:http://archivist.incutio.com/viewlist/css-discuss/76444If you're asking this because you want to speed up your web site, check out Yahoo's page on Best Practices for Speeding Up Your Web Site. It has a lot of best practices for speeding up your web site.AFAIK, the browser (at least Firefox) requests every resource as soon as it parses it. If it encounters an img tag it will request that image as soon as the img tag has been parsed. And that can be even before it has received the totality of the HTML document... that is it could still be downloading the HTML document when that happens.For Firefox, there are browser queues that apply, depending on how they are set in about:config. For example it will not attempt to download more then 8 files at once from the same server... the additional requests will be queued. I think there are per-domain limits, per proxy limits, and other stuff, which are documented on the Mozilla website and can be set in about:config. I read somewhere that IE has no such limits.The jQuery ready event is fired as soon as the main HTML document has been downloaded and it's DOM parsed. Then the load event is fired once all linked resources (CSS, images, etc.) have been downloaded and parsed as well. It is made clear in the jQuery documentation.If you want to control the order in which all that is loaded, I believe the most reliable way to do it is through JavaScript.Dynatrace AJAX Edition shows you the exact sequence of page loading, parsing and execution.The chosen answer looks like does not apply to modern browsers, at least on Firefox 52. What I observed is that the requests of loading resources like css, javascript are issued before HTML parser reaches the element, for example \n\nWhat I found that the start time of requests to load css and javascript resources were not being blocked. Looks like Firefox has a HTML scan, and identify key resources(img resource is not included) before starting to parse the HTML."},

I did not have caching turned on. But looks like sendfile was set to on in nginx.conf and that was causing the problem. @kolbyjack mentioned it above in the comments.When I turned off sendfile - it worked fine.This is because:It is related to this bug: https://www.virtualbox.org/ticket/12597You can also bypass/re-cache on a file by file basis using and as a bonus you can return this header to see if you got it from the cache (will return 'HIT') or from the content server (will return 'BYPASS').to expire/refresh the cached file, use curl or any rest client to make a request to the cached page.this will return a fresh copy of the item and it will also replace what's in cache.Unless you configured a cache zone via proxy_cache_path and then used it (for example in a location block), via:\nproxy_cache nothing will get cached.If you did, however, then according to the author of nginx, simply removing all files from the cache directory is enough.Simplest way: find /path/to/your/cache -type f -deleteYou can delete cache directory of nginx or You can search specific file:And delete only one file to nginx refresh them.There's two answers in this question.Use:E.G.: I found this usefulSearch, and if found then delete.In my nginx install I found I had to go to:andin that directory. If you know the path to your nginx install and can find the cache directory the same may work for you. Be very careful with the rm -rf command, if you are in the wrong directory you could delete your entire hard drive.I had this problem also. My domain uses cloudflare.com for DNS (great service!). Aha! There it was:cloudflare.com -> caching -> Purge Cache (I purged everything) \nThat solved my problem!I run a very simple bash script which takes all of 10 seconds to do the job and sends me a mail when done.We have a very large nginx cache (gigabytes) that we occasionally need to wipe. I've worked out a script that instantly clears the cache (as far as Nginx is concerned) and then removes the cache directory without starving the main application for disk I/O.In summary:Here's the script, tailored to Ubuntu 16.04 LTS, with the cache located at /mnt/nginx-cache:And in case it's helpful, here's the Nginx config we use:For those who other solutions are not working, check if you're using a DNS service like CloudFlare. In that case activate the \"Development Mode\" or use the \"Purge Cache\" tool.Please take note that proxy_cache_bypass can give you a world of hurt if your app doesn't return a cacheable response for that specific request where you trigger it.If for example your app sends a cookie with every first request, then a script which triggers proxy_pass_bypass via curl will probably get that cookie in the answer, and nginx will not use that response to refresh the cached item.Be careful to properly specify the correct path.For those who have tried deleting the nginx cache files, and either it hasn't worked or has worked intermittently, have a look at your setting for open_file_cache. If this is enabled and configured to cache a file descriptor for a long time, then Nginx may still see a version of the cached file, even after you've deleted it from disk. I had to reduce open_file_cache_valid to 1s (I'm not certain if this is essentially the same as disabling the file cache completely).On my server, the nginx cache folder is at /data/nginx/cache/So I removed it only: sudo rm -rf /data/nginx/cache/Hope this will help anyone.If you want to clear the cache of specific files then you can use the proxy_cache_bypass directive. This is how you do itNow if you want bypass the cache you access the file by passing the nocache parameter http://www.example.com/app.css?nocache=trueYou can add configuration in nginx.conf like the following.From above, a folder named \"nginx_cache\" is dynamicly created in /tmp/ to store cached content.There is one right method to remove only cache-files, which matches any KEY. For example:This removes all cache-files, which matches to KEY \"yahoo/*\", if in nginx.conf was set:We use nginx for caching lots of stuff. There are tens of thousands of items in the cache directory. To find items and delete them, we have developed a some scripts to simplify this process. You can find the repository for this scripts below:https://github.com/zafergurel/nginx-cache-cleanerThe idea is simple. To create an index of the cache (with cache keys and corresponding cache files) and search within this index file. It really helped us to speed-up finding items (from minutes to sub-second) and delete them accordingly.In my case, touch that Css file, make it looks like resources changed (actually touch does nothing to the file, except change last modify time), so browser and nginx will apply latest resourcesI was experiencing a kind of similar issue:System setup and Problem:\n(On a virtualbox I'm web hosting using ubuntu and nginx - PHP webpage refreshes did not reflect changes to external css file). I'm developing website on windows machine and transferring files to nginx via shared folder. It seems nginx does not pick up changes to css file (refreshing in any fashion does not help. Changing css file name is only thing that worked)Solution:\nOn VM find shared file (css file in my case). Open with nano and compare to file in windows share (they appear identical). On VM save shared file with nano. All changes are now reflected in browser. Not sure why this works but it did in my case.UPDATE: After rebooting the VM server the problem returned. Following the instructions under Solution made the css responsive to updates againIn my case it was the enabled opcache in /etc/php/7.2/fpm/php.ini (Ubuntu):Setting it to 0 made the server loading the latest version of the (php)files.

Note that your existing title (and original post) ask a question different than what you seek in your edit and subsequent comment.To position an element \"fixed\" relative to a parent element, you want position:absolute on the child element, and any position mode other than the default or static on your parent element.For example:This will position childDiv element 50 pixels left and 20 pixels down relative to parentDiv's position.To position an element \"fixed\" relative to the window, you want position:fixed, and can use top:, left:, right:, and bottom: to position as you see fit. For example:This will position yourDiv fixed relative to the web browser window, 40 pixels from the bottom edge and 40 pixels from the right edge.The CSS specification requires that position:fixed be anchored to the viewport, not the containing positioned element.If you must specify your coordinates relative to a parent, you will have to use JavaScript to find the parent's position relative to the viewport first, then set the child (fixed) element's position accordingly.ALTERNATIVE: Some browsers have sticky CSS support which limits an element to be positioned within both its container and the viewport. Per the commit message:Depending on your design goals, this behavior may be helpful in some cases. It is currently a working draft, and has decent support, aside from table elements. position: sticky still needs a -webkit prefix in Safari.See caniuse for up-to-date stats on browser support.first, set position: fixed and  left: 50%, and second — now your start is a center and you can set new position with margin.It's now possible in modern browsers to position an element fixed relative to its container. An element that has a transform property acts as the viewport for any of its fixed position child elements.Or as the CSS Transforms Module puts it:I know this is super old but after not finding the (pure CSS) answer I was looking for I came up with this solution (partially abstracted from medium.com) and thought it might help others looking to do the same thing. If you combine @DuckMaestro's answers you can position an element fixed relative to a parent (actually grandparent). Use position: absolute; to position an element inside a parent with position: relative; and then position: fixed; on an element inside the absolute positioned element like so:EXAMPLELike @JonAdams said, the definition of position: fixed requires the element to be positioned relative to the viewport but you can get around the horizontal aspect of that using this solution. Note: This is different than just setting a right or left value on the fixed element because that would cause it to move horizontally when a window is resized. Here is an example of Jon Adams suggestion above in order to fix a div (toolbar) to the right hand side of your page element using jQuery. The idea is to find the distance from the right hand side of the viewport to the right hand side of the page element and to keep the right hand side of the toolbar there!  It's an old post but i'll leave here my javascript solution just in case someone need it.Notes This solution works for me!

Check out the side menu located here: https://stackoverflow.com/faq#questions.  Looking at it without getting into it too deep, I can tell javascript attaches a fixed position once the scrolling hits below the anchor tag and removes the fixed positioning if the scrolling goes above that same anchor tag.

Check this jsfiddleYou can change the height or width of the Before or After element like this:I used this font size control widthNowadays with flexbox you can greatly simplify your code and only adjust 1 parameter as needed:Now you can just adjust the width of the element and the height will automatically adjust, increase/decrease the width until the height of the element is at the number you need.

Or read:  CDN/X-Domain SetupNote See also: https://github.com/scottjehl/Respond/pull/206Update:Please read: http://getbootstrap.com/getting-started/#supportSee also: https://github.com/scottjehl/RespondFor this reason the basic template contains these lines in the head section:I also had to set the following META tag:I had this same issue when transitioning from Bootstrap 2 to 3.  I'd already got respond.js and html5shiv.js and set my meta to edge.  I'd missed that from 2 to 3 the navbar element type had changed.  In Bootstrap 2 it was nav.  In Bootstrap 3 it's now header.  So to fully resolve the problem I had toPut this right after I'd loaded my css:and then change toOh and for good measure I also addedsimply because that's what the Bootstrap site itself has.In my case, the bootstrap minified CSS was causing the issue.\nTo make bootstrap 3.0.2 responsive in IE8 (emulated using the F12 Developer Tools) I had to:1 - Set the X-UA-Compatible flag.2 - Use the non-minified bootstrap.css, instead of bootstrap.min.css3 - Add the respond.js (and html5shiv.js)put respond.js at bottom of page but before closing body tag and here is link of respond.js and run this code in your localhost.https://github.com/scottjehl/RespondJust in case.  Make sure you load the IE specific js files after you load your css files.Don't forget to place your css links in the <head> as respond.js takes only those.As previously stated there are two different problems: \n1) IE8 doesn't support media queries\n2) respond.js used in conjunction with cross-domain css files must be included as described before.If you want to use BootstrapCDN here's a working example:Also make sure to copy respond.proxy.gif, respond.min.js and response.proxy.js in local directoriesAfter verifying:Still col-lg, col-md, and col-sm were not working.  Finally I moved the references to bootstrap to be before the references to html5shiv.js and respond.js and it all worked.Here is a snippet:From the explanation it says that IE8 is the standard version for you and making content=\"IE=edge\" will render the page in the highest mode. To make it compatible change it to content=\"IE=8\".Reference What does <meta http-equiv=\"X-UA-Compatible\" content=\"IE=edge\"> do?Needed to add - <meta http-equiv=\"X-UA-Compatible\" content=\"IE=edge\">I was using Bootstrap 3 - had it working on IE on my local. I put it live didn't work in IE.Just Bootstrap doesn't include that line of code in their templates, I'm not sure why but it might be due to it not being W3C compatible.I have a  fix for this issue. Actually IE7 and 8 doesnt support the @media properly and if you check the css for “col-md-*” classes and there width is given in media width 992px. Just create a new css file IE eg: IE.css and add in the conditional comments. And then just copy the classes required for your design directly with any media queries there and you are done.I had exactly the same problem when migrating from bootstrapv2 to v3.If (like me) you migrated by replacing the old spanX with col-sm-X you also need to add col-X classes. col-X are the styles that are outside of any @media blocks so they work without media query support.To fix the container width you can set it yourself outside of a @media block. Something like:I've suffer the same problem in IE 10.0. I know this is not exactly the problem in the OP, but maybe it will be usefull for others.In my case, I had an empty line at the beginning of the document:If the blank line is between the DOCTYPE and the  tag, the problem is also shown:Once I've removed the blank line, and without the magic X-UA-Compatible meta, IE 10 has started to render the site correctly.If you are using PHP and Smarty be careful with your Smarty comments because they will add those problematic blank lines :-)my head tag is like this:if you want to try in local...try through localhost, or create a QA server and set the content and try. We need respond.js for bootstrap 3 and it wont work in local machine if we just put it in js and append it to html in header. It will say access denied. it works only through server as IE has security restriction. :PI've read every comment here, tried everything.. but couldn't get it to work with Windows 7 - Internet Explorer 11 (with document mode: IE8).Then it came to mind that running a document mode (IE8) isn't the same as the real IE8, so I installed Windows Virtual PC (Windows 7 with Internet Explorer 8) and tadaaaa... it works like a charm!I've put this piece of code JUST at the bottom of the page to make it work:Just as a heads up. I had the same problem and none of the above fixed it for me. Eventually I found out that respond.js doesn't parse CSS referenced via @import. I had the whole bootstrap.min.css imported via @import into my main.css.So make sure you don't have any CSS that contains your media queries referenced via @import.I have resolved below steps.(1) installed Respond.js module for drupal 7.\n(2) lessphp module for drupal 7 set in libraries, instead of module folder.\n(3) \n(3.1)<meta http-equiv=\"X-UA-Compatible\" content=\"IE=edge\">(3.2)using cdn bootstrap from theme setting.To learn more, review my website blog for drupal design and development www.devangsolanki.comIf you use Bootstrap 3 and everything works fine on other browsers except IE, try the below.Use this solution This string <script src=\"js/css3-mediaqueries.js\"></script> enable mediaqueries.\nThis string <link rel=\"stylesheet\" type=\"text/css\" href=\"css/bootstrap-ie7.css\" /> enable bootstrap fonts.Tested on Bootstrap 3.3.5Link to download  mediaqieries.js.\nLink to download  bootstrap-ie7.cssIf you use LESS or SASS don't be to greedy with compiling the styles.\nIn my project I included bootstrap.min.css in my  main style, on the top of the file - so there should be only one request for all styles.And because of that, the boostrap classes did not work properly.\nWhen added separately, works as expected.I faced the same problem, tried the first answer but something was missing.If you guys are using Webpack, your css will be loaded as a style tag which is not supported by respond.js, it needs a file, so make sure bootstrap is loaded as a css filePersonally I used extract-text-webpack-plugin Hope it will help you"},

No browser has implemented this extremely useful feature (think of inline blocks in general) yet. :-(What I did from time to time, although it's ugly as the night is dark, is to use comments:you can set the font-size of the container to 0 and the white-space disappears!The browsers does ignore whitespace in most cases when it's next to a block element.The problem with images (in this case) is that they are inline elements, so while you write them on separate lines, they are actually elements on the same line with a space between them (as the line break counts as a space). It would be incorrect for the browser to remove the spaces between the images, writing the image tags with line breaks between them should be handled the same way as writing the image tags on the same line with spaces between them.You can use CSS to make the images block elements and float them next to each other, that solves a lot of problems with spacing, both the space between the images and the spacing on the text line below images.Unfortunately, newlines count as space characters.The best solution I have come up with is to use the whitespace inside the tags themselves, instead of outside:It's not ideal, either, I know. But at least it's not some bizarre CSS hack that relies on the size a space character is rendered or resorting to relative positioning, or JavaScript :)The newest solution for this is using display: flex on outside container, you can try this with following example:Codepen →(And yes, Flexbox is becoming widely supported: http://caniuse.com/#search=flexbox)HTML:CSS\nUpdate: Also, if you want your items to wrap (as standard inline-block elements do), don't forget to add flex-wrap: wrap to your flexbox container.OK, I might be lucky in that I only have to worry right now about getting this to work in webkit (specifically the one embedded in QT) so it works in Chrome and Safari too. Seems display: table-cell has all the benefits of display: inline-block, but without the whitespace drawback (think indented td's)What was so difficult about this solution?Images are per default inline elements, that’s why you see whitespace between them. If you listen to your example in a screen reader, you immediately know why: without whitespace, you’d hear: So, use my mini thing. (dot plus whitespace at the end) as alt text or push the images with CSS together. Do not just remove the whitespace in the code.If you're using php, this works wonderfully. I found the solution here.I was originally looking for something to remove text nodes consisting of only whitespace after parsing html with something like simplexml, but this is much cheaper.This is a simple question and the answer is not so simple.One can try to avoid the spaces in the source code which is not always achievable in CMS, because there they are automatically inserted by the system. If you want to change this you have to dig deep inte the CMS's core code.Then you can try to use left floated images. But this is dangerous. At first you don't really have a control over vertical-alignment by definition. And secondly, you run into total chaos if you have so many floated elements, that they stretch over more than one line. And if you have a layout that relies on left floated elements (most of them do so today) you can even break some outer floating styles, if you clear floating after the images. This can be overridden, if you float any surrounding element. Rather not to be recommended.So the only solution would be a CSS declaration that handles the process of whitespace handling. This is not part of any standard (as CSS 3 is not yet finished).I prefer the no whitespace in HTML variant. With using drupal as CMS this can be achieved rather easy in your template.php and theming files. Then I choose inline-block.P.S.:\ninline-block is rather complicated to get in the different browsers.\nFor FF 2 you need display: -moz-inline-box.\nThe rest and IE8 can have display: inline-block right after.\nAnd for lte IE 7 you need display: inline in a following separate declaration (preferrably via conditional comments).editWhat I use for making a element inline-blockTry this CSS:Minify your HTML!It is good practice to minify the response before it is rendered to the browser.So unless you need the space (and you hard coded it using &nbsp;), you always remove the spaces in the minification process."},

But what would it be?I looked into this a bit more and the actual problem seems to be with assigning initial to page width under the print media rule. It seems like in Chrome width: initial on the .page element results in scaling of the page content if no specific length value is defined for width on any of the parent elements (width: initial in this case resolves to width: auto ... but actually any value smaller than the size defined under the @page rule causes the same issue).So not only the content is now too long for the page (by about 2cm), but also the page padding will be slightly more than the initial 2cm and so on (it seems to render the contents under width: auto to the width of ~196mm and then scale the whole content up to the width of 210mm ~ but strangely exactly the same scaling factor is applied to contents with any width smaller than 210mm).To fix this problem you can simply in the print media rule assign the A4 paper width and hight to html, body or directly to .page and in this case avoid the initial keyword.This seems to keep everything else the way it is in your original CSS and fix the problem in Chrome (tested in different versions of Chrome under Windows, OS X and Ubuntu).CSSHTMLDEMOhttps://github.com/cognitom/paper-css seems to solve all my needs."},

Since it is based on jQuery, this should work in other jQuery supported browsers as well.If you only care about modern browsers, a fixed header can be achieved much easier by using CSS transforms. Sounds odd, but works great:Support for CSS transforms is widely available except for Internet Explorer 8-.Here is the full example for reference:I've just completed putting together a jQuery plugin that will take valid single table using valid HTML (have to have a thead and tbody) and will output a table that has fixed headers, optional fixed footer that can either be a cloned header or any content you chose (pagination, etc.).  If you want to take advantage of larger monitors it will also resize the table when the browser is resized.  Another added feature is being able to side scroll if the table columns can not all fit in view.http://fixedheadertable.com/on github: http://markmalek.github.com/Fixed-Header-Table/It's extremely easy to setup and you can create your own custom styles for it.  It also uses rounded corners in all browsers.  Keep in mind I just released it, so it's still technically beta and there are very few minor issues I'm ironing out.It works in Internet Explorer 7, Internet Explorer 8, Safari, Firefox and Chrome.I also created a plugin that addresses this issue. My project - jQuery.floatThead has been around for over 4 years now and is very mature.It requires no external styles and does not expect your table to be styled in any particular way. It supports Internet Explorer9+ and Firefox/Chrome.Currently (2018-05) it has:Many (not all) of the answers here are quick hacks that may have solved the problem one person was having, but will work not for every table.Some of the other plugins are old and probably work great with Internet Explorer, but will break on Firefox and Chrome.If you target modern browsers and don't have extravagant styling needs: http://jsfiddle.net/dPixie/byB9d/3/ ... Although the big four version is pretty sweet as well this version handles fluid width a lot better.With the advances of HTML5 and CSS3 this is now possible, at least for modern browsers. The slightly hackish implementation I came up with can be found here: http://jsfiddle.net/dPixie/byB9d/3/. I have tested it in FX 25, Chrome 31 and IE 10 ...Relevant HTML (insert a HTML5 doctype at the top of your document though):Simply put you have a table header, that you visually hide by making it 0px high, that also contains divs used as the fixed header. The table's container leaves enough room at the top to allow for the absolutely positioned header, and the table with scrollbars appear as you would expect.The code above uses the positioned class to position the table absolutely (I'm using it in a popup style dialog) but you can use it in the flow of the document as well by removing the positioned class from the container.It's not perfect. Firefox refuses to make the header row 0px (at least I did not find any way) but stubbornly keeps it at minimum 4px ... It's not a huge problem, but depending on your styling it will mess with your borders etc.The table is also using a faux column approach where the background color of the container itself is used as the background for the header divs, that are transparent.All in all there might be styling issues depending on your requirements, especially borders or complicated backgrounds. There might also be problems with computability, I haven't checked it in a wide variety of browsers yet (please comment with your experiences if you try it out), but I didn't find anything like it so I thought it was worth posting anyway ...All of the attempts to solve this from outside the CSS specification are pale shadows of what we really want: Delivery on the implied promise of THEAD.This frozen-headers-for-a-table issue has been an open wound in HTML/CSS for a long time.In a perfect world, there would be a pure-CSS solution for this problem. Unfortunately, there doesn't seem to be a good one in place.Relevant standards-discussions on this topic include:UPDATE: Firefox shipped position:sticky in version 32. Everyone wins!Here is a jQuery plugin for fixed table headers. It allows the entire page to scroll, freezing the header when it reaches the top. It works well with Twitter Bootstrap tables.GitHub repository: https://github.com/oma/table-fixed-headerIt does not scroll only table content. Look to other tools for that, as one of these other answers. You decide what fits your case the best.Most of the solutions posted here require jQuery. If you are looking for a framework independent solution try Grid: http://www.matts411.com/post/grid/It's hosted on Github here: https://github.com/mmurph211/GridNot only does it support fixed headers, it also supports fixed left columns and footers, among other things.The CSS property position: sticky has great support in most modern browsers (I had issues with Edge, see below).This lets us solve the problem of fixed headers quite easily:Safari needs a vendor prefix: -webkit-sticky.For Firefox, I had to add min-height: 0 to one the parent elements. I forget exactly why this was needed.Most unfortunately, the Microsoft Edge implementation seems to be only semi-working. At least, I had some flickering and misaligned table cells in my testing. The table was still usable, but had significant aesthetic issues.All of the pure CSS solutions I've seen so far-- clever though they may be-- lack a certain level of polish, or just don't work right in some situations. So, I decided to create my own...Features:Here are a couple of fiddles that show the fluid and auto width options:The Auto Width, Fixed Height configuration probably has more use cases, so I'll post the code below.The method I used to freeze the header row is similar to d-Pixie's, so refer to his post for an explanation. There were a slew of bugs and limitations with that technique that could only be fixed with heaps of additional CSS and an extra div container or two.This is a variation on Mahes' solution. You can call it like $('table#foo').scrollableTable();The idea is:The CSS could be:That said, it works for my purposes and you're free to take and modify it.Here's the plugin::) Not-so-clean, but pure HTML/CSS solution.Updated for IE8+\nJSFiddle exampleI extended Nathan's function to also support a fixed footer and maximum height.\nAlso, the function will set the CSS itself, and you only have to support a width.Usage:Fixed height:Maximum height (if the browser supports the CSS 'max-height' option):Script:Two divs, one for header, one for data.  Make the data div scrollable, and use JavaScript to set the width of the columns in the header to be the same as the widths in the data.  I think the data columns widths need to be fixed rather than dynamic.Somehow I ended up with Position:Sticky working fine on my case:I realize the question allows JavaScript, but here is a pure CSS solution I worked up that also allows for the table to expand horizontally. It was tested with Internet Explorer 10 and the latest Chrome and Firefox browsers. A link to jsFiddle is at the bottom.The HTML:And the CSS:http://jsfiddle.net/HNHRv/3/For those who tried the nice solution given by Maximilian Hils, and did not succeed to get it to work with Internet Explorer, I had the same problem (Internet Explorer 11) and found out what was the problem.In Internet Explorer 11 the style transform (at least with translate) does not work on <THEAD>. I solved this by instead applying the style to all the <TH> in a loop. That worked. My JavaScript code looks like this:In my case the table was a GridView in ASP.NET. First I thought it was because it had no <THEAD>, but even when I forced it to have one, it did not work. Then I found out what I wrote above.It is a very nice and simple solution. On Chrome it is perfect, on Firefox a bit jerky, and on Internet Explorer even more jerky. But all in all a good solution.I wish I had found @Mark's solution earlier, but I went and wrote my own before I saw this SO question...Mine is a very lightweight jQuery plugin that supports fixed header, footer, column spanning (colspan), resizing, horizontal scrolling, and an optional number of rows to display before scrolling starts.jQuery.scrollTableBody (GitHub)As long as you have a table with proper <thead>, <tbody>, and (optional) <tfoot>, all you need to do is this:I found this workaround - move header row in a table above table with data:By applying the StickyTableHeaders jQuery plugin to the table, the column headers will stick to the top of the viewport as you scroll down. Example:I like Maximillian Hils' answer but I had a some issues:To get rid of the flicker, I use a timeout to wait until the user has finished scrolling, then I apply the transform - so the header is not visible during scrolling. I have also written this using jQuery, one advantage of that being that jQuery should handle vendor-prefixes for youThe table is wrapped in a div with the class table-container-fixed.I set border-collapse to separate because otherwise we lose borders during translation, and I remove the border on the table to stop content appearing just above the cell where the border was during scrolling.I make the th background white to cover the cells underneath, and I add a border that matches the table border - which is styled using Bootstrap and scrolled out of view.Use the latest version of jQuery, and include the following JavaScript code.This is not an exact solution to the fixed header row, but I have created a rather ingenious method of repeating the header row throughout the long table, yet still keeping the ability to sort.This neat little option requires the jQuery tablesorter plugin. Here's how it works:HTMLObviously, my table has many more rows than this. 193 to be exact, but you can see where the header row repeats. The repeating header row is set up by this function:jQueryA lot of people seem to be looking for this answer. I found it buried in an answer to another question here: Syncing column width of between tables in two different frames, etcOf the dozens of methods I have tried this is the only method I found that works reliably to allow you to have a scrolling bottom table with the header table having the same widths.Here is how I did it, first I improved upon the jsfiddle above to create this function, which works on both td and th (in case that trips up others who use th for styling of their header rows).Next, you need to create two tables, NOTE the header table should have an extra TD to leave room in the top table for the scrollbar, like this:Then do something like:This is the only solution that I found on Stack Overflow that works out of many similar questions that have been posted, that works in all my cases.For example, I tried the jQuery stickytables plugin which does not work with durandal, and the Google Code project here https://code.google.com/p/js-scroll-table-header/issues/detail?id=2Other solutions involving cloning the tables, have poor performance, or suck and don't work in all cases.There is no need for these overly complex solutions. Just make two tables like the examples below and call setHeaderTableWidth function like described here and boom, you are done.If this does not work for you, you probably were playing with your CSS box-sizing property and you need to set it correctly. It is easy to screw up your CSS content by accident. There are many things that can go wrong, so just be aware/careful of that. This approach works for me.Here's a solution that we ended up working with (in order to deal with some edge cases and older versions of Internet Explorer, we eventually also faded out the title bar on scroll then faded it back in when scrolling ends, but in Firefox and WebKit browsers this solution just works. It assumes border-collapse: collapse.The key to this solution is that once you apply border-collapse, CSS transforms work on the header, so it's just a matter of intercepting scroll events and setting the transform correctly. You don't need to duplicate anything. Short of this behavior being implemented properly in the browser, it's hard to imagine a more light-weight solution.JSFiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/podperson/tH9VU/2/It's implemented as a simple jQuery plugin. You simply make your thead's sticky with a call like $('thead').sticky(), and they'll hang around. It works for multiple tables on a page and head sections halfway down big tables.Here is an improved answer to the one posted by Maximilian Hils.This one works in Internet Explorer 11 with no flickering whatsoever:I developed a simple light-weight jQuery plug-in for converting a well formatted HTML table to a scrollable table with fixed table header and columns.The plugin works well to match pixel-to-pixel positioning the fixed section with the scrollable section. Additionally, you could also freeze the number of columns that will be always in view when scrolling horizontally.

Links to known issues, or reasoning behind this behavior would also be useful.Flexbox makes centering very easy.By simply applying align-items: center and justify-content: center to the flex container, your flex item(s) will be vertically and horizontally centered.However, there is a problem with this method when the flex item is bigger than the flex container.As noted in the question, when the flex item overflows the container the top becomes inaccessible.For horizontal overflow, the left section becomes inaccessible (or right section, in RTL languages).Here's an example with an LTR container having justify-content: center and three flex items:See the bottom of this answer for an explanation of this behavior.To fix this problem use flexbox auto margins, instead of justify-content.With auto margins, an overflowing flex item can be vertically and horizontally centered without losing access to any part of it.So instead of this code on the flex container:Use this code on the flex item:Revised DemoAdd the safe value to your keyword alignment rule, like this:orFrom the CSS Box Alignment Module specification:Note: The Box Alignment Module is for use across multiple box layout models, not just flex. So in the spec excerpt above, the terms in brackets actually say \"alignment subject\", \"alignment container\" and \"start\".  I used flex-specific terms to keep the focus on this particular problem.Well, as Murphy's Law would have it, the reading I did after posting this question resulted in a few results -- not completely resolved, but somewhat useful nonetheless.I played around with min-height a bit before posting, but was not aware of the intrinsic sizing constraints that are fairly new to the spec.http://caniuse.com/#feat=intrinsic-widthAdding a min-height: min-content to the flexbox area does resolve the issue in Chrome, and with vendor prefixes also fixes Opera and Safari, though Firefox remains unresolved.Still looking for ideas on Firefox, and other potential solutions.I managed to pull this off with just 3 containers. The trick is to separate the flexbox container from the container that controls the scrolling. Lastly, put everything into a root container to center it all. Here are the essential styles to create the effect:CSS:HTML:I've created a demo here: https://jsfiddle.net/r5jxtgba/14/I think I found a solution. It works with lots of text and a little text.

The right <div> is about 200px; and the left <div> must fill up the rest of the screen width? How can I do this?You can use flexbox to lay out your items:This is basically just scraping the surface of flexbox. Flexbox can do pretty amazing things.For older browser support, you can use CSS float and a width properties to solve it.I don't know if this is still a current issue or not but I just encountered the same problem and used the CSS display: inline-block; tag.\nWrapping these in a div so that they can be positioned appropriately. Note that the use of the inline style attribute was only used for the succinctness of this example of course these used be moved to an external CSS file.Unfortunately, this is not a trivial thing to solve for the general case. The easiest thing would be to add a css-style property \"float: right;\" to your 200px div, however, this would also cause your \"main\"-div to actually be full width and any text in there would float around the edge of the 200px-div, which often looks weird, depending on the content (pretty much in all cases except if it's a floating image).EDIT:\nAs suggested by Dom, the wrapping problem could of course be solved with a margin. Silly me.The method suggested by @roe and @MohitNanda work, but if the right div is set as float:right;, then it must come first in the HTML source. This breaks the left-to-right read order, which could be confusing if the page is displayed with styles turned off. If that's the case, it might be better to use a wrapper div and absolute positioning:Demonstrated:Edit: Hmm, interesting. The preview window shows the correctly formatted divs, but the rendered post item does not. Sorry then, you'll have to try it for yourself.I ran into this problem today. Based on the solutions above, this worked for me:Simply make the parent div span the full width and float the divs contained within.UPDATEIf you need to place elements in a row, you can use Flex Layout. Here you have another Flex tutorial. It's a great CSS tool and even though it is not 100% compatible, each day its support is getting better. This works as simple as:HTMLCSSAnd what you get here is a container with a total size of 4 units, that share the space with its children in a relation of 1/4 and 3/4.I have done an example in CodePen that solves your problem. I hope it helps.http://codepen.io/timbergus/pen/aOoQLR?editors=110VERY OLDMaybe this is just a nonsense, but have you tried with a table? It not use directly CSS for positioning the divs, but it works fine.You can create a 1x2 table and put your divs inside, and then formatting the table with CSS to put them as you want:NoteIf you want to avoid using the table, as said before, you can use float: left; and float: right;and in the following element, don't forget to add a clear: left;, clear: right; or clear: both; in order to have the position cleaned.This will work OK as long as you set clear: both for the element that separates this two column block.I ran into the same problem and Mohits version works. If you want to keep your left-right order in the html, just try this. In my case, the left div is adjusting the size, the right div stays at width 260px.HTMLCSSThe trick is to use a right padding on the main box but use that space again by placing the right box again with margin-right.As everyone has pointed out, you'll do this by setting a float:right; on the RHS content and a negative margin on the LHS.However.. if you don't use a float: left; on the LHS (as Mohit does) then you'll get a stepping effect because the LHS div is still going to consume the margin'd space in layout.However.. the LHS float will shrink-wrap the content, so you'll need to insert a defined width childnode if that's not acceptable, at which point you may as well have defined the width on the parent.However.. as David points out you can change the read-order of the markup to avoid the LHS float requirement, but that's has readability and possibly accessibility issues.However.. this problem can be solved with floats given some additional markup(caveat: I don't approve of the .clearing div at that example, see here for details)All things considered, I think most of us wish there was a non-greedy width:remaining in CSS3...This won't be the answer for everyone, since it is not supported in IE7-, but you could use it and then use an alternate answer for IE7-. It is display: table, display: table-row and display: table-cell. Note that this is not using tables for layout, but styling divs so that things line up nicely with out all the hassle from above. Mine is an html5 app, so it works great.This article shows an example: http://www.sitepoint.com/table-based-layout-is-the-next-big-thing/Here is what your stylesheet will look like:I use a mixture of float and overflow-x:hidden. Minimal code, always works.https://jsfiddle.net/9934sc4d/4/ - PLUS you don't need to clear your float!To paraphrase one of my websites that does something similar:just use a z-index and everything will sit nice. make sure to have positions marked as fixed or absolute. then nothing will move around like with a float tag."},

So just set the first value to 0px and the second to whatever offset you'd like as follows:For more info on box shadows, check out these: I hope this helps.Just use the spread parameter to make the shadow smaller:Live demo: http://dabblet.com/gist/a8f8ba527f5cff607327To not see any shadow on the sides, the (absolute value of the) spread radius (4th parameter) needs to be the same as the blur radius (3rd parameter).If you have a fixed color on the background, you can hide the side-shadow effect with two masking shadows having the same color of the background and blur = 0, example:Note that the black shadow must be the last, and has a negative spread (-3px) in order to prevent it from extendig beyond the corners.Here the fiddle (change the color of the masking shadows to see how it really works).It's always better to read the specs. There is no box-shadow-bottom property, and as Lea points out you should always place the un-prefixed property at the bottom, after the prefixed ones.So it's:I think this is what you're after?How about just using a containing div which has overflow set to hidden and some padding at the bottom? This seems like much the simplest solution.Sorry to say I didn't think of this myself but saw it somewhere else.As said by Jorgen Evens.You could also use clip-path to clip (hide) all overflowing edges but the one you want to show:See clip-path (MDN). The arguments to polygon are the top-left point, the top-right point, the bottom-right point, and the bottom-left point. By setting the bottom edge to 200% (or whatever number bigger than 100%) you constrain your overflow to only the bottom edge.I also needed a shadow but only under an image and set in slightly left and right. This worked for me:The element this is applied to is a page-wide image (980px x 300px).If it helps when fiddling with the settings, they run as follows:horizontal shadow, vertical shadow, blur distance, spread (i.e. shadow size), and color.It is better to look up shadow: this code is currently using on stackoverflow web.This code pen (not by me) demonstrates a super simple way of doing this and the other sides by themselves quite nicely: https://codepen.io/zeckdude/pen/oxywmmIf your background is solid (or you can reproduce it using CSS), you can use linear gradient that way:This will generate a 5px gradient at the bottom of the element, from black at 30% opacity to completely transparent. The rest of the element has white background. Of course, changing the last 2 color stops of the linear gradient, you could make the background completely transparent.You could also just do a gradient on the bottom - this was helpful for me because the shadow I wanted was on an element that was already semi-transparent, so I didn't have to worry about any clipping:Just make the \"bottom\" and \"height\" properties match and set your rgba values to whatever you want them to be at the top / bottom of the shadowYou can do that like this:General syntax:Example: we want to make only a bottom box shadow with red color, so to do that we have to set all the sides options where we have to set the bottom box shadow options and set all the others as empty as follow:update on someone else his answer transparant sides instead of white so it works on other color backgrounds too.inner shadow"},

If they are wide enough (width: 100%), they will force a line break.But that's ugly and not semantic. Instead, we could generate pseudo-elements inside the flex container, and use order to move them to the right places.But there is a limitation: the flex container can only have a ::before and a ::after pseudo-element. That means you can only force 2 line breaks.To solve that, you can generate the pseudo-elements inside the flex items instead of in the flex container. This way you won't be limited to 2. But those pseudo-elements won't be flex items, so they won't be able to force line breaks.But luckily, CSS Display L3 has introduced display: contents (currently only supported by Firefox 37):So you can apply display: contents to the children of the flex container, and wrap the contents of each one inside an additional wrapper. Then, the flex items will be those additional wrappers and the pseudo-elements of the children.Alternatively, according to Fragmenting Flex Layout and CSS Fragmentation, Flexbox allows forced breaks by using break-before, break-after or their CSS 2.1 aliases:Forced line breaks in flexbox are not widely supported yet, but it works on Firefox.From my perspective it is more semantic to use <hr> elements as line breaks between flex items.Tested in Chrome 66, Firefox 60 and Safari 11.@Oriol has an excellent answer, sadly as of October 2017, neither display:contents, neither page-break-after is widely supported, better said it's about Firefox which supports this but not the other players, I have come up with the following \"hack\" which I consider better than hard coding in a break after every 3rd element, because that will make it very difficult to make the page mobile friendly. As said it's a hack and the drawback is that you need to add quite a lot of extra elements for nothing, but it does the trick and works cross browser even on the dated IE11.The \"hack\" is to simply add an additional element after each div, which is set to display:none and then used the css nth-child to decide which one of this should be actually made visible forcing a line brake like this:You want a semantic linebreak?Then consider using <br>. W3Schools may suggest you that BR is just for writing poems (mine is coming soon) but you can change the style so it behaves as a 100% width block element that will push your content to the next line. If 'br' suggests a break then it seems more appropriate to me than using hr or a 100% div and makes the html more readable.Insert the <br> where you need linebreaks and style it like this. You can disable <br> with media queries, by setting display: to block or none as appropriate (I've included an example of this but left it commented out).You can use order: to set the order if needed too.And you can put as many as you want, with different classes or names :-)No need to limit yourself to what W3Schools says:I think the traditional way is flexible and fairly easy to understand:MarkupCreate grid.css file:I've created an example (jsfiddle)Try to resize the window under 400px, it's responsive!!Another possible solution that doesn't require to add any extra markup is to add some dynamic margin to separate the elements.In the case of the example, this can be done with the help of calc(), just adding margin-left and margin-right to the 3n+2 element (2, 5, 8)Snippet ExampleFor future questions, It's also possible to do it by using float property and clearing it in each 3 elements.Here's an example I've made.I tried several answers here, and none of them worked. Ironically, what did work was about the simplest alternative to a <br/> one could attempt:<div style=\"flex-basis: 100%;\"></div>or you could also do:<div style=\"width: 100%;\"></div>Place that wherever you want a new line. It seems to work even with adjacent <span>'s, but I'm using it with adjacent <div>'s.you could try wrapping the items in a dom element like here. with this you dont have to know a lot of css just having a good structure will solve the problem."},

Use tagNames in selectors only where you must!There are differences between #header .callout and #header.callout in css.Here is the \"plain English\" of #header .callout:\nSelect all elements with the class name callout that are descendants of the element with an ID of header.And #header.callout means:\nSelect the element which has an ID of header and also a class name of callout.You can read more here css tricksWell generally you shouldn't need to classify an element specified by id, because id is always unique, but if you really need to, the following should work:There's nothing wrong with combining an id and a class on one element, but you shouldn't need to identify it by both for one rule. If you really want to you can do:You don't need the div in front of the ID as others have suggested.In general, CSS rules specific to that element should be set with the ID, and those are going to carry a greater weight than those of just the class. Rules specified by the class would be properties that apply to multiple items that you don't want to change in multiple places anytime you need to adjust.That boils down to this:Make sense?You can combine ID and Class in CSS, but IDs are intended to be unique, so adding a class to a CSS selector would over-qualify it.use: tag.id ; tag#classin the tag variables in your css.Ids are supposed to be unique document wide, so you shouldn't have to select based on both.  You can assign an element multiple classes though with class=\"class1 class2\"I think you are all wrong.  IDs versus Class is not a question of specificity; they have completely different logical uses.IDs should be used to identify specific parts of a page:  the header, the nav bar, the main article, author attribution, footer.Classes should be used to apply styles to the page.  Let's say you have a general magazine site.  Every page on the site is going to have the same elements--header, nav, main article, sidebar, footer.  But your magazine has different sections--economics, sports, entertainment.  You want the three sections to have different looks--economics conservative and square, sports action-y, entertainment bright and young.You use classes for that.  You don't want to have to make multiple IDs--#economics-article and #sports-article and #entertainment-article.  That doesn't make sense.  Rather, you would define three classes, .economics, sports, and .entertainment, then define the #nav, #article, and #footer ids for each.Won't work when the doctype is html 4.01 though..."},

Can you save his sanity?In summary: How can a table's cells overflow evenly, and only when they've all given up all their whitespace?http://jsfiddle.net/7CURQ/I believe I have a non-javascript solution! Better late than never, right? After all this is an excellent question and Google is all over it. I didn't want to settle for a javascript fix because I find the slight jitter of things moving around after the page is loaded to be unacceptable.Features:How it works: Inside the table cell place two copies of the content in two different elements within a relatively-positioned container element. The spacer element is statically-positioned and as such will affect the width of the table cells. By allowing the contents of the spacer cell to wrap we can get the \"best-fit\" width of the table cells that we are looking for. This also allows us to use the absolutely-positioned element to restrict the width of the visible content to that of the relatively-positioned parent.Tested and working in: IE8, IE9, IE10, Chrome, Firefox, Safari, OperaResult Images:\nJSFiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/zAeA2/Sample HTML/CSS:I've been faced the same challenge few days ago. It seems Lucifer Sam found the best solution.But I noticed you should duplicate content at spacer element. Thought it's not so bad, but I'd like also to apply title popup for clipped text. And it means long text will appear third time in my code.Here I propose to access title attribute from :after pseudo-element to generate spacer and keep HTML clean.Works on IE8+, FF, Chrome, Safari, Operahttp://jsfiddle.net/feesler/HQU5J/If Javascript is acceptable, I put together a quick routine which you could use as a starting point.  It dynamically tries to adapt the cell widths using the inner width of a span, in reaction to window resize events.  Currently it assumes that each cell normally gets 50% of the row width, and it will collapse the right cell to keep the left cell at its maximum width to avoid overflowing.  You could implement much more complex width balancing logic, depending on your use cases. Hope this helps:Markup for the row I used for testing:JQuery which hooks up the resize event:There's a much easier and more elegant solution.Within the table-cell that you want to apply truncation, simply include a container div with css table-layout: fixed. This container takes the full width of the parent table cell, so it even acts responsive.Make sure to apply truncation to the elements in the table.Works from IE8+and css:here's a working Fiddle\nhttps://jsfiddle.net/d0xhz8tb/The problem is the 'table-layout:fixed' which create evenly-spaced-fixed-width columns. But disabling this css-property will kill the text-overflow because the table will become as large as possible (and than there is noting to overflow).I'm sorry but in this case Fred can't have his cake and eat it to.. unless the landlord gives Celldito less space to work with in the first place, Fred cannot use his..You could try to \"weight\" certain columns, like this:You can also try some more interesting tweaks, like using 0%-width columns and using some combination of the white-space CSS property.You get the idea.Yep I would say thirtydot has it, there is no way to do it unless you use a js method. You are talking about a complex set of rendering conditions that you will have to define. e.g. what happens when both cells are getting too big for their apartments you will have to decide who has priority or simply just give them a percentage of the area and if they are overfull they will both take up that area and only if one has whitespace will you stretch your legs in the other cell, either way there is no way to do it with css. Although there are some pretty funky things people do with css that I have not thought of. I really doubt you can do this though.Like samplebias answer, again if Javascript is an acceptable answer, I made a jQuery plugin specifically for this purpose: https://github.com/marcogrcr/jquery-tableoverflowTo use the plugin just typeFull example: http://jsfiddle.net/Cw7TD/3/embedded/result/Edits:Use some css hack, it seems the display: table-column; can come to rescue:JSFiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/blai/7u59asyp/This question pops up top in Google, so in my case, I used the css snippet\nfrom https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/truncate-string-with-ellipsis/ but applying it to the td did NOT give the desired result.I had to add a div tag around the text in the td and the ellipsis finally worked.Abbreviated HTML Code;Abbreviated CSS;Simply add the following rules to your td:Example:PS:\nIf you want to set a custom width to another td use property min-width.Check if \"nowrap\" solve the issue to an extent. Note: nowrap is not supported in HTML5you can set the width of right cell to minimum of required width, then apply overflow-hidden+text-overflow to the  inside of left cell, but Firefox is buggy here...although, seems, flexbox can helpI've been recently working on it. Check out this jsFiddle test, try it yourself changing the width of the base table to check the behavior).The solution is to embedded a table into another:Is Fred now happy with Celldito's expansion?Don't know if this will help anyone, but I solved a similar problem by specifying specific width sizes in percentage for each column. Obviously, this would work best if each column has content with width that doesn't vary too widely.I had the same issue, but I needed to display multiple lines (where text-overflow: ellipsis; fails). I solve it using a textarea inside a TD and then style it to behave like a table cell.Given that 'table-layout:fixed' is the essential layout requirement, that this creates evenly spaced non-adjustable columns, but that you need to make cells of different percentage widths, perhaps set the 'colspan' of your cells to a multiple?For example, using a total width of 100 for easy percentage calculations, and saying that you need one cell of 80% and another of 20%, consider:Of course, for columns of 80% and 20%, you could just set the 100% width cell colspan to 5, the 80% to 4, and the 20% to 1."},

If you have any sense ignore everything I suggest below.You could put a comment in the css before each colour in order to serve as a sort of variable, which you can change the value of using find/replace, so...At the top of the css fileLater in the CSS fileThen to, for example, change the colour scheme for the box text you do a find/replace on CSS itself doesn't use variables. However, you can use another language like SASS to define your styling using variables, and automatically produce CSS files, which you can then put up on the web. Note that you would have to re-run the generator every time you made a change to your CSS, but that isn't so hard.You can try CSS3 variables:There's no easy CSS only solution.  You could do this:Yeeeaaahhh.... you can now use var() function in CSS.....The good news is you can change it using JavaScript access, which will change globally as well... But how to declare them...It's quite simple:For example, you wanna assign a #ff0000 to a var(), just simply assign it in :root, also pay attention to --:The good things are the browser support is not bad, also don't need to be compiled to be used in the browser like LESS or SASS...Also, here is a simple JavaScript script, which changes the red value to blue:The 'Less' Ruby Gem for CSS looks awesome. http://lesscss.org/Yes, in near future (i write this in june 2012) you can define native css variables, without using less/sass etc ! The Webkit engine just implemented first css variable rules, so cutting edge versions of Chrome and Safari are already to work with them. See the Official Webkit (Chrome/Safari) development log  with a onsite css browser demo.Hopefully we can expect widespread browser support of native css variables in the next few months.Do not use css3 variables due to support. I would do the following if you want a pure css solution.You could pass the CSS through javascript and replace all instances of COLOUR1 with a certain color (basically regex it) and provide a backup stylesheet incase the end user has JS turned offI'm not clear on why you can't use PHP. You could then simply add and use variables as you wish, save the file as a PHP file and link to that .php file as the style sheet instead of the .css file.It doesn't have to be PHP, but you get what I mean.When we want programming stuff, why not use a programming language until CSS (maybe) supports things like variables?Also, check out Nicole Sullivan's Object-oriented CSS.dicejs.com (formally cssobjs) is a client-side version of SASS. You can set variables in your CSS (stored in json formatted CSS) and re-use your color variables.And here is a link to a complete downloadable demo which is a little more helpful then their documentation : dicejs demoConsider using SCSS. It's full compatible with CSS syntax, so a valid CSS file is also a valid SCSS file. This makes migration easy, just change the suffix. It has numerous enhancements, the most useful being variables and nested selectors.You need to run it through a pre-processor to convert it to CSS before shipping it to the client. I've been a hardcore CSS developer for many years now, but since forcing myself to do a project in SCSS, I now won't use anything else.If you have Ruby on your system you can do this:http://unixgods.org/~tilo/Ruby/Using_Variables_in_CSS_Files_with_Ruby_on_Rails.htmlThis was made for Rails, but see below for how to modify it to run it stand alone.You could use this method independently from Rails, by writing a small Ruby wrapper script \nwhich works in conjunction with site_settings.rb and takes your CSS-paths into account, and \nwhich you can call every time you want to re-generate your CSS (e.g. during site startup)You can run Ruby on pretty much any operating system, so this should be fairly platform independent.e.g. wrapper:  generate_CSS.rb  (run this script whenever you need to generate your CSS)the generate_CSS_files method in site_settings.rb then needs to be modified like this:You can group selectors:Sure can, sort of, thanks to the wonderful world of multiple classes, can do this:but I often end up combining them anyway like this:I know the semantic police will be all over you, but it works.Not PHP I'm afraid, but Zope and Plone use something similar to SASS called DTML to achieve this. It's incredibly useful in CMS's.Upfront Systems has a good example of its use in Plone.If you write the css file as an xsl template, you could read color values from a simple xml file. Then create the css with an xslt processor.colors.xml:styles.xsl:Command to render css: xsltproc -o styles.css styles.xsl colors.xmlstyles.css:It’s not possible with CSS alone.You can do it with JavaScript and LESS using less.js, which will render LESS variables into CSS live, but it’s for development only and adds too much overhead for real-life use.The closest you can come with CSS is to use an attribute substring selector like this:and set the ids of all your elements that you want to be adjusted to names starting with colvar-, such as colvar-header. Then when you change the color, all the ID styles are updated. That’s as close as you can get with CSS alone."},

Check out his guest post on Matt Snider's blog for the full details on how this works.Note this technique also prevents updating the content of the node in JavaScript using the innerHTML property in Firefox. See the end of this post for a workaround.CSSellipsis.xml file contentsUpdating node contentTo update the content of a node in a way that works in Firefox use the following:See Matt Snider's post for an explanation of how this works.2014 March: Truncating long strings with CSS: a new answer with focus on browser supportDemo on http://jsbin.com/leyukama/1/ (I use jsbin because it supports old version of IE).The -ms-text-overflow CSS property is not necessary: it is a synonym of the text-overflow CSS property, but versions of IE from 6 to 11 already support the text-overflow CSS property.Successfully tested (on Browserstack.com) on Windows OS, for web browsers:Firefox: as pointed out by Simon Lieschke (in another answer), Firefox only support the text-overflow CSS property from Firefox 7 onwards (released September 27th 2011).I double checked this behavior on Firefox 3.0 & Firefox 6.0 (text-overflow is not supported).Some further testing on a Mac OS web browsers would be needed.Note: you may want to show a tooltip on mouse hover when an ellipsis is applied, this can be done via javascript, see this questions: HTML text-overflow ellipsis detection and HTML - how can I show tooltip ONLY when ellipsis is activatedResources:If you're OK with a JavaScript solution, there's a jQuery plug-in to do this in a cross-browser fashion - see http://azgtech.wordpress.com/2009/07/26/text-overflow-ellipsis-for-firefox-via-jquery/OK, Firefox 7 implemented text-overflow: ellipsis as well as text-overflow: \"string\". Final release is planned for 2011-09-27. Another solution to the problem could be the following set of CSS rules:The only drawback with the above CSS is that it would add the \"...\" irrespective of whether the text-overflows the container or not. Still, if you have a case where you have a bunch of elements and are sure that content will overflow, this one would be a simpler set of rules.My two cents.

I came up with the following ideas:While the first idea would be pretty cool, I couldn't find a tool like this, whether for Mac nor for Windows. And I don't have any skills in programming such a thing myself.The second idea seems a bit clumsy, but it would achieve the desired effect, I think.Does anybody have another idea?I made a quick demo of something that you hopefully should be able to base your code on, using the Pointer Lock API.I forked this pointer-lock-demo repo and modified it to add a random movement element.Here is the link to my GitHub page: https://aristocrates.github.io/pointer-lock-demo\nAnd here is the link to my repo: https://github.com/aristocrates/pointer-lock-demoThe javascript code of importance is contained in app.js, in the canvasLoop(e) method.The only thing I changed from the original demo was after the linesI added two lines to represent random movement:There are still plenty of things you could improve, but hopefully this can help you get started.Actually, I like solutions, which may be based on javascript, since they are more likely web-related, and good chances are — OS-independent. However, I was thinking about — how to resolve your issue for all browsers, since javascript solutions, in this case, will be difficult to adjust for all possible browsers (I'm not sure if it's possible at all).So, as you've mentioned, there is another way — i.e. to emulate the behavior on OS level. This has another advantage too — you may be sure that for browser it looks 100% as it was human (because, well, it's driver which is sending the signal). So you may use driver/device-based solutions with any browsers (or even in situation, when javascript is disabled).Unfortunately, involving driver/device immediately causes OS dependency. So for each OS you'll need own solution. In this post I'm focused on Linux-based solution (so, will work with Linux) — and Mac OS a little. With Linux, it's possible to write events to device explicitly, so below is sample of function with main loop:My full code for the issue be found here. \nThe program will ask for amplitude of \"tremor\" and it's frequency (thus, how many time in micro-seconds are between \"tremors\"). To emulate situation, it will force mouse to move randomly for 0..X points in random direction (up-down-left-bottom) and wait randomly 0..Y micro-seconds till next \"tremor\", there X is amplitude of \"tremor\" and Y is frequency of \"tremor\"Another thing may be to adapt the program for your system. The program is \"dummy\" and can't detect mouse by itself, so \"/dev/input/event4\" is hard-coded. To realize what may be identifier for your system you may try:And so possibilities are \"event3\" and \"event4\" — but for your system that may have other values. So, if that is different from currently used in C code, just change the corresponding line (so, line with int  fd = open(\"/dev/input/event4\", O_RDWR); and place your device instead of event4)A gif demo for this program (low frame rate, unfortunately, so keep image not too large) here. A little side note (if you don't know what to do with C code) — to compile program above, just use:where file.c is the name of your C source code file, then you'll get executable, called m in your directory. Most likely you'll need permissions to write into mouse device directly, so you may use sudo:The logic will remain same:That's it. For instance, Mac OS has its own way to work with mouse (not like Linux, Mac hasn't procfs as well), it's well-described here. What is better — javascript or device-oriented solutions — is up to you, because certain condition (like cross-browser or cross-OS) may decide everything in this case. Therefore, I've provided guidelines together with certain working example of how to implement that on OS level. The benefit here is that solution is cross-browser, but as a cost we have OS-binded program. I did this as a joke once, on the Puppy Linux Forum and got the comment that:Here is the shell script which requires xdotoolName as parkinson_sim and run with optional argument for the time between tremors which can be 0.001 to 999.0. I made the mistake of clicking on it myself instead of running it from the command line and quickly discovered how frustrating it must be.  It took me several tries to get a terminal window open to kill it.Your second idea (hide the cursor) is halfway to one that I think may work well for you:Then, you add some tremor math to your cursor code, to \"shake\" the cursor. Up to you to determine what the right curves are to properly simulate tremor input.Finally: for whatever controls you are programming (links, etc.):One major bonus with this implementation: your 'shaky cursor' will be displayed on touch devices, which would not have a cursor to begin with.Based on Michael Theriot's (very clean and helpful!) base JSFiddle from the comments, here's one that tremors constantly with a normally-distributed sweep around the current cursor location: http://jsfiddle.net/benmosher/0x4mc64v/4/(The normal array is the result of calling rnorm(100) in my R console. Simplest way I could think of in JS to sample a normally-distributed random integer.)Just an idea for getting the tremor \"right\", you can record the mouse movement of a real patient, this makes it more authentic when you tell people where the data comes from.There a scripts for letting a cat follow your mouse cursor, you could adjust one to let a second cursor follow (jump around) your cursor. The page is calculating the position of the the second cursor, so it can also determine if an click event is successful or not.If you can, please make it web based, you will reach a lot more people this way than asking them to install a program or activate flash or whatever there is.Instead of trying to move the pointer, you could move the application (web page) instead. I wrote a simple html form that has some entry fields in it. When you move the mouse onto the form, the form moves.You can see a demo of the moving form at jsfiddle. Try to click on one of the input fields to see the effect.I used the jquery shake effect to achieve this. The javascript for the shake effect looks like this, and just causes the form to move up and down whenever the mouse is moved over it:Although the form only moves up and down, I think it has the desired effect. You can play with the parameters (direction, times, distance, as well as the un-named \"1000\" above) to tweak the form movement.Why not use a hardware solution? There are certain mice out there that you can put weights in, like the Logitech G500. Instead of putting in a weight, put in a small oscillating motor that makes the mouse shake slightly. This also simulated the actual disorder more: it's not just the cursor that shakes, but the entire hand and mouse. And it also means you can show other software than websites.Instead of a mouse with a weight slot, you can also just tape something to the mouse, but that's more noticeable.As you were thinking about doing it with a custom mouse driver I suppose a small program running on the PC would do either? If this is the case, here is a small snippet for C#, which infinitely moves the cursor randomly withing a range of plus minus 5px around the current cursor position. After each displacement the program waits 50 ms to 100 ms (not accurate!). The shakiness can be configured by adapting the values for the displacement and the pauses. I ran this in a console application and - depending on the values - it gave me quite a hard time stopping the program.Here is a windows version of my xdotool script that uses AutoIt. This was my first ever AutoIt script, and it took only a couple of minutes to write, so I'm sure it can be improved.  Just save with the extension .au3 and run it with AutoIt (Run Script x86).ControlsOr use my compiled version from here.You can't expect anyone to be able to hold their hands perfectly steady, so one thing you can consider is, My reasoning is (caveat, I am not an expert in ux or medicine) by making the click-able elements smaller, you creates a similar problem for most people that a person afflicted with Parkinson's disease would face with an everyday web site. You can use an old-age simulation suit, such as the one described in this article... I suspect the hand-tremors part is just a vibrating motor strapped around the wrist, plus some thick gloves to make the hands generally clumsy.Note: The script cannot know if the hand is still on the mouse ;)The low-level parts of simulating the tremor are well answered by now. I will add something focusing on the kind of tremor to simulate:Most answers implement a mouse cursor that is moving on a random path with some fixed maximal step width in X and Y direction.This should work well enough for the use case of making it hard to hit a specific area like a button.    For the more general issue of simulating UI problems caused by a tremor from Parkinson's disease, it would be at least interesting to actually simulate the hand movements of this kind of tremor.\nI suspect the random walk may not be a very good approximation.It may be hard to get hold of real hand trace data of tremor movement of course, but there are certainly papers about analyzing this kind of tremor:The paper Parametric Representation of Hand Movement in Parkinson’s Disease is about how to best plot 3D hand movement traces.\nThe paper is paywalled, but the preview on the top right, labeled \"Look Inside >\" on the book image, shows some interesting plots of different representations of hand trace data."},

Without border-box, you would also have to subtract paddings and borders, making this solution a mess.Note: It is encouraged to hide horizontal overflow of your scrolling container, as certain browsers may choose to display a horizontal scrollbar despite there being no overflow.I've searched far and wide for a solution to this problem for a long time. Ideally we want to have the child greater than the parent, but without knowing the constraints of the parent in advance.And I finally found a brilliant generic answer here.\nCopying it verbatim:Based on your suggestion original suggestion (setting negative margins), I have tried and come up with a similar method using percentage units for dynamic browser width:HTMLCSS:The negative margins will let the content flow out of the Parent DIV. Therefore I set the padding: 0 100%; to push the content back to the original boundaries of the Chlid DIV.The negative margins will also make the .child-div's total width expands out of the browser's viewport, resulting in a horizontal scroll. Hence we need to clip the extruding width by applying an overflow-x: hidden to a Grandparent DIV (which is the parent of the Parent Div):Here is the JSfiddleI haved tried Nils Kaspersson's left: calc(-50vw + 50%); it worked perfectly fine in Chrome & FF (not sure about IE yet) until I found out Safari browsers doesn't do it properly. Hope they fixed this soon as I actually like this simple method.This also may resolve your issue where the Parent DIV element has to be position:relativeThe 2 drawbacks of this workaround method is:Please let me know if there's any issue you find with this method ;). Hope it helps.I used this:HTMLCSSFlexbox can be used to make a child wider than its parent with three lines of CSS.Only the child’s display, margin-left and width need to be set. margin-left depends on the child’s width. The formula is:CSS variables can be used to avoid manually calculating the left margin.Demo #1: Manual calculationDemo #2: Using CSS variablesyou can try position: absolute. and give width and height , top: 'y axis from the top' \nand left: 'x-axis'I had a similar issue.\nThe content of the child element was supposed to stay in the parent element while the background had to extend the full viewport width.I resolved this issue by making the child element position: relative and adding a pseudo element (:before) to it with position: absolute; top: 0; bottom: 0; width: 4000px; left: -1000px;.\nThe pseudo element stays behind the actual child as a pseudo background element. This works in all browsers (even IE8+ and Safari 6+ - don't have the possibility to test older versions).Small example fiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/vccv39j9/Adding to Nils Kaspersson's solution, I am resolving for the width of the vertical scrollbar as well. I am using 16px as an example, which is subtracted from the view-port width. This will avoid the horizontal scrollbar from appearing.Assuming the parent has a fixed width, e.g #page { width: 1000px; } and is centered #page { margin: auto; }, you want the child to fit the width of browser viewport you could simply do:To make child div as wide as the content, try this:I know this is old but for anyone coming to this for an answer you would do it like so:Overflow hidden on a element containing the parent element, such as the body.

That is, I don't want the click event to be triggered on the blue bit.This is not possible; pseudo-elements are not part of the DOM at all so you can't bind any events directly to them, you can only bind to their parent elements.If you must have a click handler on the red region only, you have to make a child element, like a span, place it right after the opening <p> tag, apply styles to p span instead of p:before, and bind to it.Actually, it is possible.

This worked for me on my absolutely-positioned :afterThanks to this article, I realized (with jQuery) I can use e.pageY and e.pageX instead of worrying about e.offsetY/X and e.clientY/X issue between browsers.I liked this event.pageY idea because it would always be the same, as it was relative to the document. I can compare it to my :after's parent element using offset(), which returns its X and Y also relative to the document. Therefore, I can come up with a range of \"clickable\" region on the entire page that never changes.Here's my demo on codepen.or if too lazy for codepen, here's the JS:* I only cared about the Y values for my example.Short Answer:I did it. \nI wrote a function for dynamic usage for all the little people out there... Working example which displays on the pageWorking example logging to the consoleLong Answer:...Still did it.It took me awhile to do it, since a psuedo element is not really on the page. While some of the answers above work in SOME scenarios, they ALL fail to be both dynamic and work in a scenario in which an element is both unexpected in size and position(such as absolute positioned elements overlaying a portion of the parent element). Mine does not. Usage:How it works:It grabs the height, width, top, and left positions(based on the position away from the edge of the window) of the parent element and grabs the height, width, top, and left positions(based on the edge of the parent container) and compares those values to determine where the psuedo element is on the screen.It then compares where the mouse is. As long as the mouse is in the newly created variable range then it returns true.Note:It is wise to make the parent element RELATIVE positioned. If you have an absolute positioned psuedo element, this function will only work if it is positioned based on the parent's dimensions(so the parent has to be relative...maybe sticky or fixed would work too....I dont know).Code:Support:I dont know....it looks like ie is dumb and likes to return auto as a computed value sometimes. IT SEEMS TO WORK WELL IN ALL BROWSERS IF DIMENSIONS ARE SET IN CSS. So...set your height and width on your psuedo elements and only move them with top and left. I recommend using it on things that you are okay with it not working on. Like an animation or something. Chrome works...as usual.This works for me:Add condition in Click event to restrict the clickable area . None of these answers are reliable, and mine wont be much more reliable. Caveats aside, if you do get into the lucky scenario where the element you're trying to have clicked doesn't have padding (such that all of the \"inner\" space of the element is completely covered by sub-elements), then you can check the target of the click event against the container itself. If it matches, that means you've clicked a :before or :after element.Obviously this would not be feasible with both types (before and after) however I have implemented it as a hack/speed fix and it is working very well, without a bunch of position checking, which may be inaccurate depending on about a million different factors.Shortest example of code:pointer-events control detection of events, removing receiving events from target, but keep receiving from pseudo-elements make possible to click on ::before and ::after and you will always know what you are clicking on pseudo-element, however if you still need to click, you put all content in nested element (span in example), but because we don't want to apply any additional styles, display: contents; become very handy solution and it supported by most browsers. pointer-events: none; as already mentioned in original post also widely supported.The JavaScript part also used widely supported Array.from and for...of, however they are not necessary to use in code.

What would be the proper way to do it?The floated elements do not add to the height of the container element, and hence if you don't clear them, container height won't increase...I'll show you visually:More Explanation:You can also add overflow: hidden; on container elements, but I would suggest you use clear: both; instead.Also if you might like to self-clear an element you can useTaking a case as an example to explain how CSS floats work, assuming we need a simple 2 column layout with a header, footer, and 2 columns, so here is what the blueprint looks like...In the above example, we will be floating only the red boxes, either you can float both to the left, or you can float on to left, and another to right as well, depends on the layout, if it's 3 columns, you may float 2 columns to left where another one to the right so depends, though in this example, we have a simplified 2 column layout so will float one to left and the other to the right.Markup and styles for creating the layout explained further down...Let's go step by step with the layout and see how float works.. First of all, we use the main wrapper element, you can just assume that it's your viewport, then we use header and assign a height of 50px so nothing fancy there. It's just a normal non floated block level element which will take up 100% horizontal space unless it's floated or we assign inline-block to it.The first valid value for float is left so in our example, we use float: left; for .floated_left, so we intend to float a block to the left of our container element.Column floated to the leftAnd yes, if you see, the parent element, which is .wrapper is collapsed, the one you see with a green border didn't expand, but it should right? Will come back to that in a while, for now, we have got a column floated to left.Coming to the second column, lets it float this one to the rightAnother column floated to the rightHere, we have a 300px wide column which we float to the right, which will sit beside the first column as it's floated to the left, and since it's floated to the left, it created empty gutter to the right, and since there was ample of space on the right, our right floated element sat perfectly beside the left one.Still, the parent element is collapsed, well, let's fix that now. There are many ways to prevent the parent element from getting collapsed.Add, <div style=\"clear: both;\"></div> before the .wrapper div ends, likeDemoWell, that fixes very well, no collapsed parent anymore, but it adds unnecessary markup to the DOM, so some suggest, to use overflow: hidden; on the parent element holding floated child elements which work as intended.Use overflow: hidden; on .wrapperDemoThat saves us an element every time we need to clear float but as I tested various cases with this, it failed in one particular one, which uses box-shadow on the child elements.Demo (Can't see the shadow on all 4 sides, overflow: hidden; causes this issue)So what now? Save an element, no overflow: hidden; so go for a clear fix hack, use the below snippet in your CSS, and just as you use overflow: hidden; for the parent element, call the class below on the parent element to self-clear.DemoHere, shadow works as intended, also, it self-clears the parent element which prevents to collapse.And lastly, we use footer after we clear the floated elements.DemoWhen is float: none; used anyways, as it is the default, so any use to declare float: none;?Well, it depends, if you are going for a responsive design, you will use this value a lot of times, when you want your floated elements to render one below another at a certain resolution. For that float: none; property plays an important role there.Few real-world examples of how float is useful.Demo (Without floating img)Demo 2 (img floated to the left)Last but not the least, I want to explain this particular case where you float only single element to the left but you do not float the other, so what happens?Suppose if we remove float: right; from our .floated_right class, the div will be rendered from extreme left as it isn't floated.DemoSo in this case, either you can float the to the left as well OR You can use margin-left which will be equal to the size of the left floated column i.e 200px wide.You need to add overflow:auto to your parent div for it to encompass the inner floated div:jsFiddle exampleYou are encountering the float bug (though I'm not sure if it's technically a bug due to how many browsers exhibit this behaviour).  Here is what is happening:Under normal circumstances, assuming that no explicit height has been set, a block level element such as a div will set its height based on its content.  The bottom of the parent div will extend beyond the last element.  Unfortunately, floating an element stops the parent from taking the floated element into account when determining its height.  This means that if your last element is floated, it will not \"stretch\" the parent in the same way a normal element would.ClearingThere are two common ways to fix this.  The first is to add a \"clearing\" element; that is, another element below the floated one that will force the parent to stretch.  So add the following html as the last child:It shouldn't be visible, and by using clear:both, you make sure that it won't sit next to the floated element, but after it.Overflow:The second method, which is preferred by most people (I think) is to change the CSS of the parent element so that the overflow is anything but \"visible\".  So setting the overflow to \"hidden\" will force the parent to stretch beyond the bottom of the floated child.  This is only true if you haven't set a height on the parent, of course.Like I said, the second method is preferred as it doesn't require you to go and add semantically meaningless elements to your markup, but there are times when you need the overflow to be visible, in which case adding a clearing element is more than acceptable.Its because of the float of the div. Add overflow: hidden on the outside element.DemoYou confuse how browsers renders the elements when there are floating elements. If one block element is floating (your inner div in your case), other block elements will ignore it because browser removes floating elements from the normal flow of the web page. Then, because the floated div has been removed from the normal flow, the outside div is filled in, like the inner div isn't there. However, inline elements (images, links, text, blackquotes) will respect the boundaries of the floating element. If you introduce text in the outside div, the text will place arround de inner div.In other words, block elements (headers, paragraphs, divs, etc) ignore floating elements and fill in, and inline elements (images, links, text, etc) respect boundaries of floating elements.An fiddle example hereyou can use overflow property to the container div if you don't have any div to show over the container eg:Here is the following css:-----------------------OR------------------------------Here is the following css:Try this one"},

But instead of using javascript to modify the parent, I think I'll dynamically add a CSS class to the parent and CSS-selectively show the children accordingly. This will maintain the decisions in the logic and not based on a CSS state. tl;dr; apply the a and b styles to the parent <div>, not the child (of course, not everyone will be able to do this. i.e. Angular components making decisions of their own).In my case, I had to change the cell padding of an element that contained an input checkbox for a table that's being dynamically rendered with DataTables: After implementing the following line code within the initComplete function I was able to produce the correct padding, which fixed the rows from being displayed with an abnormally large heightNow, you can see that the correct styles are being applied to the parent element: Essentially, this answer is an extension of @KP's answer, but the more collaboration of implementing this the better.

No need for jQuery.\nIt won't show a tooltip, instead it'll just expand the content to its full length on mouseover.Works great if you have content that gets replaced. Then you don't have to run a jQuery function every time.uosɐſ's answer is fundamentally correct, but you probably don't want to do it in the mouseenter event. That's going to cause it to do the calculation to determine if it's needed, each time you mouse over the element. Unless the size of the element is changing, there's no reason to do that.It would be better to just call this code immediately after the element is added to the DOM:Or, if you don't know when exactly it's added, then call that code after the page is finished loading.if you have more than a single element that you need to do this with, then you can give them all the same class (such as \"mightOverflow\"), and use this code to update them all:Here is my jQuery plugin:Usage:Edit:I have made a gist for this plugin.\nhttps://gist.github.com/UziTech/d45102cdffb1039d4415Here are two other pure CSS solutions:We need to detect whether ellipsis is really applied, then to show a tooltip to reveal full text. It is not enough by only comparing \"this.offsetWidth < this.scrollWidth\" when the element nearly holding its content but only lacking one or two more pixels in width, especially for the text of full-width Chinese/Japanese/Korean characters.Here is an example: http://jsfiddle.net/28r5D/5/I found a way to improve ellipsis detection:Here is my improvement: http://jsfiddle.net/28r5D/6/I created a jQuery plugin that uses Bootstrap's tooltip instead of the browser's build-in tooltip. Please note that this has not been tested with older browser.JSFiddle: https://jsfiddle.net/0bhsoavy/4/This is what I did.  Most tooltip scripts require you to execute a function that stores the tooltips.  This is a jQuery example:If you didn't want to check for ellipsis css, you could simplify like:I have the \"when\" around it, so that the \"setupTooltip\" function doesn't execute until all titles have been updated.  Replace the \"setupTooltip\", with your tooltip function and the * with the elements you want to check.  * will go through them all if you leave it.If you simply want to just update the title attributes with the browsers tooltip, you can simplify like:Or without check for ellipsis:If you want to do this solely using javascript, I would do the following. Give the span an id attribute (so that it can easily be retrieved from the DOM) and place all the content in an attribute named 'content':Then, in your javascript, you can do the following after the element has been inserted into the DOM.Of course, if you're using javascript to insert the span into the DOM, you could just keep the content in a variable before inserting it. This way you don't need a content attribute on the span.There are more elegant solutions than this if you want to use jQuery.I have CSS class, which determines where to put ellipsis. Based on that, I do the following (element set could be different, i write those, where ellipsis is used, of course it could be a separate class selector):Here's a Vanilla JavaScript solution:None of the solutions above worked for me, but I figured out a great solution. The biggest mistake people are making is having all the 3 CSS properties declared on the element upon pageload. You have to add those styles+tooltip dynamically IF and ONLY IF the span you want an ellipses on is wider than its parent.You could possibly surround the span with another span, then simply test if the width of the original/inner span is greater than that of the new/outer span.  Note that I say possibly -- it is roughly based on my situation where I had a span inside of a td so I don't actually know that if it will work with a span inside of a span.  Here though is my code for others who may find themselves in a position similar to mine; I'm copying/pasting it without modification even though it is in an Angular context, I don't think that detracts from the readability and the essential concept.  I coded it as a service method because I needed to apply it in more than one place.  The selector I've been passing in has been a class selector that will match multiple instances.This was my solution, works as a charm!"},

You need to specify the width of the container you are centering (not the parent width).Complete rule for CSS:Off the top of my head, if the element is not a block element - make it so.and then give it a width.Off the top of my cat's head, make sure the div you're trying to center is not set to width: 100%.If it is, then the rules set on the child divs are what will matter.Please go to this quick example I've created jsFiddle. Hopefull it's easy to understand. You can use a wrapper div with the width of the site to center align.

(I know this post is 5 years old, but it's still relevant to passers-by ;)Here is my Suggestion:It's perhaps interesting that you do not have to specify width for a <button> element to make it work - just make sure it has display:block : http://jsfiddle.net/muhuyttr/For anybody just now hitting this question, and not being able to fix margin: 0 auto, here's something I discovered you may find useful: a table element with no specified width must have display: table and not display: block in order for margin: auto to do work. This may be obvious to some, as the combination of display: block and the default width value will give a table which expands to fill its container, but if you want the table to take it's \"natural\" width and be centered, you need display: table"},

How would I go bout creating this.This might help you:[EDIT], to match the comment...whenever content is added, call the function updateScroll(), or set a timer:if you want to update ONLY if the user didn't move:I just implemented this and perhaps you can use my approach.Say we have the following HTML:Then we can check if it scrolled to the bottom with:scrollHeight gives you the height of the element, including any non visible area due to overflow. clientHeight gives you the CSS height or said in another way, the actual height of the element. Both methods returns the height without margin, so you needn't worry about that. scrollTop gives you the position of the vertical scroll. 0 is top and max is the scrollHeight of the element minus the element height itself. When using the scrollbar it can be difficult (it was in Chrome for me) to get the scrollbar all the way down to the bottom. so I threw in a 1px inaccuracy. So isScrolledToBottom will be true even if the scrollbar is 1px from the bottom. You can set this to whatever feels right to you.Then it's simply a matter of setting the scrollTop of the element to the bottom.I have made a fiddle for you to show the concept: http://jsfiddle.net/dotnetCarpenter/KpM5j/EDIT:\nAdded code snippet to clarify when isScrolledToBottom is true.Stick scrollbar to bottom\nI was able to get this working with CSS only.The trick is to use display: flex; and flex-direction: column-reverse;The browser treats the bottom like its the top. Assuming the browsers you're targeting support flex-box, the only caveat is that the markup has to be in reverse order.Here is a working example. https://codepen.io/jimbol/pen/YVJzBgLive demo: http://jsfiddle.net/KGfG2/Default overflow is scroll from top to bottom.transform: rotate(180deg) can make it scroll or load dynamic block from bottom to top. https://blog.csdn.net/yeshennet/article/details/88880252This will calculate the ScrollTop Position from the height of #yourDivID using the $(document).height() property so that even if dynamic contents are added to the div the scroller will always be at the bottom position. Hope this helps. But it also has a small bug even if we scroll up and leaves the mouse pointer from the scroller it will automatically come to the bottom position. If somebody could correct that also it will be nice.Here is my version based on dotnetCarpenter's answer. My approach is a pure jQuery and I named the variables to make things a bit clearer.. What is happening is if the content height is greater then the container we scroll the extra distance down to achieve the desired result. Works in IE and chrome..Jim Hall's answer is preferrable because while it indeed does not scroll to the bottom when you're scrolled up, it is also pure CSS.Very much unfortunately however, this is not a stable solution: In chrome (possibly due to the 1-px-issue described by dotnetCarpenter above), scrollTop behaves inaccurately by 1 pixel, even without user interaction (upon element add). You can set scrollTop = scrollHeight - clientHeight, but that will keep the div in position when another element is added, aka the \"keep itself at bottom\" feature is not working anymore.So, in short, adding a small amount of Javascript (sigh) will fix this and fulfill all requirements:Something like https://codepen.io/anon/pen/pdrLEZ this (example by Coo), and after adding an element to the list, also the following:where 29 is the height of one line.So, when the user scrolls up half a line (if that is even possible?), the Javascript will ignore it and scroll to the bottom. But I guess this is neglectible. And, it fixes the Chrome 1 px thingy.Here's a solution based on a blog post by Ryan Hunt. It depends on the overflow-anchor CSS property, which pins the scrolling position to an element at the bottom of the scrolled content.Note that overflow-anchor doesn't currently work in Safari or Edge, so this solution doesn't currently work in all browsers.Here is how I approached it. My div height is 650px. I decided that if the scroll height is within 150px of the bottom then auto scroll it.

It helped me.See also Get Styles.Cross-browser solution to checking CSS values without DOM manipulation:Usage:Sanitized version (forces selector input to lowercase, and allows for use case without leading \".\")If you set it programmatically you can just call it like a variable (i.e. document.getElementById('image_1').style.top). Otherwise, you can always use jQuery:If you're into libraries, why not MyLibrary and getStyle.The jQuery css method is misnamed, CSS is just one way of setting styles and doesn't necessarily represent the actual values of an element's style properties.As a matter of safety, you may wish to check that the element exists before you attempt to read from it. If it doesn't exist, your code will throw an exception, which will stop execution on the rest of your JavaScript and potentially display an error message to the user -- not good. You want to be able to fail gracefully.In 2019You can use computedStyleMap()The answer is valid but sometimes you need to check what unit it returns, you can get that without any slice() or substring() string.The cross-browser solution without DOM manipulation given above does not work because it gives the first matching rule, not the last.

Use this CSS:Plus either this JS (without jQuery)...Or this JS with jQuery...... or equivalent code using whatever other library or framework you're working with.This is actually a fairly subtle problem.First up, you probably want to create a 'notransition' class that you can apply to elements to set their *-transition CSS attributes to none. For instance:(Minor aside - note the lack of an -ms-transition in there. You don't need it. The first version of Internet Explorer to support transitions at all was IE 10, which supported them unprefixed.)But that's just style, and is the easy bit. When you come to try and use this class, you'll run into a trap. The trap is that code like this won't work the way you might naively expect:Naively, you might think that the change in height won't be animated, because it happens while the 'notransition' class is applied. In reality, though, it will be animated, at least in all modern browsers I've tried. The problem is that the browser is caching the styling changes that it needs to make until the JavaScript has finished executing, and then making all the changes in a single reflow. As a result, it does a reflow where there is no net change to whether or not transitions are enabled, but there is a net change to the height. Consequently, it animates the height change.You might think a reasonable and clean way to get around this would be to wrap the removal of the 'notransition' class in a 1ms timeout, like this:but this doesn't reliably work either. I wasn't able to make the above code break in WebKit browsers, but on Firefox (on both slow and fast machines) you'll sometimes (seemingly at random) get the same behaviour as using the naive approach. I guess the reason for this is that it's possible for the JavaScript execution to be slow enough that the timeout function is waiting to execute by the time the browser is idle and would otherwise be thinking about doing an opportunistic reflow, and if that scenario happens, Firefox executes the queued function before the reflow.The only solution I've found to the problem is to force a reflow of the element, flushing the CSS changes made to it, before removing the 'notransition' class. There are various ways to do this - see here for some. The closest thing there is to a 'standard' way of doing this is to read the offsetHeight property of the element.One solution that actually works, then, isHere's a JS fiddle that illustrates the three possible approaches I've described here (both the one successful approach and the two unsuccessful ones):\nhttp://jsfiddle.net/2uVAA/131/Add an additional CSS class that blocks the transition, and then remove it to return to the previous state. This make both CSS and JQuery code short, simple and well understandable.CSS:!important was added to be sure that this rule will have more \"weight\", because ID is normally more specific than class.JQuery:I would advocate disabling animation as suggested by DaneSoul, but making the switch global:.notransition can be then applied to the body element, effectively overriding any transition animation on the page:For a pure JS solution (no CSS classes), just set the transition to 'none'. To restore the transition as specified in the CSS, set the transition to an empty string.If you're using vendor prefixes, you'll need to set those too.You can disable animation, transition, trasforms for all of element in page with this css codeI think you could create a separate css class that you can use in these cases:Then in jQuery you would toggle the class like so:If you want to remove CSS transitions, transformations and animations from the current webpage you can just execute this little script I wrote (inside your browsers console):It uses vanillaJS to load this css-file. Heres also a github repo in case you want to use this in the context of a scraper (Ruby-Selenium): remove-CSS-animations-repodoes in your js kill it?obviously repeat for each.I'd have a class in your CSS like this:and then in your jQuery:"},

Obviously automatically through bootstrap the div sizes would become 450px each to compensate for the spaceYou can achieve spacing between columns using the col-md-offset-* classes, documented here. The spacing is consistent so that all of your columns line up correctly. To get even spacing and column size I would do the following:I was facing the same issue; and the following worked well for me. Hope this helps someone landing here:This will automatically render some space between the 2 divs. I know I'm late to the party, but you could try spacing the boxes with padding.CSS:Have a go at ityou can use background-clip and box-model with border propretyI have had similar issues with space between columns. The root problem is that columns in bootstrap 3 and 4 use padding instead of margin. So background colors for two adjacent columns touch each other.I found a solution that fit our problem and will most likely work for most people trying to space columns and maintain the same gutter widths as the rest of the grid system.This was the end result we were going forHaving the gap with a drop shadow between columns was problematic. We did not want extra space between columns. We just wanted the gutters to be \"transparent\" so the background color of the site would appear between two white columns.this is the markup for the two columnsCSSThis approach does require an inner div with negative margins just like the \"row\" class bootstrap uses. And this div, we called it \"raised-block\", must be the direct sibling of a columnThis way you still get proper padding inside your columns. I have seen solutions that appear to work by creating space, but unfortunately the columns they create have extra padding on either side of the row so it ends up making the row thinner that the grid layout was designed for. If you look at the image for the desired look, this would mean the two columns together would be smaller than the one larger one on top which breaks the natural structure of the grid.The major drawback to this approach is that it requires extra markup wrapping the content of each columns. For us this works because only specific columns needed space between them to achieve the desired look.This will allow a space between the two columns and obviously if you want to change the default width you can go for mixins to modify the default bootstrap width. Or, you can give the width using the inline CSS style.You can achieve spacing between columns using the col-xs-* classes,within in a  col-xs-* div coded below. The spacing is consistent so that all of your columns line up correctly. To get even spacing and column size I would do the following:Use bootstrap's .form-group class. Like this in your case:Inside the col-md-?, create another div and put picture in that div, than you can easily add padding like so.Bootstrap 4, file custom.scss you can add following code:by default $grid-gutter-width-base: 30px;I had to figure out how to do this for 3 columns.  I wanted to round the corners of the divs and couldn't get the spacing to work.  I used margins.  In my case I figured for 90% of the screen to be filled in by the divs and 10% for margins:html:and CSS: To make it resize correctly for mobile devices, I had the CSS change the width from 30% to width:92.5%; under @media (max-width:1023px)Since you're using bootstrap, I guess you want to make the thing responsive. In that case you should'n use fixed sizes, in 'px' for example.As a workaround to other solutions, I propose make both columns \"col-md-5\" instead of \"col-md-6\", and then in the parent element \"row\" that contains the columns, add the class \"justify-content-between\", which puts the free space in the middle, as you can check in the bootstrap doc here This solution is also valid for more than two columns adjusting the \"col-md-x\" of coursehope it helps ;)According to Bootstrap 4 documentation you should give the parent a negative margin mx-n*, and the children a positive padding px-*I know this post is a little dated but I ran in to this same problem. Example of my html.In order to create space between the groups I overrode bootstrap's margin of -15px in my site.css file by reducing the negative margin by 5. Here's what I did...I hope this helps somebody else.I needed one column on mobile and two columns from tablet portrait up, with equal spacing between them in the middle (also without any grid-added padding inside columns). Could be achieved using spacing utilities and omitting the number in col-md:How about just adding a border the same color as the background using css? I'm new to this, so maybe there's a good reason not to, but it looked good when I tried it.it's simple .. you have to add solid border right, left to col-* \nand it should be work ..:)it looks like this : http://i.stack.imgur.com/CF5ZV.pngHTML :CSS :To obtain a particular width of spacing between columns, we have to set up padding in the standard Bootstrap's layout.This will be useful..If use want to increase or decrease further margin in right side of the box then simply edit margin-right property of list-item.sample output Just white border around wrap elementand first+last child no borderThis by default provides some padding inside the outer div the way you seem to need. Moreover you can also modify the padding using custom CSS.Simple WayDocumentation says (here):So the right answer is: set cols' padding-left/right equal to minus your row's margin-left/right.

Chrome now allows you to add local folders to your Workspace. After allowing Chrome access to the folder and adding the folder to the local workspace, you can map a web resource to a local resource.p.s.You may have to open the mapped file(s) and start editing to get Chrome apply the local version (date 201604.12).DevTools tech writer and developer advocate here.Starting in Chrome 65, Local Overrides is a new, lightweight way to do this. This is a different feature than Workspaces. When you make a change in DevTools, DevTools saves the change to a modified copy of the file on your computer. When you reload the page, DevTools serves the modified file, rather than the network resource.Workspaces is designed to let you use DevTools as your IDE. It maps your repository code to the network code, using source maps. The real benefit is if you're minifying your code, or using code that needs to get transpiled, like SCSS, then the changes you make in DevTools (usually) get mapped back into your original source code. Overrides, on the other hand, let you modify and save any file on the web. It's a good solution if you just want to quickly experiment with changes, and save those changes across page loads.New versions of Chrome have a feature called workspaces which addresses this issue. You can define which paths on your webserver correspond to which paths on your system, then edit and save with just ctrl-s.See: http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/developertools/revolutions2013/I know it is an old post, but I save it this way :You can also see Local Modifications to see your revisions, very interesting feature.\nAlso work with scripts.You're looking in the wrong section of \"Resources\".It's not under \"Local Storage\", it's under \"Frames\":The above screenshot shows a diff of the original styles against the new modifications made in the devtools.

Talk about bi-directional editing! :)Tin.cr WebsiteChrome Web Store LinkAndy's Blog ArticleNow that Chrome 18 was released last week with the required APIs, I published my chrome extension in the Chrome web store. The extension automatically saves changes in CSS or JS in Developer tools into the local disk. Go check it out.FYI, If you're using inline styles or modifying the DOM directly (for instance adding an element), workspaces don't solve this problem. That's because the DOM is living in memory and there's not an actual file associated with the active state of the DOM.For that, I like to take a \"before\" and \"after\" snapshot of the dom from the console: \ncopy(document.getElementsByTagName('html')[0].outerHTML)Then I place it in a diff tool to see my changes.Full article: https://medium.com/@theroccob/get-code-out-of-chrome-devtools-and-into-your-editor-defaf5651b4aTo answer the last part of your question about any extensions that can save changes, there is hotfixIt allows you to save changes from Chrome Dev Tools directly to GitHub. From there you can set up a post-receive hook on GitHub to automatically update your website. You can just right-click on your HTML element, click Edit as HTML and then copy and paste the HTML with the inline styles.UPDATE 2019: As other answers are bit outdated, I'll add updated one here. In latest version there's no need to map the chrome folder to filesystem.So, suppose I have a web folder containing HTML,CSS,JS files in desktop which i want to be updated when I make changes in chrome:=1) You'd need a running local server like node etc, alternatively this vscode extension creates the server for you: live server VSCode extension, install it, run the server.2) load the html page in chrome from running local server.3) Open devTools->Sources->Filesystem->Add folder to workspace4) Add the folder which is used in running local server. No additional mapping is required in latest chrome!

It therefore has two states (visible and hidden), which are opposite to each other.The display property, however, decides what layout rules an element will follow. There are several different kinds of rules for how elements will lay themselves out in CSS, so there are several different values  (block, inline, inline-block etc — see the documentation for these values here ).display:none removes an element from the page layout entirely, as if it wasn’t there.All other values for display cause the element to be a part of the page, so in a sense they’re all opposite to display:none.But there isn’t one value that’s the direct converse of display:none - just like there's no one hair style that's the opposite of \"bald\".A true opposite to display: none there is not (yet).But display: unset is very close and works in most cases.From MDN (Mozilla Developer Network):Note also that display: revert is currently being developed.  See MDN for details.When changing element's display in Javascript, in many cases a suitable option to 'undo' the result of element.style.display = \"none\" is element.style.display = \"\". This removes the display declaration from the style attribute, reverting the actual value of display property to the value set in the stylesheet for the document (to the browser default if not redefined elsewhere). But the more reliable approach is to have a class in CSS likeand adding/removing this class name to/from element.className.you can use It works as normal.... Its a small hacking in css ;)I use\ndisplay:block;\nIt works for meLike Paul explains there is no literal opposite of display: none in HTML as each element has a different default display and you can also change the display with a class or inline style etc.However if you use something like jQuery, their show and hide functions behave as if there was an opposite of display none. When you hide, and then show an element again, it will display in exactly the same manner it did before it was hidden. They do this by storing the old value of the display property on hiding of the element so that when you show it again it will display in the same way it did before you hid it.\nhttps://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/740e190223d19a114d5373758127285d14d6b71e/src/css.js#L180This means that if you set a div for example to display inline, or inline-block and you hide it and then show it again, it will once again show as display inline or inline-block same as it was beforescript:Notice that the display property of the div will remain constant even after it was hidden (display:none) and shown again.In the case of a printer friendly stylesheet, I use the following:I used this when I needed to print a form containing values and the input fields were difficult to print.  So I added the values wrapped in a span.print_only tag (div.print_only was used elsewhere) and then applied the .no_print class to the input fields.  So on-screen you would see the input fields and when printed, only the values.  If you wanted to get fancy you could use JS to update the values in the span tags when the fields were updated but that wasn't necessary in my case.  Perhaps not the the most elegant solution but it worked for me!You can use display: blockExample : I ran into this challenge when building an app where I wanted a table hidden for certain users but not for others. Initially I set it up as display:none but then display:inline-block for those users who I wanted to see it but I experienced the formatting issues you might expect (columns consolidating or generally messy).The way I worked around it was to show the table first and then do \"display:none\" for those users who I didn't want to see it. This way, it formatted normally but then disappeared as needed.Bit of a lateral solution but might help someone!visibility:hidden will hide the element but element is their with DOM. And in case of display:none it'll remove the element from the DOM.So you have option for element to either hide or unhide. But once you delete it ( I mean display none) it has not clear opposite value. display have several values like display:block,display:inline, display:inline-block and many other. you can check it out from W3C.The best answer for display: none isorYou can use this display:block; and also add overflow:hidden;The best \"opposite\" would be to return it to the default value which is:"},

According to the specification, the type attribute is a hint to the browser. If the browser does not support the hinted content type, then it can skip fetching it.My understanding is that it's to allow the specification of stylesheets in formats other than text/css.While that has become the dominant (and standard) delivery format for stylesheets for (X)HTML documents, the specification is actually wide enough to allow a variety of different MIME types to be passed, it's just that standard browsers don't implement them.Not relevant to most people, but some systems (at least Microsoft SharePoint 2013) will use this type attribute when working out how to process HTML (e.g. when creating a .master page file).No it just stands for MIME type, it has been deprecated in HTML, We can drop using it without any browser compatibility."},

The content is drawn using JavaScript on a 300x300 canvas.Why is there a display difference?It seems that the width and height attributes determine the width or height of the canvas's coordinate system, whereas the CSS properties just determine the size of the box in which it will be shown.This is explained at http://www.whatwg.org/html#attr-canvas-width (needs JS) or http://www.whatwg.org/c#attr-canvas-width (will probably eat your computer):To set the width and height you need, you may use For <canvas> elements, the CSS rules for width and height set the actual size of the canvas element that will be drawn to the page. On the other hand, the HTML attributes of width and height set the size of the coordinate system or 'grid' that the canvas API will use.For example, consider this (jsfiddle):Both have had the same thing drawn on them relative to the internal coordinates of the canvas element. But in the second canvas, the red rectangle will be twice as wide because the canvas as a whole is being stretched across a bigger area by the CSS rules.Note: If the CSS rules for width and/or height aren't specified then the browser will use the HTML attributes to size the element such that 1 unit of these values equals 1px on the page. If these attributes aren't specified then they will default to a width of 300 and a height of 150. The canvas will be stretched if you set the width and height in your CSS. If you want to dynamically manipulate the dimension of the canvas you have to use JavaScript like so:The browser uses the css width and height, but the canvas element scales based on the canvas width and height. In javascript, read the css width and height and set the canvas width and height to that.Shannimal correctionIf you want a dynamic behaviour based on, e.g. CSS media queries, don't use canvas width and height attributes. Use CSS rules and then, before getting the canvas rendering context, assign to width and height attributes the CSS width and height styles:"},

So I wanted to have the body text fade in from white(same as site background) to black text colour on page load - and I've only been coding since Monday so I was looking for an 'on.load' style thing code, but don't know JS yet - so here is my code that worked well for me. And for whatever reason, this doesn't work for .class only #id's(at least not on mine)Hope this helps - as I know this site helps me a lot!Well, this is a tricky one.The answer is \"not really\".CSS isn't a functional layer. It doesn't have any awareness of what happens or when. It's used simply to add a presentational layer to different \"flags\" (classes, ids, states).By default, CSS/DOM does not provide any kind of \"on load\" state for CSS to use. If you wanted/were able to use JavaScript, you'd allocate a class to body or something to activate some CSS.That being said, you can create a hack for that. I'll give an example here, but it may or may not be applicable to your situation.We're operating on the assumption that \"close\" is \"good enough\":Here's an excerpt of our CSS stylesheet:We're also on the assumption that modern browsers render progressively, so our last element will render last, and so this CSS will be activated last.Similar to @Rolf's solution, but skip reference to external functions or playing with class.  If opacity is to remain fixed to 1 once loaded, simply use inline script to directly change opacity via style.  For examplewhere CSS sytle \"fadein\" is defined per @Rolf,defining transition and setting opacity to initial state (i.e. 0)the only catch is that this does not work with SPAN or DIV elements, since they do not have working onload eventstart it with hover of body than It will start when the mouse first moves on the screen, which is mostly within a second after arrival, the problem here is that it will reverse when out of the screen.thats the best thing I can think of: http://jsfiddle.net/faVLX/fullscreen: http://jsfiddle.net/faVLX/embedded/result/Edit see comments below:\nThis will not work on any touchscreen device because there is no hover, so the user won't see the content unless they tap it. – Rich BradshawOk I have managed to achieve an animation when the page loads using only css transitions (sort of!):I have created 2 css style sheets:\nthe first is how I want the html styled before the animation... \nand the second is how I want the page to look after the animation has been carried out.I don't fully understand how I have accomplished this but it only works when the two css files (both in the head of my document) are separated by some javascript as follows.I have tested this with Firefox, safari and opera. Sometimes the animation works, sometimes it skips straight to the second css file and sometimes the page appears to be loading but nothing is displayed (perhaps it is just me?)Here is a link to my work-in-progress website: http://www.hankins-design.co.uk/beta2/test/index.htmlMaybe I'm wrong but I thought browsers that do not support css transitions should not have any issues as they should skip straight to the second css file without delay or duration.I am interested to know views on how search engine friendly this method is. With my black hat on I suppose I could fill a page with keywords and apply a 9999s delay on its opacity. I would be interested to know how search engines deal with the transition-delay attribute and whether, using the method above, they would even see the links and information on the page.More importantly I would really like to know why this is not consistent each time the page loads and how I can rectify this!I hope this can generate some views and opinions if nothing else!If anyone else had problems doing two transitions at once, here's what I did. I needed text to come from top to bottom on page load.HTML\nHTML\nCSS\nDon't know why I kept trying to use 2 transition declarations in 1 selector and (not really) thinking it would use both.CSS only with a delay of 3sa few points to take here:Code:Not really, as CSS is applied as soon as possible, but the elements might not be drawn yet. You could guess a delay of 1 or 2 seconds, but this won't look right for most people, depending on the speed of their internet.In addition, if you want to fade something in for instance, it would require CSS that hides the content to be delivered. If the user doesn't have CSS3 transitions then they would never see it.I'd recommend using jQuery (for ease of use + you may wish to add animation for other UAs) and some JS like this: Along with the transitions added in the CSS. This has the advantage of easily allowing the use of animate instead of the second CSS in legacy browsers if required."},

You can't hide the entire image, but you change how the broken icon looks.Despite what people are saying here, you don't need JavaScript at all, you don't even need CSS!!It's actually very doable and simple with HTML only.  You can even show a default image if an image doesn't load. Here's how...This also works on all browsers, even as far back as IE8 (out of 250,000+ visitors to sites I hosted in September 2015, ZERO people used something worse than IE8, meaning this solution works for literally everything).Step 1: Reference the image as an object instead of an img.  When objects fail they don't show broken icons; they just do nothing.  Starting with IE8, you can use Object and Img tags interchangeably.  You can resize and do all the glorious stuff you can with regular images too.  Don't be afraid of the object tag; it's just a tag, nothing big and bulky gets loaded and it doesn't slow down anything.  You'll just be using the img tag by another name.  A speed test shows they are used identically.Step 2: (Optional, but awesome) Stick a default image inside that object. If the image you want actually loads in the object, the default image won't show.  So for example you could show a list of user avatars, and if someone doesn't have an image on the server yet, it could show the placeholder image... no javascript or CSS required at all, but you get the features of what takes most people JavaScript.Here is the code...... Yes, it's that simple.If you want to implement default images with CSS, you can make it even simpler in your HTML like this......and just add the CSS from this answer -> https://stackoverflow.com/a/32928240/3196360Found a great solution at https://bitsofco.de/styling-broken-images/If you will add alt with text alt=\"abc\" it will show the show corrupt thumbnail, and alt message abcIf you will not add alt it will show the show corrupt thumbnailIf you want to hide the broken one\njust add alt=\"\" it will not show corrupt thumbnail and any alt message(without using js)If you want to hide the broken one\njust add alt=\"\" & onerror=\"this.style.display='none'\" it will not show corrupt thumbnail and any alt message(with js)4th one is a little dangerous(not exactly)\n, if you want to add any image in onerror event, it will not display even if Image exist as style.display is like adding. So, use it when you don't require any alternative image to display.If we give it in CSS, then the item will not display(like image, iframe, div like that). If you want to display image & you want to display totally blank space if error, then you can use, but also be careful this will not take any space. So, you need to keep it in a div may beLink https://jsfiddle.net/02d9yshw/I think the easiest way is to hide the broken image icon by the text-indent property.Obviously it doesn't work if you want to see the \"alt\" attribute.  in the case you like to keep/need the image as a placeholder, you could change the opacity to 0 with an onerror and some css to set the image size. This way you will not see the broken link, but the page loads as normal.I liked the answer by Nick and was playing around with this solution. Found a cleaner method. Since ::before/::after pseudos don't work on replaced elements like img and object they will only work if the object data (src) is not loaded. It keeps the HTML more clean and will only add the pseudo if the object fails to load.http://codepen.io/anon/pen/xwqJKQIf you need to still have the image container visible due to it being filled in later on and don't want to bother with showing and hiding it you can stick a 1x1 transparent image inside of the src:<img id=\"active-image\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7\"/>I used this for this exact purpose. I had an image container that was going to have an image loaded into it via Ajax. Because the image was large and took a bit to load, it required setting a background-image in CSS of a Gif loading bar.However, because the src of the  was empty, the broken image icon still appeared in browsers that use it.Setting the transparent 1x1 Gif fixes this problem simply and effectively with no code additions through CSS or JavaScript.Using CSS only is tough, but you could use CSS's background-image instead of <img> tags...Something like this:HTMLCSSHere is a working fiddle.Note: I added the border in the CSS on the fiddle just to demonstrate where the image would be.Use the object tag. Add alternative text between the tags like this:http://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_object.aspYou can follow this path as a css solutionSince 2005, Mozilla browsers such as Firefox have supported the non-standard :-moz-broken CSS pseudo-class that can accomplish exactly this request:img[alt]::before also works in Firefox 64 (though once upon a time it was img[alt]::after so this is not reliable). I can't get either of those to work in Chrome 71.Missing images will either just display nothing, or display a [ ? ] style box when their source cannot be found. Instead you may want to replace that with a \"missing image\" graphic that you are sure exists so there is better visual feedback that something is wrong. Or, you might want to hide it entirely. This is possible, because images that a browser can't find fire off an \"error\" JavaScript event we can watch for.Additionally, you may wish to trigger some kind of Ajax action to send an email to a site admin when this occurs.The trick with img::after is a good stuff, but has at least 2 downsides:I do not know an universal solution without JavaScript, but for Firefox only there is a nice one:A basic and very simple way of doing this without any code required would be to just provide an empty alt statement. The browser will then return the image as blank. It would look just like if the image isn't there.Example:Try it out to see! ;)For future googlers, in 2016 there is a browser safe pure CSS way of hiding empty images using the attribute selector:Edit: I'm back - for future googlers, in 2019 there is a way to style the actual alt text and alt text image in the Shadow Dom, but it only works in developer tools. So you can't use it. Sorry. It would be so nice. "},

On the other hand, you can, however, make a pseudo-relative element, by creating a zero-width, zero-height, relatively positioned element, essentially solely for the purpose of creating a reference point for position, and an absolutely positioned element within that:Add a margin equal to the pixels that you moved:ExampleFrom reading up a little, it seems you can absolute position an element as long as the parent element is relatively positioned. That means if you have the CSS:Then the child element won't take up any space in the document flow at all. You can then position it using one of the \"left\", \"bottom\", etc, properties. The relative positioning on the parent shouldn't usually affect it because it will be positioned at its original position by default if you don't specify \"left\", \"bottom\", etc.http://css-tricks.com/absolute-positioning-inside-relative-positioning/You simply take that element off the document flow by setting position: absolute, and leave it's breaking point move freely with the dynamic flow of content by not specifying the left top right and bottom style properties which will be forcing it to use the relative endpoint of the flow dynamically.

Something like:Edit:\nAnother option is to, instead of removing the style from the input, compensate for it in the wrapped div:This will give you somewhat different results in different browsers, but they will not overlap the container. The values in the div depend on how large the border is on the input and how much space you want between the input and the border.Yes: by using the CSS3 property ‘box-sizing: border-box’, you can redefine what ‘width’ means to include the external padding and border.Unfortunately because it's CSS3, support isn't very mature, and as the spec process isn't finished yet, it has different temporary names in browsers in the meantime. So:The old-school alternative is simply to put a quantity of ‘padding-right’ on the enclosing <div> or <td> element equal to about how much extra left-and-right padding/border in ‘px’ you think browsers will give the input. (Typically 6px for IE<8.)This solved the problem for me!Without the need for an external div. Just apply it to your given text box.With this property \"The width and height properties (and min/max properties) includes content, padding and border, but not the margin\"See description of property at w3schools.Hope this helps someone!Just came across this problem myself, and the only solution I could find that worked in all my test browsers (IE6, IE7, Firefox) was the following:The code:Here, the total horizontal overflow for the input element is 6px - 2x(padding + border) - so we set a padding-right for the inner DIV of 6px.box-sizing support is pretty good actually: http://caniuse.com/#search=box-sizingSo unless you target IE7, you should be able to solve this kind of issues using this property. A layer such as sass or less makes it easier to handle prefixed rules like that, btw.Actually, it's because CSS defines 100% relative to the entire width of the container, including its margins, borders, and padding; that means that the space avail. to its contents is some amount smaller than 100%, unless the container has no margins, borders, or padding. This is counter-intuitive and widely regarded by many to be a mistake that we are now stuck with.  It effectively means that % dimensions are no good for anything other than a top level container, and even then, only if it has no margins, borders or padding.Note that the text field's margins, borders, and padding are included in the CSS size specified for it - it's the container's which throw things off.I have tolerably worked around it by using 98%, but that is a less than perfect solution, since the input fields tend to fall further short as the container gets larger.EDIT: I came across this similar question - I've never tried the answer given, and I don't know for sure if it applies to your problem, but it seems like it will.One solution that may work (it works for me) is to apply negative margin at input (textbox)... or fixed width for ie7 or to drop ie7 support.\nThis results to pixel perfect width.. For me its 7 so i added 3 and 4 but it is still pixel perfect..I had the same problem and i hated to have extra divs for border etc! So here is my solution which seems to work!You should use a ie7 only stylesheet to avoid the starhacks. If you can't use box-sizing:border-box you could try removing the width:100% and putting a very large size attribute in the <input> element, drawback is however you have to modify the html, and can't do it with CSS only:If you don't need to do it dynamically (for example, your form is of a fixed width) you can just set the width of child <input> elements to the width of their container minus any decorations like padding, margin, border, etc.:If you can't use box-sizing (e.g. when you convert HTML to PDF using iText). Try this:CSSHTMLThis works:The first 'width' is a fallback rule for older browsers.Just style the input to offset for the extra padding.  In the following example the padding on the input would be 10px on the left and right for a total padding offset of 20px:"},

Make sure overflow is set to \"scroll\" not \"auto.\" With that said, in OS X Lion, overflow set to \"scroll\" behaves more like auto in that scrollbars will still only show when being used.

The answers above are not valid in all cases any more. Apple is pushing disappearing scrollbars everywhere. Safari, Chrome and even Firefox on MacOs (and iOs) only show scrollbars when actually scrolling — I don't know about current Windows/IE. However there are non-standard ways to style scroll bars on Webkit (IE dropped that a long time ago).Is that what you want?Unfortunately, Opera 9.64 seems to ignore that CSS declaration when applied to HTML or BODY, although it works for other block-level elements like DIV.I use this cross browsers solution (note: I always use DOCTYPE declaration in 1st line, I don't know if it works in quirksmode, never tested it).This will always show an ACTIVE vertical scroll bar in every page, vertical scrollbar will be scrollable only of few pixels.When page contents is shorter than browser's visible area (view port) you will still see the vertical scrollbar active, and it will be scrollable only of few pixels.In case you are obsessed with CSS validation (I'm obesessed only with HTML validation) by using this solution your CSS code would also validate for W3C because you are not using non standard CSS attributes like -moz-scrollbars-verticalbody { height:101%; } will \"crop\" larger pages.Instead, I use:I was able to get this to work by adding it to the body tag. Was nicer for me because I don't have anything on the html element.An alternative approach is to set the width of the html element to 100vw. On many if not most browsers, this negates the effect of scrollbars on the width.Setting height to 101% is my solution to the problem.\nYou pages will no longer 'flick' when switching between ones that exceed the viewport height and ones that do not.works the best for me"},

There is no single answer to which letter is widest.  It depends on the font.  So you'll have to do a similar empirical experiment to figure out the answer for your environment.  But the fact is, most fonts follow the same conventions, and capital W will be the widest.Gist with these character widths in a ratio form (W = 100) captured here using this particular example font:https://gist.github.com/imaurer/d330e68e70180c985b380f25e195b90cFurther to Ned Batchelder's awesomely practical answer, because I came here wondering about digits:  0000000000000000000000000000000000000000111111111111111111111111111111111111111122222222222222222222222222222222222222223333333333333333333333333333333333333333444444444444444444444444444444444444444455555555555555555555555555555555555555556666666666666666666666666666666666666666777777777777777777777777777777777777777788888888888888888888888888888888888888889999999999999999999999999999999999999999How about a programmatic solution?I believe the letter W is the widest.Capital \"M\" is conventionally the widest.Depending on your platform, there might be a way to \"getWidth\" from a string or DrawText() function somehow with a width property. I would make a simple algortime that utilized the needed font and then ran through the alfabet and stored it in a small config or just calculated it at initialization as a loop from A to Z isnt that hard.It also depends on the font. I did this 1 or 2 years ago with Processing and Helvetica and it is ILJTYFVCPAXUZKHSEDORGNBQMW in order of increasing pixels. The idea is to draw the text on a canvas with the font you are looking at, count the pixels, then sort with a HashMap or Dictionary.Of course, this might not be directly relavant to your use as this calculates pixel area rather than just width. Might be a little overkill too.Arial 30px in Chrome - W wins.A solution to calculate the widths of fonts a bit like the solution posted by xxx was posted by Alex Michael on his blog (which funnily enough linked me here).Summary:Original Post: http://alexmic.net/letter-pixel-count/Code:It will depend on the font. I would create a small program in a programming language you're most comfortable with, where you draw each letter of the alphabet into a n times m sized bitmap. Initialize each pixel with white. Then count the number of white pixels after you've drawn each letter and save that number. The highest number you find is the one you're looking for.EDIT: If you're in fact just interested in which one takes up the largest rectangle (but it looks like you're really after that, not the pixels), you can use various API calls to find the size, but that depends on your programming language. In Java, for example, you would use the FontMetrics class.I know the accepted answer here is W, W is for WIN.However, in this case, W is also for Width. The case study used employed a simple width test to examine pixels, but it was only the width, not the total pixel count. As an easy counter example, the accepted answer assumes that O and Q take up the same amount of pixels, yet they only take up the same amount of space.Thus, W takes up the most space. But, is it all the pixels it's cracked up to be?Let's get some empirical data. I created imgur images from the following B, M and W. I then analyzed their pixel count (see below), here are the results:B : 114 pixelsM : 150 pixelsW : 157 pixelsHere is how I fed them into canvas and analyzed the raw pixel data from the images.Want to know the real longest glyph, not just guessing?\nAnd I'm not just talking about the letters, digits and common symbols (!, @ and so on).  I mean the longest glyph in all the 32,834 characters of UTF-16.\nSo I started with answer by @N K that had a programmatic solution to it, and made some slight modifications to it:After running this and waiting (and waiting), it gives the output ௌ won.\nAnd there you have it, the longest character in UTF-32!\nNote that on some fonts the longest glyph is ﷽, but the other fonts (especially monospace ones) overlap the characters, as with the font that the program takes program account.It depends on the font. Crossed zero for example takes up considerably more than a regular one.But if one could put up a guess, I'd go with X or B."},

Add something like...Working FiddleThe best way of doing it is to just trigger bootstraps click event with a hover. This way, it should still remain touch device friendly You can use jQuery's hover function.You just need to add the class open when the mouse enters and remove the class when the mouse leaves the dropdown.Here's my code:An easy way, using jQuery, is this:For CSS it goes crazy when you also click on it. This is the code that I'm using, it also don't change anything for mobile view.In Twitter Bootstrap is not implemented but you can use the this pluginUpdate 1: Sames question hereHover over the nav items to see that they activate on hover.\nhttp://cameronspear.com/demos/twitter-bootstrap-hover-dropdown/#So you have this code:Normally it works on click event, and you want it work on hover event. This is very simple, just use this javascript/jquery code:This works very well and here is the explanation: we have a button, and a menu. When we hover the button we display the menu, and when we mouseout of the button we hide the menu after 100ms. If you wonder why i use that, is because you need time to drag the cursor from the button over the menu. When you are on the menu, the time is reset and you can stay there as many time as you want. When you exit the menu, we will hide the menu instantly without any timeout.I've used this code in many projects, if you encounter any problem using it, feel free to ask me questions.This is what I use to make it dropdown on hover with some jQueryTry this using hover function with fadein fadeout animationsThis will help you make your own hover class for bootstrap:CSS:Margins are set to avoid unwanted close and they are optional.HTML:Don't forget to remove the button attribute data-toggle=\"dropdown\" if you want to remove onclick open, and this also will work when input is append with dropdown.This only hovers the navbar when you are not on a mobile device, because I find that hovering the navigation does not work well on mobile divices:I try other solutions, i'm using bootstrap 3, but dropdown menu closes too quickly to move over itsupposed that you add class=\"dropdown\" to li, i added a timeoutI have published a proper plugin for the dropdown hover functionality, in which you can even define what happens when clicking on the dropdown-toggle element:https://github.com/istvan-ujjmeszaros/bootstrap-dropdown-hoverI had issues with all the previously existing solutions. The simple CSS ones are not using the .open class on the .dropdown, so there will be no feedback on the dropdown toggle element when the dropdown is visible.The js ones are interfering with clicking on .dropdown-toggle, so the dropdown shows up on hover, then hides it when clicking on an opened dropdown, and moving out the mouse will trigger the dropdown to show up again. Some of the js solutions are braking iOS compatibility, some plugins are not working on modern desktop browsers which are supporting the touch events.That's why I made the Bootstrap Dropdown Hover plugin which prevents all these issues by using only the standard Bootstrap javascript API, without any hack.Triggering a click event with a hover has a small error. If mouse-in and then a click creates vice-versa effect. It opens when mouse-out and close when mouse-in. A better solution:html       jquerycodepenThe solution I am proposing detects if its not touch device and that the navbar-toggle (hamburger menu) is not visible and makes the parent menu item revealing submenu on hover and and follow its link on click. Also makes tne margin-top 0 because the gap between the navbar and the menu in some browser will not let you hover to the subitemsBootstrap drop-down Work on hover, and remain close on click by adding property display:block; in css and removing these attributes data-toggle=\"dropdown\" role=\"button\" from button tag"},

No, JavaScript is not an optionOkay, I know this question is old, but 2 years down the track and mozilla have done nothing. I've come up with a simple workaround. This essentially strips all formatting of the select box in firefox and wraps a span element around the select box with your custom style, but should only apply to firefox. Say this is your select menu: And lets assume the css class 'css-select' is: In firefox, this would display with the select menu, followed by the ugly firefox select arrow, followed by your nice custom looking one. Not ideal. Now to get this going in firefox, add a span element around with the class 'css-select-moz': Then fix the CSS to hide mozilla's dirty arrow with -moz-appearance:window and throw the custom arrow into the span's class 'css-select-moz', but only get it to display on mozilla, like this: Pretty cool for only stumbling across this bug 3 hours ago (I'm new to webdesign and completely self-taught). However, this community has indirectly provided me with so much help, I thought it was about time I give something back. I have only tested it in firefox (mac) version 18, and then 22 (after I updated). All feedback is welcome. Update: this was fixed in Firefox v35. See the full gist for details.Just figured out how to remove the select arrow from Firefox. The trick is to use a mix of -prefix-appearance, text-indent and text-overflow. It is pure CSS and requires no extra markup.Tested on Windows 8, Ubuntu and Mac, latest versions of Firefox.Live example: http://jsfiddle.net/joaocunha/RUEbp/1/More on the subject: https://gist.github.com/joaocunha/6273016The trick that works for me is to \nmake select width more than 100% and apply overflow:hiddenThis is the only way right now to hide dropdown arrow in FF.BTW. if you want beautiful dropdowns use http://harvesthq.github.com/chosen/From firefox's official release notes on V35:So now in order to hide the default arrow - it's as easy as adding the following rules on our select element:DEMOWe've found a simple and decent way to do this. It's cross-browser,degradable, and doesn't break a form post. First set the select box's opacity to 0.this is so you can still click on itThen make div with the same dimensions as the select box. The div should lay under the select box as the background. Use { position: absolute } and z-index to achieve this.Update the div's innerHTML with javascript.  Easypeasy with jQuery:That's it! Just style your div instead of the select box. I haven't tested the above code so you'll probably need tweak it. But hopefully you get the gist. I think this solution beats {-webkit-appearance: none;}. What browsers should do at the very most is dictate interaction with form elements, but definitely not how their initially displayed on the page as that breaks site design. Try this way:Then, you can use a different image as background and place it:There is another way for moz browsers:If you have a defined a width to you select, this property will push the default dropbox button under the select area.It works for me! ;)While not a complete solution I've found that……works to some extent. You can't change the background (-color or -image) but the element can be rendered invisible with color: transparent. Not perfect but it's a start and you don't need to replace the system level element with a js one.I think I found the solution compatible with FF31!!!\nHere are two options that are well explained at this link:\nhttp://www.currelis.com/hiding-select-arrow-firefox-30.html\n\nI used option 1: \nRodrigo-Ludgero posted this fix on Github, including an online demo. I tested this demo on Firefox 31.0 and it appears to be working correctly. Tested on Chrome and IE as well. Here is the html code:and the css:http://jsbin.com/pozomu/4/edit\n\nIt works very good for me!Unfortunately for you this is \"something fancy\". Normally it's not the web authors place to redesign form elements. Many browsers purposely don't let you style them, in order for the user to see the OS controls they are used to. The only way to do this consistently over browsers and operating systems, is use JavaScript and replace the select elements with \"DHTML\" ones.Following article show three jQuery based plugins that allow you to do that (it is a bit old, but I couldn't find anything current right now)http://www.queness.com/post/204/25-jquery-plugins-that-enhance-and-beautify-html-form-elements#1I am styling the select just likes thisIt works for me in FF, Safari and Chrome in all versions I've tested.In IE I put:Also you can:\n       .yourclass::-ms-expand {display: none;\n    }\n    .yourid::-ms-exapan {display: none;\n    }I know this question is a bit old, but since it turns up on google, and this is a \"new\" solution:appearance: normal Seems to work fine in Firefox for me (version 5 now). but not in Opera and IE8/9As a workaround for Opera and IE9, I used the :before pseudoselector to create a new white box and put that on top of the arrow.Unfortunately, In IE8 this doesn't work. The box is rendered correctly, but the arrow just sticks out anyway... :-/Using select:before works fine in Opera, but not in IE. If I look at the developer tools, I see it is reading the rules correctly, and then just ignores them (they're crossed out). So I use a <span class=\"selectwrap\"> around the actual <select>.You may need to tweak this a bit, but this works for me!Disclaimer:\nI'm using this to get a good looking hardcopy of a webpage with forms so I don't need to create a second page. I'm not a 1337 haxx0r who wants red scrollbars, <marquee> tags, and whatnot :-) Please do not apply excessive styling to forms unless you have a very good reason.Use the pointer-events property. The idea here is to overlay an element over the native drop down arrow (to create our custom one) and then disallow pointer events on it. [see this post]Here is a working FIDDLE using this method.Also, in this SO answer I discussed this and another method in greater detail.This works (tested on Firefox 23.0.1):building on the answer by @JoãoCunha, one css style that is usefull for more then one browserFurther to Joao Cunha's answer, this problem is now on Mozilla's ToDo List and is targeted for ver 35.For those desiring, here is a workaround by Todd Parker, referenced on Cunha's blog, that works today:http://jsfiddle.net/xvushd7x/HTML:CSS:Since Firefox 35, \"-moz-appearance:none\" that you already wrote in your code, finally remove arrow button as desired.It was a bug solved since that version.A lot of Discussions Happening here & there but I don't see some proper solution for this problem. Finally Ended up by writing a small Jquery + CSS code for doing this HACK on IE & Firefox.Calculate Element Width (SELECT Element) using Jquery.\nAdd a Wrapper Around Select Element and Keep overflow hidden for this element. Make sure that Width of this wrapper is appox. 25px less as that of SELECT Element. This could be easily done with Jquery.\nSo Now Our Icon is Gone..! and it is time for adding our image icon on SELECT element...!!!\nJust add few simple lines for adding background and you are all Done..!!\nMake sure to use overflow hidden for outer wrapper,Here is a Sample of Code which was done for Drupal. However could be used for others also by removing few lines of code which is Drupal Specific.Solution works on All Browsers IE, Chrome & Firefox\nNo need of Adding fixed Widths Hacks Using CSS. It is all being handled Dynamically using JQuery.!More Described at:- http://northwebstudio.com/blogs/1/jquery/remove-drop-down-arrow-html-select-element-using-jquery-and-csstry this cssIts workingThe appearance property from CSS3 does not allow none value. Take a look at the W3C reference. So, what you is trying to do isn't valid (indeed Chrome shouldn't accept too).Then unfortunatelly we really don't have any cross-browser solution to hide that arrow using pure CSS. As pointed, you will need JavaScript.I suggest you to consider using selectBox jQuery plugin. It's very lightweight and nicely done.You could increase the width of the box and move the arrow closer to the left of the arrow. this then allows you to cover the arrow with an empty white div.Have a look: http://jsbin.com/aniyu4/86/editWould you accept minor changes to the html?Something like putting a div tag containing the select tag.Take a look.Or, you can clip the select. Something along the lines of:This should clip 30px of the right side of select box, stripping away the arrow. Now supply a 170px background image and voila, styled selectIt's a huge hack, but -moz-appearance: menulist-text might do the trick.I was having the same issue. It's easy to make it work on FF and Chrome, but on IE (8+ that we need to support) things get complicated. The easiest solution I could find for custom select elements that works \"everywhere I tried\", including IE8, is using .customSelect()A useful hack for me is to set the (selects) display to inline-flex.  Cuts the arrow right out of my select button.  Without all of the added code.Jordan Young's answer is the best.  But if you can't or don't want to change your HTML, you might consider just removing the custom down arrow served to Chrome, Safari, etc and leaving firefox's default arrow - but without double arrows resulting.  Not ideal, but a good quick fix that doesn't add any HTML and doesn't compromise your custom look in other browsers.CSS:hackity hack ... a solution that works in every browser I've tested (Safari, Firefox, Chrome). Don't have any IEs lying around, so it would be nice if you could test and comment:CSS, with url-encoded image:http://codepen.io/anon/pen/myPEByI'm using the :after-element to cover the ugly arrow. Since select doesn't support :after, i need a wrapper to work with.\nNow, if you would click on the arrow, the dropdown won't register it ... unless your browser supports pointer-events: none, which everyone except IE10- does: http://caniuse.com/#feat=pointer-eventsSo for me it's perfect - a nice, clean, low-headache solution, at least compared to all the other options which include javascript.tl;dr:If IE10 (or lower) Users click the arrow, it won't work. Works good enough for me...If you don't mind fiddling with JS, I wrote a small jQuery plugin that helps you do it. With it you don't need to worry about vendor prefixes.Fiddle here:  JS FiddleThe condition is that you have to style the select from scratch (this means setting the background and border), but you probably want to do this anyway. Also since the function substitutes the original select with a div, you will lose any styling done directly on the select selector in your CSS. So give the select element a class and style the class.Supports most modern browsers, if you want to target older browsers, you can try an older version of jQuery, but perhaps have to replace on() with  bind() in the function  (not tested)The other answers didn't seem to work for me, but I found this hack.\nThis worked for me (July 2014)In my case, I also had a woocommerce input field so I used this Updated my answer to show select rather than input"},

Here's the HTML and I've set the 2nd tr in the tbody to class highlight.Table rows cannot have margin values. Can you increase the padding? That would work. Otherwise you could insert a <tr class=\"spacer\"></tr> before and after the class=\"highlighted\" rows.The border-spacing property will work for this particular case.Reference.You can't style the <tr>s themselves, but you can give the <td>s inside the \"highlight\" <tr>s a style, like thisline-height can be the possible solutionI know this is kind of old, but I just got something along the same lines to work.  Couldn't you do this?Hope this helps.First of all, don't try to put a margin to a <tr> or a <td> because it won't work in modern rendering.Although margin doesn't work, padding does work :Warning : This will also push the border further away from the element, if your border is visible, you might want to use solution 2 instead.To keep the border close to the element and mimic the margin, put another <tr> between each of your reel table's <tr> like so :This isn't going to be exactly perfect though I was happy to discover that you can control the horizontal and vertical border-spacing separately:Because margin is ignored on tr, I usually use a workaround, by setting a transparent border-bottom or border-top and setting the background-clip property to padding-box so the background-color does not get painted underneath the border.see a demo here: http://codepen.io/meodai/pen/MJMVNR?editors=1100background-clip is supported in all modern browser. (And IE9+)Alternatively you could use a border-spacing. But this will not work with border-collapse set to collapse.You might try to use CSS transforms for indenting a whole tr:I think this is a valid solution. Seems to work fine in Firefox 16, Chrome 23 and Safari 6 on my OSX. A way to mimic the margin on the row would be to use the pseudo selector to add some spacing on the td.This way anything marked with the highlight class will be separated top and bottom.https://jsfiddle.net/d0zmsrfs/I gave up and inserted a simple jQuery code as below. This will add a tr after every tr, if you have so many trs like me.\nDemo: https://jsfiddle.net/acf9sph6/A hack to give the appearance of margins between table rows is to give them a border the same color as the background. This is useful when styling a 3rd party theme where you can't change the html markup. Eg:Here's a neat way I did it:That will add 4px of vertical spacing between each row.  And if you wanted to not get that border on the last child:Reminder that CSS3 pseudo-selectors will only work in IE 8 and below with selectivizr.add a div to the cells that you would like to add some extra spacing:You can create space between table rows by adding an empty row of cells like this...CSS can then be used to target the empty cells like this…NB: This technique is only good if none of your normal cells will be empty/vacant.Even a non-breaking space will do to avoid a cell from being targetted by the CSS rule above.Needless to mention that you can adjust the space's height to whatever you like with the height property included.add this style before the class=\"highlighted\"\npadding-bottom and\ndisplay is inline-tableAnother possibility is to use a pseudo selector :after or :beforeThat might avoid issues with browser that don't understand the pseudo selectors, plus background-colors are not an issue.The downside is however, that it adds some extra whitespace after the last cell.For what is worth, I took advantage that I was already using bootstrap (4.3), because I needed to add margin, box-shadow and border-radius to my row, something I can't do with tables.On css I added a few lines to mantain the table behavior of bootstrap"},

CSS has no (pseudo) selectors for <input> value(s). See:The :empty selector refers only to child nodes, not input values.\n[value=\"\"] does work; but only for the initial state.  This is because a node's value attribute (that CSS sees), is not the same as the node's value property (Changed by the user or DOM javascript, and submitted as form data).Unless you care only about the initial state, you must use a userscript or Greasemonkey script.  Fortunately this is not hard.  The following script will work in Chrome, or Firefox with Greasemonkey or Scriptish installed, or in any browser that supports userscripts (i.e. most browsers, except IE).See a demo of the limits of CSS plus the javascript solution at this jsBin page.It is possible, with the usual CSS caveats and if the HTML code can be modified. If you add the required attribute to the element, then the element will match :invalid or :valid according to whether the value of the control is empty or not. If the element has no value attribute (or it has value=\"\"), the value of the control is initially empty and becomes nonempty when any character (even a space) is entered.Example:The pseudo-classed :valid and :invalid are defined in Working Draft level CSS documents only, but support is rather widespread in browsers, except that in IE, it came with IE 10.If you would like to make “empty” include values that consist of spaces only, you can add the attribute pattern=.*\\S.*.There is (currently) no CSS selector for detecting directly whether an input control has a nonempty value, so we need to do it indirectly, as described above.Generally, CSS selectors refer to markup or, in some cases, to element properties as set with scripting (client-side JavaScript), rather than user actions. For example, :empty matches element with empty content in markup; all input elements are unavoidably empty in this sense. The selector [value=\"\"] tests whether the element has the value attribute in markup and has the empty string as its value. And :checked and :indeterminate are similar things. They are not affected by actual user input.You can use the :placeholder-shown pseudo class. Technically a placeholder is required, but you can use a space instead.and will work :-)edit: http://jsfiddle.net/XwZR2/Basically what everybody is looking for is:LESS:Pure CSS:You can use the placeholder trick as written above w/o required field.The problem with required is that when you wrote something, then deleted it - the input will now always be red as part of the HTML5 spec - then you'll need a CSS as written above to fix/override it.You can simple do thing w/o requiredCSSCode pen:https://codepen.io/arlevi/pen/LBgXjZSimple css:This code is going to apply the given css if the input is filled up.You can style input[type=text] differently depending on whether or not the input has text by styling the placeholder. This is not an official standard at this point but has wide browser support, though with different prefixes:Example: http://fiddlesalad.com/scss/input-placeholder-cssUsing JS and CSS :not pseudoclassThe valid selector will do the trick.Simple Trick with jQuery and CSS Like so:JQuery:CSS:do it on the HTML part like this:The required parameter will require it to have text in the input field in order to be valid.Yes! you can do it with simple basic attribute with value selector.This is not possible with css. To implement this you will have to use JavaScript (e.g. $(\"#input\").val() == \"\")."},

The span option works if the container is variable in size.

No matter how I make my list items into a menu, I always get spaces.I have seen this and answered on it before: After further research I have\n discovered that inline-block is a\n whitespace dependent method and\n is dependent on the font setting. In this case 4px is rendered.To avoid this you could run all your\n lis together in one line, or block\n the end tags and begin tags together\n like this:Example here.As mentioned by other answers and comments, the best practice for solving this is to add font-size: 0; to the parent element: This is better for HTML readability (avoiding running the tags together etc). The spacing effect is because of the font's spacing setting, so you must reset it for the inlined elements and set it again for the content within.Solution:You must set parent font size to 0I would add the CSS property of float left as seen below. That gets rid of the extra space.Actually, this is not specific to display:inline-block, but also applies to display:inline. Thus, in addition to David Horák's solution, this also works:Another solution, similar to Gerbus' solution, but this also works with relative font sizing.I had the same problem, when I used a  inline-block on my menu I had the space between each \"li\" I found a simple solution, I don't remember where I found it, anyway here is what I did.You add a comment sign between  each end of, and start of : \"li\" \nThen the horizontal space disappear.\nHope that answer to the question \nThanks just remove the breaks between li's in your html code...\nmake the li's in one line only..Even if its not inline-block based, this solution might worth consideration (allows nearly same formatting control from upper levels)."},

This is non-standard code that has been painstakingly crafted to target single browser versions only and cannot work if they are altered. If you wish to use it with those, you must load your chosen CSS hack AFTER any filter or compiler. This may seem like a given but there has been a lot of confusion among people who do not realize that they are undoing a hack by running it through such software which was not designed for this purpose.Safari has changed since version 6.1, as many have noticed.Please note: if you are using Chrome [and now also Firefox] on iOS (at least in iOS versions 6.1 and newer) and you wonder why none of the hacks seem to be separating Chrome from Safari, it is because the iOS version of Chrome is using the Safari engine. It uses Safari hacks not the Chrome ones. More about that here: https://allthingsd.com/20120628/googles-chrome-for-ios-is-more-like-a-chrome-plated-apple/ Firefox for iOS was released in Fall 2015. It also responds to the Safari Hacks, but none of the Firefox ones, same as iOS Chrome.ALSO: If you have tried one or more of the hacks and have trouble getting them to work, please post sample code (better yet a test page) - the hack you are attempting, and what browser(s) (exact version!) you are using as well as the device you are using. Without that additional information, it is impossible for me or anyone else here to assist you.Often it is a simple fix or a missing semicolon. With CSS it is usually that or a problem of which order the code is listed in the style sheets, if not just CSS errors. Please do test the hacks here on the test site. If it works there, that means the hack really is working for your setup, but it is something else that needs to be resolved. People here really do love to help, or at least point you in the right direction.The test site: https://browserstrangeness.bitbucket.io/css_hacks.html#safariAND MIRROR!https://browserstrangeness.github.io/css_hacks.html#safariThat out of the way here are hacks for you to use for more recent versions of Safari. You should try this one first as it covers current Safari versions and is pure-Safari only:This one still works properly with Safari 13 (early-2020):To cover more versions, 6.1 and up, at this time you have to use the next pair of css hacks. The one for 6.1-10.0 to go with one that handles 10.1 and up.So then -- here is one I worked out for Safari 10.1+:The double media query is important here, don't remove it.Try this one if SCSS or other tool set has trouble with the nested media query:This next one works for 6.1-10.0 but not 10.1 (Late March 2017 update)This hack I created over many months of testing and experimentation by combining multiple other hacks. NOTES: like above, the double media query is NOT an accident -- it rules out many older browsers that cannot handle media query nesting. -- The missing space after one of the 'and's is important as well. This is after all, a hack... and the only one that works for 6.1 and all newer Safari versions at this time. Also be aware as listed in the comments below, the hack is non-standard css and must be applied AFTER a filter. Filters such as SASS engines will rewrite/undo or completely remove it outright.As mentioned above, please check my test page to see it working as-is (without modification!)And here is the code:For more 'version specific' Safari CSS, please continue to read below.Slightly modified works for 10.1 (only):One for Safari 10.0:Safari 10.0 (Non-iOS Devices):Safari 9 CSS Hacks:One for Safari 9.0 and up:and a support features query too:One for Safari 9.0-10.0:Safari 9 now includes feature detection so we can use that now...Now to target iOS devices only. As mentioned above, since Chrome on iOS is rooted in Safari, it of course hits that one as well.one for Safari 9.0+ but not iOS devices:And one for Safari 9.0-10.0 but not iOS devices:Below are hacks that separate 6.1-7.0, and 7.1+\nThese also required a combination of multiple hacks in order to get the right result:Since I have pointed out the way to block iOS devices, here is the modified version of Safari 6.1+ hack that targets non-iOS devices:To use them:Usually [like in this question] the reason people ask about Safari hacks is \nmostly in reference to separating it from Google Chrome (again NOT iOS!)\nIt may be important to post the alternative: how to target Chrome separately\nfrom Safari as well, so I am providing that for you here in case it is needed.Here are the basics, again check my test page for lots of specific versions of Chrome, but these cover Chrome in general. Chrome is version 45, Dev and Canary versions are up to version 47 at this time.My old media query combo I put on browserhacks still works just for Chrome 29+:An @supports feature query works well for Chrome 29+ as well... a modified version of the one we were using for Chrome 28+ below. Safari 9, the coming Firefox browsers, and the Microsoft Edge browser are not picked up with this one:Previously, Chrome 28 and newer were easy to target. This is one I sent to browserhacks after seeing it included within a block of other CSS code (not originally intended as a CSS hack) and realized what it does, so I extracted the relevant portion for our purposes: [ NOTE: ] This older method below now pics up Safari 9 and the Microsoft Edge browser without the above update. The coming versions of Firefox and Microsoft Edge have added support for multiple -webkit- CSS codes in their programming, and both Edge and Safari 9 have added support for @supports feature detection. Chrome and Firefox included @supports previously.The block of Chrome versions 22-28 (If needed to support older versions) are also possible to target with a twist on my Safari combo hacks I posted above:Like the Safari CSS formatting hacks above, these can be used as follows:So you don't have to search for it in this post, here is my live test page again:https://browserstrangeness.bitbucket.io/css_hacks.html#safari[Or the Mirror]https://browserstrangeness.github.io/css_hacks.html#safariThe test page has many others as well, specifically version-based to further\nhelp you differentiate between Chrome and Safari, and also many hacks for Firefox, Microsoft Edge, and Internet Explorer web browsers.NOTE: If something doesn't work for you, check the test page first, but provide example code and WHICH hack you are attempting for anyone to assist you.There is a way to filter Safari 5+ from Chrome:Sarari OnlyThis hack 100% work only for safari. I've just tested it with success.For those who want to implement a hack for Safari 7.0 and below, but not 7.1 and above -- use:Replace your class in (.myClass)/* Safari only */\n.myClass:not(:root:root) { \n    enter code here\n}I like to use the following method:By the way, for any of you guys that just need to target Safari on mobiles, just add a media query to this hack:And don't forget to add the .safari_only class to the element you want to target, example:When using this safari-only filter I could target Safari (iOS and Mac), but exclude Chrome (and other browsers):Step 1: use https://modernizr.com/Step 2: use the html class .regions to select only SafariModernizr will add html classes to the DOM based on what the current browser supports.  Safari supports regions http://caniuse.com/#feat=css-regions whereas other browsers do not (yet anyway).  This method is also very effective in selecting different versions of IE.  May the force be with you.hi i ve made this and it worked for meYou can use a media-query hack to select Safari 7+ from other browsers.Disclaimer: This hack also targets old Chrome versions (before July 2013).Note: If iOS-only is sufficient (if you're willing to sacrifice Safari desktop), then this works: This works:I have tested and it worked for meAt the end I use a little JavaScript to achieve it:then in my CSS to target Apple browser engine the selector will be:https://stackoverflow.com/a/17637937/3174065\nit is answered here though this method does use some JS. if used, be sure to put the js in the footer, the body has to be fully loaded for this to fire properly, when placed in the head it errors because it fires before the body is loaded.it then adds a .safari class to the body, but only in safari, making targeting the css very easy.It working 100% in safari..i tried"},

The specific example is displayed below...You can make responsive grid of squares with verticaly and horizontaly centered content only with CSS. I will explain how in a step by step process but first here are 2 demos of what you can achieve :\nNow let's see how to make these fancy responsive squares!The trick for keeping elements square (or whatever other aspect ratio) is to use percent padding-bottom.\nSide note: you can use top padding too or top/bottom margin but the background of the element won't display.As top padding is calculated according to the width of the parent element (See MDN for reference), the height of the element will change according to its width. You can now Keep its aspect ratio according to its width.\nAt this point you can code :HTML :CSSHere is a simple layout example of 3*3 squares grid using the code above.With this technique, you can make any other aspect ratio, here is a table giving the values of bottom padding according to the aspect ratio and a 30% width.As you can't add content directly inside the squares (it would expand their height and squares wouldn't be squares anymore) you need to create child elements (for this example I am using divs) inside them with position: absolute; and put the content inside them. This will take the content out of the flow and keep the size of the square. Don't forget to add position:relative; on the parent divs so the absolute children are positioned/sized relatively to their parent.Let's add some content to our 3x3 grid of squares :HTML :CSS :RESULT <-- with some formatting to make it pretty!\nHorizontally :This is pretty easy, you just need to add text-align:center to .content.\nRESULTVertical alignmentThis becomes serious! The trick is to use but we can't use display:table; on .square or .content divs because it conflicts with position:absolute; so we need to create two children inside .content divs. Our code will be updated as follow :HTML :CSS :\nWe have now finished and we can take a look at the result here :editable fiddle hereYou could use vw (view-width) units, which would make the squares responsive according to the width of the screen.A quick mock-up of this would be:The accepted answer is great, however this can be done with flexbox.Here's a grid system written with BEM syntax that allows for 1-10 columns to be displayed per row.If there the last row is incomplete (for example you choose to show 5 cells per row and there are 7 items), the trailing items will be centered horizontally. To control the horizontal alignment of the trailing items, simply change the justify-content property under the .square-grid class.Fiddle: https://jsfiddle.net/patrickberkeley/noLm1r45/3/This is tested in FF and Chrome.I use this solution for responsive boxes of different rations:HTML:CSS:See demo on JSfiddle.net"},

All it does is hide it from the user's eyes.To actually disable your fields, you must use the disabled attribute in HTML or the disabled DOM property in JavaScript.You can't use CSS to disable Textbox.\nsolution would be HTML Attribute.The practical solution is to use CSS to actually hide the input.To take this to its natural conclusion, you can write two html inputs for each actual input (one enabled, and one disabled) and then use javascript to control the CSS to show and hide them.first time answering something, and seemingly just a bit late...I agree to do it by javascript, if you're already using it.For a composite structure, like I usually use, I've made a css pseudo after element to block the elements from user interaction, and allow styling without having to manipulate the entire structure.For Example:I can place a disabled class on the wrapping divThis would grey text within the div and make it unusable to the user.My example JSFiddleI am always using: and then applying the css class to the input field: I know this question is quite old but for other users who come across this problem, I suppose the easiest way to disable input is simply by ':disabled'In reality, if you have some script to disable the input dynamically/automatically with javascript or jquery that would automatically disable based on the condition you add.In jQuery for Example:Hope the answer in CSS helps.You cannot do that I'm afraid, but you can do the following in jQuery, if you don't want to add the attributes to the fields. Just place this inside your <head></head> tagIf you are generating the fields in the DOM (with JS), you should do this instead:This can be done for a non-critical purpose by putting an overlay on top of your input element. Here's my example in pure HTML and CSS.https://jsfiddle.net/1tL40L99/There's no way to use CSS for this purpose.\nMy advice is to include a javascript code where you assign or change the css class applied to the inputs.\nSomething like that :"},

If I could even selectively render certain directories (without including subdirectories) it would make the whole process a lot less rigid.Thanks!I've discovered a way to make it less rigid and future proof by still using the asset pipeline but having the stylesheets grouped. It's not much simpler than your solution, but this solution allows you to automatically add new stylesheets without having to re-edit the whole structure again.What you want to do is use separate manifest files to break things up. First you have to re-organize your app/assets/stylesheets folder:Then you edit the three manifest files:Next you update your application layout file:Lastly, don't forget to include these new manifest files in your config/environments/production.rb:Update:As Max pointed out, if you follow this structure you have to be mindful of image references. You have a few choices:Came across this problem today.Ended up putting all IE specific stylesheets into lib/assets/stylesheets and creating one manifest file per version of IE. Then in application.rb add them to the list of things to precompile :And in your layouts, conditionally include those manifest files and you're good to go!Thats a pretty neat way to do it.  I use conditional classes on html or modernizr.  See this article for a good representation on what does what.\nmodernizr-vs-conditional-classes-on-html"},

I want the page to validate, so what should I do?I have this CSS on the <div>, which has an ID of page:Percentage of what?To set a percentage height, its parent element(*) must have an explicit height. This is fairly self-evident, in that if you leave height as auto, the block will take the height of its content... but if the content itself has a height expressed in terms of percentage of the parent you've made yourself a little Catch 22. The browser gives up and just uses the content height.So the parent of the div must have an explicit height property. Whilst that height can also be a percentage if you want, that just moves the problem up to the next level.If you want to make the div height a percentage of the viewport height, every ancestor of the div, including <html> and <body>, have to have height: 100%, so there is a chain of explicit percentage heights down to the div.(*: or, if the div is positioned, the ‘containing block’, which is the nearest ancestor to also be positioned.)Alternatively, all modern browsers and IE>=9 support new CSS units relative to viewport height (vh) and viewport width (vw):See here for more info.You need to set the height on the <html> and <body> elements as well; otherwise, they will only be large enough to fit the content. For example:bobince's answer will let you know in which cases \"height: XX%;\" will or won't work.If you want to create an element with a set ratio (height: % of it's own width), the best way to do that is by effectively setting the height using padding-bottom. Example for square:The square container will just be made of padding, and the content will expand to fill the container. Long article from 2009 on this subject: http://alistapart.com/article/creating-intrinsic-ratios-for-videoYou can use 100vw / 100vh.   CSS3 gives us viewport-relative units. 100vw means 100% of the viewport width. 100vh; 100% of the height. In other case to get rid of that defining parent percentage you can usebody{height:100vh}vh stands for viewport heightI think it helpSometimes, you may want to conditionally set the height of a div, such as when the entire content is less than the height of the screen. Setting all parent elements to 100% will cut off content when it is longer than the screen size.So, the way to get around this is to set the min-height:Continue to let the parent elements automatically adjust their height\nThen in your main div, subtract the pixel sizes of the header and footer div from 100vh (viewport units).  In css, something like:min-height: calc(100vh - 246px);100vh is full length of the screen, minus the surrounding divs.\nBy setting min-height and not height, content longer than screen will continue to flow, instead of getting cut off."},

This is how IE and FF handle the situation, and as far as I know, not wrong according to the spec. The question is, how can I prevent it?I have found a solution to this problem. Applying an ul { overflow: hidden; } to the ul ensures that the box itself is pushed aside by the float, instead of the contents of the box.Only IE6 needs an ul { zoom: 1; } in our conditional comments to make sure the ul has layout.Adding an improvement to Glen E. Ivey's solution:http://jsfiddle.net/mblase75/TJELt/I prefer this technique, since it works when the list needs to flow around the floating image, while the overflow: hidden technique will not. However, it's also necessary to add padding-right: 1em to the li to keep them from overflowing their container. This is where the \"display\" property comes into its own. Set the CSS below to make the list work alongside the floated content.display: table; works alongside floated content (filling the gap) but without hiding content behind it. Much like a table does :-)EDIT: Remember to add a class to isolate which lists you wish to do this for. E.g. \"ul.in-content\" or more generally \".content ul\"Try list-style-position: inside to change the layout of the bullets.At http://archivist.incutio.com/viewlist/css-discuss/106382 I found a suggestion that worked for me:  style the 'li' elements with:Where you replace \"1em\" with the width of the left padding/margin that your list items would have if the float weren't present.  This works great in my application, even handling the case where the bottom of the float occurs in the middle of the lists--the bullets shift back over to the (local) left margin just right.By adding overflow: auto; to your ul works for me at least.UpdateI've updated my jsfiddle to visualize what's going on. When having the ul beside the floating img, the content of the ul will be pushed by the float, but not the actual container. By adding overflow: auto the whole ul-box will be pushed by the float instead of only the content.The solution is as easy as:A block box with overflow: other than visible establishes a new block formatting context for its contents. W3C recommendation: http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/visuren.html#block-formattingExample:The buttons on my website, which are <li> in disguise, are made like this. Make the viewport (window) of your browser smaller to see the indenting in action.Related answers:Article with examples:You could assign position: relative; left: 10px; to the li. (You may additionally want to give it a margin-right: 10px;, otherwise it might become too wide on the right side.)Or, if you want to use float for the ul -- as suggested by others -- you can probably stop the rest from floating right of the ul by using clear: left on the element that follows the ul.I am using this to solve this problem:Lists next to floated elements cause issues. In my opinion, the best way to prevent these sorts of floating issues is to avoid floating images that intersect with content. It'll also help when you have to support responsive design.A simple design of having centered images between paragraphs will look very attractive and be much easier to support than trying to get too fancy. It's also one step away from a <figure>.Ok, so if you're crazy persistent enough to continue down this path, there are a couple techniques that can be used.The simplest is to make the list use overflow: hidden or overflow: scroll so that the list is essentially shrink wrapped which pulls the padding back to where it's useful:This technique has a few problems though. If the list gets long, it doesn't actually wrap around the image, which pretty much defeats the entire purpose of using float on the image.Ok, so if you're even crazier more persistent and you absolutely must continue down this path, there's another technique that can be used to wrap the list items and maintain bullets.Instead of padding the <ul> and trying to get it to behave nicely with bullets (which it never seems to want to do), take those bullets away from the <ul> and give them to the <li>s. Bullets are dangerous, and the <ul> just isn't responsible enough to handle them properly.This wrapping behavior can do weird things to complex content, so I don't recommend adding it by default. It's much easier to set it up as something that can be opted into rather than something that has to be overridden.Try the following on your UL tag. This should take care of the bullets overlaying your image and you don't have to mess up your left allignment caused by list-position: inside.Struggled with this myself. Best I've managed is the following:The text is not actually indented but the bullet shows.Edited to update based on OP's commentok, then just break it up into 2 divs nested togethertry changing the ul li css toul  {float:left;  background: blue; }After fighting with this interesting issue in several projects, and investigating why it happens, I finally believe I found both: a working and 'responsive' solution.Here is the magic trick, live example: http://jsfiddle.net/superKalo/phabbtnx/Working inside an LMS without access to head of doc, found it easier to go with margin-right: 20px as an inline style for the image. Which I owe to this site.try this:If you want them to go left, just put in a -##px value.or you could do this:and then remove all the styling from the liHow about this? margin-left: auto will cause the element itself to be right aligned.\nSet height and width of the element you want - in my it's a background image in a div inside \n    You could try also floating the ul to the left, and define an appropriate width for it, so that it floats next to the image.Something a little like this jsfiddle?I fixed it withAdd display:table;  to ul:"},

This means it will treat conditional comments just like any other browser would: as regular HTML comments, meant to be ignored entirely. Looking at the markup given in the question as an example, all browsers including IE10 will ignore the comment portions, highlighted gray, entirely. The HTML5 standard makes no mention of conditional comment syntax, and this is exactly why they have chosen to stop supporting it in IE10.Note, however, that conditional compilation in JScript is still supported, as shown in the comments as well as the more recent answers. It's not going away in the final release either, unlike jQuery.browser. And of course, it goes without saying that user-agent sniffing remains as fragile as ever and should never be used under any circumstances.If you really must target IE10, either use conditional compilation which may still see support in the near future, or — if you can help it — use a feature detection library such as Modernizr instead of (or in conjunction with) browser detection. Unless your use case requires noscript or accommodating IE10 on the server side, user-agent sniffing is going to be more of a headache than a viable option.Sounds pretty cumbersome, but remember that as a modern browser that's highly conformant to today's Web standards1, assuming you've written interoperable code that is highly standards-compliant, you shouldn't have to set aside special code for IE10 unless absolutely necessary, i.e. it's supposed to resemble other browsers in terms of behavior and rendering.2 And it sounds far-fetched, given IE's history, but how many times have you expected Firefox or Chrome to behave the same way only to be met with dismay?If you do have a legitimate reason to be targeting certain browsers, by all means sniff them out with the other tools given to you. I'm just saying that you're going to be much more hard-pressed to find such a reason today than what it used to be, and it's really just not something you can rely on.1 Not only IE10, but IE9, and even IE8 which handles most of the mature CSS2.1 standard far better than Chrome, simply because IE8 was so focused on standards compliance (at which time CSS2.1 was already pretty stable with only minor differences from today's recommendation) while Chrome seems to be little more than a half-polished tech demo of cutting-edge pseudo-standards.2 And I may be biased when I say this, but it sure as hell does. If your code works in other browsers but not IE, the odds that it's an issue with your own code rather than IE10 are far better compared to, say, 3 years ago, with previous versions of IE. Again, I may be biased, but let's be honest: aren't you too? Just look at your comments.A good place to start is the IE Standards Support Documentation. Here is how to target IE10 in JavaScript:Here is how to target IE10 in CSS:In case IE11 needs to be filtered or reset via CSS, see another \nquestion:\nHow to write a CSS hack for IE 11?Both solutions posted here (with slight modifications) work:orYou include either of the above lines inside of head tag of your html page before your css link. And then in css file you specify your styles having \"ie10\" class as a parent:And voilà! - other browsers stay intact. And you don't need jQuery. You can see the example how I implemented it here: http://kardash.net.I've written a small, vanilla JavaScript plugin called Layout Engine, which allows you to feature detect IE 10 (and every other browser), in a simple way that cannot be faked, unlike user agent sniffing.It adds the rendering engine name as a class on the html tag and returns a JavaScript object containing the vendor and version (where appropriate)Check out my blog post: http://mattstow.com/layout-engine.html and get the code on GitHub: https://github.com/stowball/Layout-EngineI use this script - it's antiquated, but effective in targeting a separate Internet Explorer 10 style sheet or JavaScript file that is included only if the browser is Internet Explorer 10, the same way you would with conditional comments. No jQuery or other plugin is required.You can use PHP to add a stylesheet for IE 10Like:If you must do this, you can check the user agent string in JavaScript:As other people have mentioned, I'd always recommend feature detection instead.If you want to target IE 10 with Vanilla JavaScript, you might want to try CSS property detection: Instead of msTouchAction you can also use one of these CSS properties, because they are currently only available in IE 10. But this might change in the future.I've put together a test page with all properties on CodePen. clipBoardData is a function that is only available in IE, so if you are seeking to target all IE versions you can useCSS for IE10+ and IE9You could use feature detection to see if browser is IE10 or greater like so:Only true if > IE9Conditionizr (see docs) will add browser CSS classes to your html element, including ie10. With JavaScript:Work for all IE.So change /Trident/g by /Trident/x.0/g where x = 4, 5, 6 or 7 (or maybe 8 for the future).I just wanted to add my version of IE detection. It's based on a snippet found at http://james.padolsey.com/javascript/detect-ie-in-js-using-conditional-comments/ and exteded to also support ie10 and ie11. It detects IE 5 to 11.All you need to do is add it somewhere and then you can always check with a simple condition.

See this pen I made to showcase it.I thought about this for the last 4 weeks and came up with this solution.  Live Demo[Edit]\nI wrote a more indepth post on CSS-Tricks  This technique is using CSS Regions so the browser support is not the best at this moment. (http://caniuse.com/#feat=css-regions)The key part of this technique is to split apart content from layout by using CSS Region. First define a .content element with flow-into:content and then use the appropriate structure to blur the header.The layout structure:The two important parts of this layout are .header__background and .phone__content - these are the containers where the content should flow though.  Using CSS Regions it is simple as flow-from:content (.content is flowing into the named region content)Now comes the tricky part. We want to always flow the content through the .header__background because that is the section where the content will be blured. (using webkit-filter:blur(10px);)This is done by transfrom:translateY(-$HeightOfTheHeader) the .content to ensure that the content will always flow though the .header__background. This transform while always hide some content beneath the header. Fixing this is ease addingto accommodate for the transform. This is currently working in:This is sort of possible with FireFox now thanks to the element style attribute.This experimental attribute lets you use any HTML content as a background image. So, to create the background you need three overlays:So, put together:SVG blur filter (works in FX, other browsers could use filter:blur()):CSS blur style:Finally 3 layers:Then to move this around just set the background-position (sample in jQuery but you could use anything):Here it is as a JS Fiddle, FX only.Check out this demo page. \nThis demo uses html2canvas for rendering document as an image.http://blurpopup.labs.daum.net/This pen I found the other day seemed to do it beautifully, just a bit of css and 21 lines of javascript. I hadn't heard of the cloneNode js command until I found this, but it totally worked for what I needed for sure.http://codepen.io/rikschennink/pen/zvcgxDetail:\nA. Basically it looks at your content div and invokes a cloneNode on it so it creates a duplicate which it then places inside the overflow:hidden header object sitting on top of the page. \nB. Then it simply listens for scrolling so that both images seem to match and blurs the header image... annnnd BAM. Effect achieved. Not really fully do-able in CSS until they get the lil bit of scriptability built into the language.Example is here:http://versie1.com/TEST/ios7/made a quick demo yesterday that actually does what your talking about. http://bit.ly/10clOM9 \nthis demo does the parallax based on the accelerometer so it works best on an iPhone itself. I basically just copy the content we are overlaying into a fixed position element that gets blurred. note: swipe up to see the panel.(i used horrible css id's but you get the idea)Am not very sure about that, I believe that CSS isn't capable of doing this at the momentHowever Chris Coyier has blogged about an old technique with multiple images to achieve such effect, http://css-tricks.com/blurry-background-effect/Check this one out http://codepen.io/GianlucaGuarini/pen/Hzrhf\nSeems like it does the effect without duplication the background image of the element under itself. See texts are blurring also in the example.

Solution isn't universal, meaning one would have to tweak some of the positions and stuff depending on the actual design.Basically what I did is: on trigger clone/remove the whole background (what should be blurred) to a container with unblurred content (which, optionally, has hidden overflow if it is not full width) and position it correctly. Caveat is that on window resize blurred div will mismatch the original in terms of position, but this could be solved with some on window resize function (honestly I couldn't be bothered with that now).I would really appreciate your opinion on this solution!ThanksHere is the fiddle, not tested in IE.HTMLCSSjQuery"},

I also noticed many people shifting element size to 0, or pushing it out of bounds with positioning and overflow adjustments.  These are all great ideas.\nAn alternative way that also seems to work perfectly well is to just set the opacity to 0.  Then you can always just set the position to keep it from offsetting other elements as hide does.  It just seems a little unnecessary to shift an element nearly 10K pixels in any direction.Here's a little example for those who want one:Just for the sake of curiosity, you can do something like you want by dynamically creating an upload form and input file, without adding it to the DOM tree:No need to add the uploadForm to the DOM.Correct code:That's on purpose and by design.

The LABEL element doesn't do that automatically, of course. I usually just put it inside the LABEL, as its text content).Beware though! The manipulation of the look and behaviour of this is limited to whatever you can imagine and think of.    ;-)  ;-)I managed with a simple $(...).click(); with JQuery 1.6.1or else simplyi had problems with custom client side validation for <input type=\"file\"/> while using a fake button to trigger it and  @Guillaume Bodi's solution worked for me (also with opacity: 0; on chrome) and css style for upload input Try this, it's a hack. the Position:absolute is for Chrome and trigger('change') is for IE.My problem was a little bit different on iOS 7. Turns out FastClick was causing problems. All I had to do was add class=\"needsclick\" to my button.This is probably the best answer, keeping in mind the cross browser issues.CSS:JS:HTML:I think i understand your problem, because i have a similar.\nSo the tag <label> have the atribute for, you can use this atribute to link your input with type=\"file\".\nBut if you don't want to activate this using this label because some rule of your layout, you can do like this.Of course you will adapt this for your own purpose and layout, but that's the more easily way i know to make it work!!Based on Guillaume Bodi's answer I did this:which means it's hidden to start with and then displayed for the trigger, then hidden again immediately."},

I don't think it is possible but maybe there is a way someone knows about.BR generates a line-break and it is only a line-break. As this element has no content, there are only few styles that make sense to apply on it, like clear or position. You can set BR's border but you won't see it as it has no visual dimension.If you like to visually separate two sentences, then you probably want to use the horizontal ruler which is intended for this goal. Since you cannot change the markup, I'm afraid using only CSS you cannot achieve this.It seems, it has been already discussed on other forums. Extract from Re: Setting the height of a BR element using CSS:I also found a clarification in the CSS 1 specification (no higher level spec mentions it):Grant Wagner's tests show that there is no way to style BR as you can do with other elements. There is also a site online where  you can test the results in your browser.Updatepelms made some further investigations, and pointed out that IE8 (on Win7) and Chrome 2/Safari 4b allows you to style BR somewhat. And indeed, I checked the IE demo page with IE Net Renderer's IE8 engine, and it worked.Update 2\nc69 made some further investigations, and it turns out you can style the marker for br quite heavily (though, not cross-browser), yet this will not affect the line-break itself, because it seem to belong to parent container.Try the following, I put it together using Update 2 from another answer with high votes, and it worked perfectly for me:There is one good reason you would need to style a <br> tag.When it is part of code you don't want to (or can't) change and you want this particular <br> not to be displayed.Can save a lot of time and sometimes your day.For the benefit of any future visitors who may have missed my comments:does not work.It has been tested in IE 6, 7 & 8, Firefox 2, 3 & 3.5B4, Safari 3 & 4 for Windows, Opera 9.6 & 10 (alpha) and Google Chrome (version 2) and it didn't work in any of them. If at some point in the future someone finds a browser that does support a border on a <br> element, please feel free to update this list.Also note that I tried a number of other things:Of those, the following does works in Opera 9.6 and 10 (alpha) (thanks porneL!):Not very useful when it is only supported in one browser, but I always find it interesting to see how different browsers implement the specification.I know you can't edit the HTML, but if you can modify the CSS, can you add javascript?if so, you can include jquery, then you could dorenders as below in IE8... not a lot of use in just one browser though.(N.B. I'm using IE 8.0.7100 (on Win7 RC) if that makes any difference)Also,   or,    br { content: \"\" }gives a dashed line in Chrome 2 / Safari 4b but loses the line break which (unless anyone can come up with a way to reintroduce that) makes it less than useless.e.g.\nIE8 test, Chrome/Safari test and another My own tests conclusively show that br tags do not like to be targeted for css.But if you can add style then you can probably also add a scrip tag to the header of the page?\nLink to an external .js that does something like this:So in short, it's not optimal, but here is my solution.this seems to solve the problem:BR is an inline element, not a block element.So, you need:Otherwise, browsers that are a little pickier about such things will refuse to apply borders to your BR elements, since inline elements don't have borders, padding, or margins.UPDATED 9/13/2019:The purpose of styling the <br> tag like this is to make a \"bigger\" line break (i.e., with a bit of extra space between the lines).The \"oldbig\" class (below) was tested and worked properly in Chrome 66.0.3359.181, Firefox Quantum 60.0.2, Edge 42.17134.1.0 and IE 11.48.17134.0, to style . Unfortunately, it broke in Chrome version 76 and its derivatives (circa August 2019). The symptom is that the extra space between lines is no longer displayed.The \"newbig\" class is tested and working properly in current versions of Chrome (76.0.3809.132), Opera, Firefox, Edge, IE, Brave, and Palemoon:Here's a demo:This is the result, displayed in Chrome v.76:This will work, but only in IE.  I tested it in IE8. I placed a <br> tag into a <span> tag and was able to use display:none; on the <span> to control when not to use the <br> tag using Media Queries.old question but this is a pretty neat and clean fix, might come in use for people who are still wondering if it's possible :):with this fix you can also remove BRs on websites ( just set the width to 0px )Why not just use the HR tag?

I have a few doubts as ??? points.Rather than try to target @media rules at specific devices, it is arguably more practical to base them on your particular layout instead. That is, gradually narrow your desktop browser window and observe the natural breakpoints for your content. It's different for every site. As  long as the design flows well at each browser width, it should work pretty reliably on any screen size (and there are lots and lots of them out there.)I've been using:It keeps things relatively simple and allows you to do something a bit different for phones in portrait mode (a lot of the time I find myself having to change various elements for them).I'm using 4 break points but as ralph.m said each site is unique. \nYou should experiment. There are no magic breakpoints due to so many devices, screens, and resolutions.Here is what I use as a template. \nI'm checking the website for each breakpoint on different mobile devices and updating CSS for each element (ul, div, etc.) not displaying correctly for that breakpoint.So far that was working on multiple responsive websites I've made.UPDATEAs per September 2015, I'm using a better one. I find out that these media queries breakpoints match many more devices and desktop screen resolutions.Having all CSS for desktop on style.cssAll media queries on responsive.css: all CSS for responsive menu + media break pointsUpdate 2019: As per Hugo comment below, I removed max-width 1999px because of the new very wide screens.This is from css-tricks linkI can tell you I am using just a single breakpoint at 768 - that is min-width: 768px to serve tablets and desktops, and max-width: 767px to serve phones.I haven't looked back since.

IE< 8 will show mobile css.. sometimes some custom sizes. I don't like bootstrap etc.Instead of using pixels should use em or percentage as it is more adaptive and fluid, better not target devices target your content:HTML5 rockrs read, mobile first Your break points look really good. I've tried 768px on Samsung tablets and it goes beyond that, so I really like the 961px.\nYou don't necessarily need all of them if you use responsive CSS techniques, like % width/max-width for blocks and images (text as well).

The contents of the iframe is not in any shape or form part of your parent page.As others have stated, your options are:The below only works if the iframe content is from the same parent domain.The following jquery script works for me.  Tested on Chrome and IE8.  The inner iframe references a page that is on the same domain as the parent page.In this particular case, I am hiding an element with a specific class in the inner iframe.Basically, you just append a 'style' element to the 'head' of the inner iframe.You cannot change the style of a page displayed in an iframe unless you have direct access and therefore ownership of the source html and/or css files.This is to stop XSS (Cross Site Scripting)An iframe has another scope, so you can't access it to style or to change its content with javascript.It's basically \"another page\".The only thing you can do is to edit its own CSS, because with your global CSS you can't do anything.By using part of SimpleSam5's answer, I achieved this with a few of Tawk's chat iframes (their customization interface is fine but I needed further customizations).In this particular iframe that shows up on mobile devices, I needed to hide the default icon and place one of my background images. I did the following:I do not own any Tawk's domain and this worked for me, thus you may do this even if it's not from the same parent domain (despite Jeremy Becker's comment on Sam's answer).This code uses vanilla JavaScript. It creates a new <style> element. It sets the text content of that element to be a string containing the new CSS. And it appends that element directly to the iframe document's head.If you have control of the page hosting the iframe and the page of the iframe, you can pass a query parameter to the iframe...Here's an example to add a class to the iframe based on whether or not the hosting site is mobile...Adding iFrame:Inside iFrame:I have a blog and I had a lot of trouble finding out how to resize my embedded gist. Post manager only allows you to write text, place images and embed HTML code. Blog layout is responsive itself. It's built with Wix. However, embedded HTML is not. I read a lot about how it's impossible to resize components inside body of generated iFrames. So, here is my suggestion:If you only have one component inside your iFrame, i.e. your gist, you can resize only the gist. Forget about the iFrame.I had problems with viewport, specific layouts to different user agents and this is what solved my problem:The logic is to set gist (or your component) css based on user agent. Make sure to identify your component first, before applying to query selector. Feel free to take a look how responsiveness is working. Perhaps it's changed now, but I have used a separate stylesheet with this element:to successfully style embedded youtube iframes...see the blog posts on this page. give the body of your iframe page an ID (or class if you wish)then, also within the iframe's page, assign a background to that in CSS"},

Many thanks!Remove the float on the left column.At the HTML code, the right column needs to come before the left one.If the right has a float (and a width), and if the left column doesn't have a width and no float, it will be flexible :)Also apply an overflow: hidden and some height (can be auto) to the outer div, so that it surrounds both inner divs.Finally, at the left column, add a width: auto and overflow: hidden, this makes the left column independent from the right one (for example, if you resized the browser window, and the right column touched the left one, without these properties, the left column would run arround the right one, with this properties it remains in its space).Example HTML:CSS:Example here: http://jsfiddle.net/jackJoe/fxWg7/See http://www.alistapart.com/articles/negativemargins/ , this is exactly what you need (example 4 there).Best to avoid placing the right column before the left, simply use a negative right-margin.And be \"responsive\" by including an @media setting so the right column falls under the left on narrow screens.Simplest and most flexible solution so far it to use table display:HTML, left div comes first, right div comes second ... we read and write left to right, so it won't make any sense to place the divs right to leftCSS:Cases examples:I'd like to suggest a yet-unmentioned solution: use CSS3's calc() to mix % and px units. calc() has excellent support nowadays, and it allows for fast construction of quite complex layouts.Here's a JSFiddle link for the code below. HTML:CSS:And here's another JSFiddle demonstrating this concept applied to a more complex layout. I used SCSS here since its variables allow for flexible and self-descriptive code, but the layout can be easily re-created in pure CSS if having \"hard-coded\" values is not an issue.This is a generic, HTML source ordered solution where:Fixed/Second Column on RightFixed/Second Column on LeftAlternate solution is to use display: table-cell; which results in equal height columns.Hey, What you can do is apply a fixed width to both the containers and then use another div class where clear:both, like place a the clear div under left and right container.I have simplified it : I have edited jackjoe's answer.

There is however a solution I found:Forwarding Mouse Events Through LayersThis uses a plugin that uses some not well known/understood properties of Javascript to take the mouse event and send it to another element.There is also another Javascript solution here.Update for October 2013: apparently it's coming to IE in v11. Source. Thanks Tim.Here is another solution that is  very easy to implement with 5 lines of code:Example:There's a workaround for IE - use inline SVG and set pointer-events=\"none\" in SVG.\nSee my answer in How to make Internet Explorer emulate pointer-events:none?It's worth mentioning that specifically for IE, disabled=disabled works for anchor tags:IE treats this as an disabled element and does not trigger click event. However, disabled is not a valid attribute on an anchor tag. Hence this won't work in other browsers. For them pointer-events:none is required in the styling.UPDATE 1: So adding following rule feels like a cross-browser solution to me\n\nUPDATE 2: For further compatibility,  because IE will not form styles for anchor tags with disabled='disabled', so they will still look active. Thus, a:hover{} rule and styling is a good idea:\n Working on Chrome, IE11, and IE8.\nOf course, above CSS assumes anchor tags are rendered with disabled=\"disabled\"Here's a small script implementing this feature (inspired by the Shea Frederick blog article that Kyle mentions):Cover the offending elements with an invisible block, using a pseudo element: :before or :afterThus you're click lands on the parent element. No good, if the parent is clickable, but works well otherwise.I spent almost two days on finding the solution for this problem and I found this at last.This uses javascript and jquery.(GitHub) pointer_events_polyfillThis could use a javascript plug-in to be downloaded/copied.\nJust copy/download the codes from that site and save it as pointer_events_polyfill.js. Include that javascript to your site.<script src=\"JS/pointer_events_polyfill.js></script>Add this jquery scripts to your siteAnd don't forget to include your jquery plug-in.It works! I can click elements under the transparent element. I'm using IE 10. I hope this can also work in IE 9 and below.EDIT: Using this solution does not work when you click the textboxes below the transparent element. To solve this problem, I use focus when the user clicks on the textbox.Javascript:JQuery:This lets you type the text into the textbox.I've found another solution to solve this problem. I use jQuery to set the href-attribute to javascript:; (not ' ', or the browser will reload the page) if the browser window width is greater than 1'000px. You need to add an ID to your link. Here's what I'm doing:Maybe it's useful for you.Use OnClientClick = \"return false;\" You can also just \"not\" add a url inside the <a> tag, i do this for menus that are <a> tag driven with drop downs as well.  If there is not drop down then i add the url but if there are drop downs with a <ul> <li> list i just remove it.I faced similar issues:If a normal cursor is needed you could add cursor:defaultBest solution:Runs perfectly on all browsers"},

Instead, what you get is a very small and somewhat annoying increment in the position of the scrollbar.Tested: 4 versions of Firefox (100% affected), 4 versions of Chrome (50% affected).Here's my jsfiddle. You can get around this with by having an on/off (true/false) var that allows only one onScroll() event to trigger at a time:Problem Behavior With Accepted Answer :Actually Desired Behavior :So, just why does this happen? If you run through the code, you'll see that wrapper1 calls wrapper2's scrollLeft, and wrapper2 calls wrapper1's scrollLeft, and repeat this infinitely, so, we have an infinite loop problem.  Or, rather: the continued scrolling of the user conflicts with wrapperx's call of the scrolling, an event conflict occurs, and the end result is no jumping in the scrollbars.Hope this helps someone else out!Based on @StanleyH solution I created an AngularJS directive, demo on jsFiddle.Easy to use:No jQuery required.Linking the scrollers worked, but in the way it's written it creates a loop which makes scrolling slow in most browsers if you click on the part of the lighter scrollbar and hold it (not when dragging the scroller).I fixed it with a flag:As far as I'm aware this isn't possible with HTML and CSS.In vanilla Javascript/Angular you can do this like this:HTML:CSS:Expanding on StanleyH's answer, and trying to find the minimum required, here is what I implemented:JavaScript (called once from somewhere like $(document).ready()):HTML (note that the widths will change the scroll bar length):That's it.a javascript only solution that's based on @HoldOffHunger and @bobince answers.If you are using iscroll.js on webkit browser or mobile browser, you could try:to all angular/nativeJs fans, implementing @simo's answerHTML (no change)CSS (no change, width: 90% is my desing)JS (like onload) or ngAfterViewChecked (all the as are for TypeScript)There is an issue with scroll direction: rtl.

More info on Bootstrap documentation.Edit: The original question was for Bootstrap 2.x, but the same is still valid for Bootstrap 3 and Bootstrap 4.In Bootstrap 4 you will need to add appropriate margin to your groups using utility classes, such as mx-2.Just put the buttons in a class ( class=\"btn-toolbar\" ) as told by bro Miroslav Popovic.It works awesome.You can use spacing for Bootstrap and no need for any additional CSS. Just add the classes to your buttons. This is for version 4.you should use bootstrap v.4The easiest way in most situations is margin.Where you can do :ORWhat Dragan B suggested is right way to go for Bootstrap 4. I have put one example below. e.g. mr-3 is margin-right:1rem!importantp.s: in my case I wanted my buttons to be displayed to the right of the screen and hence pull-right. I used the Bootstrap 4 buttons plugin (https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/components/buttons/#button-plugin)\nand added the class rounded to the labels and the class mx-1 to the middle button to achieve the desired look and feel of separate radio buttons. Using the class btn-toolbar made the radio button circles appear for me which is not what I wanted. Hope this helps someone. Another way to achieve this is to add a class .btn-space in your buttonsand define this class as followsI actual ran into the same requirement. I simply used CSS override like thisif use Bootstrap, you can change with style like: If you want only in one page, then betwen head tags add     .btn-group btn{margin-right:1rem;}If is for all the web site add to css fileI ended up doing something similar to what mark dibe did, but I needed to figure out the spacing for a slightly different manner.The col-x classes in bootstrap can be an absolute lifesaver. I ended up doing something similar to this:This allowed me to align titles and input switches in a nicely spaced manner. The same idea can be applied to the buttons and allow you to stop the buttons from touching.(Side note: I wanted this to be a comment on the above link, but my reputation is not high enough)"},

It would look much better without text field, if it's possible.This will surely work i have used it in my projects.I hope this helps :)I was having a heck of a time trying to accomplish this. I didn't want to use a Flash solution, and none of the jQuery libraries I looked at were reliable across all browsers.I came up with my own solution, which is implemented completely in CSS (except for the onclick style change to make the button appear 'clicked').You can try a working example here: http://jsfiddle.net/VQJ9V/307/ (Tested in FF 7, IE 9, Safari 5, Opera 11 and Chrome 14)It works by creating a big file input (with font-size:50px), then wrapping it in a div that has a fixed size and overflow:hidden. The input is then only visible through this \"window\" div. The div can be given a background image or color, text can be added, and the input can be made transparent to reveal the div background:HTML:CSS:Let me know if there are any problems with it and I'll try to fix them.I wasted my day today getting this to work. I found none of the solutions here working each of my scenarios. Then I remembered I saw an example for the JQuery File Upload without text box. So what I did is that I took their example and stripped it down to the relevant part.This solution at least works for IE and FF and can be fully styled. In the below example the file input is hidden under the fancy \"Add Files\" button.Hide the input-file element and create a visible button that will trigger the click event of that input-file.Try this:CSSHTML:JAVASCRIPT(jQuery):Hide the input file tag with css, add a label and assign it to input button. label will be clickable and when clicked, it will fire up the file dialog.Add the style to the label as a button.\nLive DemoThat's going to be very hard. The problem with the file input type is that it usually consists of two visual elements, while being treated as a single DOM-element. Add to that that several browsers have their own distinct look and feel for the file input, and you're set for nightmare. See this article on quirksmode.org about the quirks the file input has. I guarantee you it won't make you happy (I speak from experience).[EDIT]Actually, I think you might get away with putting your input in a container element (like a div), and adding a negative margin to the element. Effectively hiding the textbox part off screen.\nAnother option would be to use the technique in the article I linked, to try to style it like a button.Fix to work in all browsers\nRESOLVED:I have tested in FF, Chrome & IE - working fine, applied styles too :DI tried to implement the top two solutions, and it ended up being a HUGE waste of time for me.  In the end, applying this .css class solved the problem...Done!  super clean and super simple...Another easy way of doing this. Make a \"input type file\" tag in html and hide it. Then click a button and format it according to need. After this use javascript/jquery to programmatically click the input tag when the button is clicked.HTML :-JavaScript :-jQuery :-CSS :-Here is a working JS fiddle for the same :- http://jsfiddle.net/32na3/I used some of the code recommended above and after many hours of waisting my time, I eventually came to a css bag free solution.You can run it over here - http://jsfiddle.net/WqGph/but then found a better solution - http://jsfiddle.net/XMMc4/5/Here is my good ol' remedy:At least it worked in Safari.Plain and simple.You could label an image so when you click on it the click event of the button will be triggered. You can simply make the normal button invisible:It worked for me on all browsers, and is very easy to use.You can dispatch the click event on a hidden file input like this:HTML:JQUERYHope this works :)You can give the input element a font opacity of 0. This will hide the text field without hiding the 'Choose Files' button.No javascript required, clear cross browser as far back as IE 9E.g.,     Ive a really hacky solution with this...The problem is the width attribute that is hiding the text field will obvously vary between browsers, vary between Windows XP themes and so on. Maybe its something you can work with though?...I know this is an old post but a simple way to make the text dissapear is just to set text color to that of your background.eg if your text input background is white then:This will not effect the Choose File text which will still be black due to the browser.This works for me:my solution is just to set it within a div like \"druveen\" said, however i ad my own button style to the div (make it look like a button with a:hover) and i just set the style \"opacity:0;\" to the input. Works a charm for me, hope it does the same for you.I just styled an input file with width: 85px, and the text field disappeared at allThis HTML code show up only Upload File buttonFor me, the simplest way is using a font color like background color. Simple, not elegant, but usefull.So here's the best way to do this FOR ALL BROWSERS:Forget CSS!All these answers are cute, but CSS won't work since it isn't the same across all browsers and devices, the first answer I wrote will work in everything but Safari. To get it to work accross all browsers all the time it must be created dynamically and recreated every time you want to clear the input text:The answer of tmanthey is quite good, except that you can't play with border-width in Firefox v20. If you see the link (demo, can't really show here) they solved the problem using font-size=23px, transform:translate(-300px, 0px) scale(4) for Firefox to get the button bigger.\nOther solutions using .click() on a different div is useless if you want to make it a drag'n'drop input box.There are several valid options here but thought I would give what I have come up with while trying to fix a similar issue.  http://jsfiddle.net/5RyrG/1/ Resolved with the following code:<div style=\"overflow: hidden;width:83px;\">\n   <input style='float:right;' name=\"userfile\" id=\"userfile\" type=\"file\"/>\n</div>I wrote this:Work fine in all browsers, no jQuery, no CSS. Here is a simplified version of @ampersandre's popular solution that works in all major browsers.\nAsp.NET markupJQuery Codecss codeUses a hidden \"UploadButton\" click trigger for server postback with standard . The  with \"Upload File\" text pushes the input control out of view in the wrapper div when it overflows so there is no need to apply any styles for the \"file input\" control div.

Then change it to size=\"100\" -- see what I mean?I suspect there's a better solution, but the only one that comes to mind is something I found on the \"Hidden features of HTML\" question on SO: Use a content-editable div, instead of an input. Passing the user input to the enclosing form (if that's what you need to) might be a little tricky.Hidden features of HTMLYour best bet is to wrap the input in a div with your border, margins, etc., and have the input inside with width 100% and no border, no margins, etc.For example,You could fake it, like this:Try this:Also you could fake it, like this:Add this to your style:"},

For example, select all <div> with a child <span>.Possible?Unfortunately not yet.The CSS2 and CSS3 selector specifications do not allow for any sort of parent selection.This is a disclaimer about the accuracy of this post from this point onward. Parent selectors in CSS have been discussed for many years. As no consensus has been found, changes keep happening. I will attempt to keep this answer up-to-date, however be aware that there may be inaccuracies due to changes in the specifications.An older \"Selectors Level 4 Working Draft\" described a feature which was the ability to specify the \"subject\" of a selector. This feature has been dropped and will not be available for CSS implementations.The subject was going to be the element in the selector chain that would have styles applied to it.This selector would style the span elementThis selector would style the p elementA more recent \"Selectors Level 4 Editor’s Draft\" includes \"The Relational Pseudo-class: :has()\":has() would allow an author to select an element based on its contents. My understanding is it was chosen to provide compatibility with jQuery's custom :has() pseudo-selector*.In any event, continuing the example from above, to select the p element that contains a span one could use:* This makes me wonder if jQuery had implemented selector subjects whether subjects would have remained in the specification.Update 2019The :has() pseudo-selector is propsed in the CSS Selectors 4 spec, and will address this use case once implemented.To use it, we will write something like:In a structure like:This CSS will target the .bar div - because it both has a parent .foo and from its position in the DOM, > .baz resolves to a valid element target.Original Answer (left for historical purposes) - this portion is no longer accurateFor completeness, I wanted to point out that in the Selectors 4 specification (currently in proposal), this will become possible. Specifically, we will gain Subject Selectors, which will be used in the following format:The ! before the div selector indicates that it is the element to be styled, rather than the span. Unfortunately, no modern browsers (as of the time of this posting) have implemented this as part of their CSS support. There is, however, support via a JavaScript library called Sel, if you want to go down the path of exploration further.I agree that it is not possible in general.The only thing CSS3 can do (which helped in my case) is to select elements that have no children:Or have any children (including text):"},

Could someone please explain these lines to me or give me a source where I could learn to implement lines like these?These are the vendor-prefixed properties offered by the relevant rendering engines (-webkit for Chrome, Safari; -moz for Firefox, -o for Opera, -ms for Internet Explorer). Typically they're used to implement new, or proprietary CSS features, prior to final clarification/definition by the W3.This allows properties to be set specific to each individual browser/rendering engine in order for inconsistencies between implementations to be safely accounted for. The prefixes will, over time, be removed (at least in theory) as the unprefixed, the final version, of the property is implemented in that browser.To that end it's usually considered good practice to specify the vendor-prefixed version first and then the non-prefixed version, in order that the non-prefixed property will override the vendor-prefixed property-settings once it's implemented; for example:Specifically, to address the CSS in your question, the lines you quote:Specify the column-count, column-gap and column-fill properties for Webkit browsers and Firefox.References:What are -moz- and -webkit-?CSS properties starting with -webkit-, -moz-, -ms- or -o- are called vendor prefixes. Why do different browsers add different prefixes for the same effect?  A good explanation of vendor prefixes comes from Peter-Paul Koch of QuirksMode:UPDATE AS OF THE YEAR 2016As this post 3 years old, it's important to mention that now most vendors do understand that these prefixes are just creating un-necessary duplicate code and that the situation where you need to specify 3 different CSS rules to get one effect working in all browser is an unwanted one.As mentioned in this glossary about Mozilla's view on Vendor Prefix on May 3, 2016,For example, just a few years ago, to set a rounded corner on a box you had to write:But now that browsers have come to fully support this feature, you really only need the standardized version:Finding the right rules for all browsersAs still there's no standard for common CSS rules that work on all browsers, you can use tools like caniuse.com to check support of a rule across all major browsers.You can also use pleeease.io/play.

So it works with Opera and not in Chrome or FF... any ideas?Chrome cannot resize horizontally below 400px (OS X) or 218px (Windows) but I have a really simple solution to the problem:Update: Chrome now allows you to arrange the inspector windows vertically when docked to the right! This really improves the layout.The HTML and CSS panels fit really well and you even open a small console panel too. \nThis has allowed me to completely move from Firefox/Firebug to Chrome.If you want to go a step further look at the web inspector settings (cog icon, bottom-right), and goto the user agent tab. You can set the screen resolution to whatever you like here and even quickly toggle between portrait and landscape.UPDATE: Here is another really cool tool I've come across. http://lab.maltewassermann.com/viewport-resizer/this may be because of the addons you installed on your browser. remove or hide all addon icons from the tool bar and try re size. when there are addons browser only resize the address bar and keeps the addons visible.Update: 7/14/2013With the latest chrome version, now you can re-size the address bar and it will hide the addons automatically. I was stumped as well but ended up with a simple solution.  I just created a HTML file with a link to open a new window:This new window has nothing but the address bar and Chrome lets me freely resize this down to 111x80.nayan9's solution works great, and can be put into a bookmark without having to create a html file. In Chrome, create a new bookmark with URL:And give it a name of \"Open Small Window\" or something similar. This will allow you to easily open windows without size restrictions within chrome. Note that just copying this into your address bar won't work - chrome strips the \"javascript:\" out.In case you want to reduce your screen width to emulate different devices (and why else would you want to do this?):Chrome now has an Emulation section in its inspector, activated by clicking the little phone icon in the top menubar (between the magnifying glass and Elements):Emulation mode allows you to set the viewport size to all common mobile screen sizes, among other nice features, like emulating touch, geolocation and even accelerometer input:Adding to what nayan9 and drinkdecaf said, you can just throw document.URL into the call to window.open to see the page you're currently viewing in the 320 window. You might want to add some more to the width if you're expecting a scrollbar.The DevTools in Chrome have moved on substantially from when most of these answers were posted. The best way to address this issue now is to use the emulators that are built into Chrome.To use the emulators open DevTools (press F12) and then click on the following icon to toggle the Device Toolbar:This will then allow you to emulate whichever mobile device or viewport size you want to.in chrome the icons of your addons in the top right corner cause the problem -> resize the adress-bar (where you type the urls) to maximum width (drag the bar at the right edge to the right)or disable the iconsI am lazy, to make it even easier, let the bookmarklet ask the user for sizes :-DI found a quick workaround for this. Just install the Responsive Web Design Add-on to Chrome, and it will open a separate window without the address bar and tabs, which can be scaled down to 10 px or less. Link here: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/responsive-web-design-tes/bdpelkpfhjfiacjeobkhlkkgaphbobea/relatedI've been experiencing similar issues and just found a good work around.  Open up your chrome devtools and in the top left, there's a little screen and ipad icon.  Click that and it opens a mobile view of your page.  You can set it to predefined devices or a custom resolution.  Pretty nifty actually.Another easy solution is to click Strg+Shift+N to enter Incognito Mode. There you can resize your Browser window as you like.I like this tool because it lets you switch quickly and also switches between portrait/horizontal easily for mobile sizes. It also allows you to make a personalized bookmark let, so if you design for obscure resolutions frequently, you can save them and use them.I had to use one of these tools because even with the above answer I couldn't get my window to scale to 320 properly, this tool seems to be a faster solution overall.http://lab.maltewassermann.com/viewport-resizer/I'm always running into this issue with pinned tabs. Chrome will not resize below a horizontal width of eight visible pinned tabs if there are any! Just detach the tab that you want to resize to solve this ...A lot of smart phones scale the page to fit into their screen size using zooming.  Your minimum page width is probably 400px.  Without any example code, I think that's all that can be said."},

However, when I add a nested div and set height: 100%;, it doesn't stretch to container's height. Is there a way to fix it?This is a reported webkit (chrome/safari) bug, children of parents with min-height can't inherit the height property: https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=26559 Apparently Firefox is affected too (can't test in IE at the moment)Possible workaround:The bug doesn't show when the inner element has absolute positioning.See http://jsfiddle.net/xrebB/Edit on April 10, 2014Since I'm currently working on a project for which I really need parent containers with min-height, and child elements inheriting the height of the container, I did some more research.First: I'm not so sure anymore whether the current browser behaviour really is a bug. CSS2.1 specs say: If I put a min-height on my container, I'm not explicitly specifying its height - so my element should get an auto height. And that's exactly what Webkit - and all other browsers - do.Second, the workaround I found:If I set my container element to display:table with height:inherit it acts exactly the same way as if I'd give it a min-height of 100%. And - more importantly - if I set the child element to display:table-cell it will perfectly inherit the height of the container element - whether it's 100% or more.Full CSS:The markup:See http://jsfiddle.net/xrebB/54/.Add height: 1px to parent container. Works in Chrome, FF, Safari.thought I would share this, as I didnt see this anywhere, and is what I used to fix my solution.SOLUTION: min-height: inherit;I had a parent with a specified min height, and I needed a child to also be that height.This way the child now acts as height 100% of the min-height. I hope some people find this useful :)This was added in a comment by @jackocnr but I missed it. For modern browsers I think this is the best approach.It makes the inner element fill the whole container if it's too small, but expands the container's height if it's too big.Kushagra Gour's solution does work (at least in Chrome and IE) and solves the original problem without having to use display: table; and display: table-cell;. See plunker: http://plnkr.co/edit/ULEgY1FDCsk8yiRTfOWUSetting min-height: 100%; height: 1px; on the outer div causes its actual height to be at least 100%, as required. It also allows the inner div to correctly inherit the height. In addition to the existing answers, there is also viewport units vh to use. Simple snippet below. Of course it can be used together with calc() as well, e.g. min-height: calc(100vh - 200px); when page header and footer have 200px height together.I don't believe this is a bug with browsers. All behave the same way - that is, once you stop specifying explicit heights, min-height is basically a \"last step\".It appears to be exactly how the CSS 2.1 spec suggests:\nhttp://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/visudet.html#the-height-propertyTherefore, as the min-height parent does not have an explicit height property set, it defaults to auto.There are some ways around this possibly by using display: table-cell, or newer styles such as flexbox, if that is possible for your targeted audience's browsers. You can also subvert this in certain situations by using the top and bottom properties on an absolutely positioned inner element, which gives you 100% height without specifying so.For googlers:This jquery-workaround makes #containment get a height automatically (by, height: auto), then gets the actual height assigned as a pixel value.Although display: flex; has been suggested here, consider using display: grid; now that it's widely supported. By default, the only child of a grid will entirely fill its parent.The best way to achieve this nowadays is to use display: flex;. However you might run into an issue when trying to support IE11. According to https://caniuse.com using flexbox :The solution is to use display: table; on the parent and display: table-row; on the child both with height: 100%; as a replacement for min-height: 100%;.Most of the solutions listed here use display: table, table-row and/or table-cell, but they don't replicate the same behaviour as min-height: 100%;, which is:While using this solution, the behaviour is the same and the property min-height is not needed which allows to get around the bug.The reason why it works is because, unlike most elements, elements using display: table and table-row will always be as tall as their content. This makes their height property behave similarly to min-height.Another JS solution, that is easy and can be used to avoid a non-easy CSS-only or extra markup / hacky solution.W/ jQuery :Angular directive :To be used like this :Just to keep this subject complete, I found a solution not explored Here using Fixed position.This usually works for me:This is what works for me with percentage-based height and parent still growing according to children height.\nWorks fine in Firefox, Chrome and Safari.after trying for ours! chrome understands that I want the child element to be 100% height when I set the display value to inline block. btw setting float will causing it.updatethis is not working. the solution is to get the parentnode offsetheight and use it at the and of the page with javascript.

His solution is my favourite, but I always had problem with indentation when the li had more than one line. It was fiddly to find the correct indentation with margins etc. But this might concern only me.For me absolute positioning of the :before pseudo-element works best. I set padding-left on ul, negative position left on the :before element, same as ul's padding-left. To get the distance of the content from the :before element right I just set the padding-left on the li. Of course the li has to have position relative.

SEVERITY: I see this problem on even the most major sites, especially on German sites where even common words such as \"speed limit\" are very long (\"Geschwindigkeitsbegrenzung\"). Does anyone have a workable solution to this?You can tell browsers where to split long words by inserting soft hyphen (&shy;):may be rendered asorA nice regular expression can ensure you won't be inserting them unless neccessary:Browsers and search engines are smart enough to ignore this character when searching text, and Chrome and Firefox (haven't tested others) ignore it when copying text to clipboard.Another option is to inject <wbr>, a former IE-ism, which is now in HTML5:Breaks with no hyphen:You can achieve the same with zero-width space character &#8203; (or &#x200B).FYI there's also CSS hyphens: auto supported by latest IE, Firefox and Safari (but currently not Chrome):However that hyphenation is based on a hyphenation dictionary and it's not guaranteed to break long words. It can make justified text prettier though.<table> for layout is bad, but display:table on other elements is fine. It will be as quirky (and stretchy) as old-school tables:overflow and white-space: pre-wrap answers below are good too.Two fixes:If (in the SO example) you want to stop it overlapping the padding, you'd probably have to create another div, inside the padding, to hold your content.Edit: As the other answers state, there are a variety of methods for truncating the words, be that working out the render width on the client side (never attempt to do this server-side as it will never work reliably, cross platform) through JS and inserting break-characters, or using non-standard and/or wildly incompatible CSS tags (word-wrap: break-word doesn't appear to work in Firefox).You will always need an overflow descriptor though. If your div contains another too-wide block-type piece of content (image, table, etc), you'll need overflow to make it not destroy the layout/design.So by all means use another method (or a combination of them) but remember to add overflow too so you cover all browsers.Edit 2 (to address your comment below):Start off using the CSS overflow property isn't perfect but it stops designs breaking. Apply overflow:hidden first. Remember that overflow might not break on padding so either nest divs or use a border (whatever works best for you).This will hide overflowing content and therefore you might lose meaning. You could use a scrollbar (using overflow:auto or overflow:scroll instead of overflow:hidden) but depending on the dimensions of the div, and your design, this might not look or work great.To fix it, we can use JS to pull things back and do some form of automated truncation. I was half-way through writing out some pseudo code for you but it gets seriously complicated about half-way through. If you need to show as much as possible, give hyphenator a look in (as mentioned below).Just be aware that this comes at the cost of user's CPUs. It could result in pages taking a long time to load and/or resize.This is a complex issue, as we know, and not supported in any common way between browsers. Most browsers don't support this feature natively at all.In some work done with HTML emails, where user content was being used, but script is not available (and even CSS is not supported very well) the following bit of CSS in a wrapper around your unspaced content block should at least help somewhat:In the case of Mozilla-based browsers, the XBL file mentioned above contains:Unfortunately, Opera 8+ don't seem to like any of the above solutions, so JavaScript will have to be the solution for those browsers (like Mozilla/Firefox.)

I know it works on tables. Do you mean that, in browsers that support it, word-wrap: break-word does not work ?If included in the body definition of the stylesheet, it should works throughout the entire document.If overflow is not a good solution, only a custom javascript could artificially break up long word.Note: there is also this <wbr> Word Break tag. This gives the browser a spot where it can split the line up. Unfortunately, the <wbr> tag doesn't work in all browsers, only Firefox and Internet Explorer (and Opera with a CSS trick).Just checked IE 7, Firefox 3.6.8 Mac, Firefox 3.6.8 Windows, and Safari:works for long links inside of a div with a set width and no overflow declared in the css:I don't see any incompatibility issuesI just found out about hyphenator from this question. That might solve the problem.After much fighting, this is what worked for me:Works in the latest versions of Chrome, Firefox and Opera.Note that I excluded many of the white-space properties the others suggested -- that actually broke the pre indentation for me.For me on a div without fixed size and with dynamic content it worked using:Re the regex in this comment, it's good, but it adds the shy hyphen only between groups of 5 non-whitespace-or-hyphen chars. That allows the last group be much longer than intended, since there's no matching group after it.For instance, this:...results in this:Here's a version using positive lookahead to avoid that problem:...with this result:The solution I usually use for this problem is to set 2 different css rules for IE and other browsers:woks perfect in IE, but word-wrap is not a standard CSS property. It's a Microsoft specific property and doesn't work in Firefox.For Firefox, the best thing to do using only CSS is to set the rulefor the element that contains the text you want to wrap. It doesn't wrap the text, but hide the part of text that go over the limit of the container. It can be a nice solution if is not essential for you to display all the text (i.e. if the text is inside an <a> tag)Update: Handling this in CSS is wonderfully simple and low overhead, but you have no control over where breaks occur when they do. That's fine if you don't care, or your data has long alphanumeric runs without any natural breaks. We had lots of long file paths, URLs, and phone numbers, all of which have places it's significantly better to break at than others.Our solution was to first use a regex replacement to put a zero-width space (&#8203;) after every 15 (say) characters that aren't whitespace or one of the special characters where we'd prefer breaks. We then do another replacement to put a zero-width space after those special characters.Zero-width spaces are nice, because they aren't ever visible on screen; shy hyphens were confusing when they showed, because the data has significant hyphens. Zero-width spaces also aren't included when you copy text out of the browser.  The special break characters we're currently using are period, forward slash, backslash, comma, underscore, @, |, and hyphen. You wouldn't think you'd need do anything to encourage breaking after hyphens, but Firefox (3.6 and 4 at least) doesn't break by itself at hyphens surrounded by numbers (like phone numbers).We also wanted to control the number of characters between artificial breaks, based on the layout space available. That meant that the regex to match long non-breaking runs needed to be dynamic. This gets called a lot, and we didn't want to be creating the same identical regexes over and over for performance reasons, so we used a simple regex cache, keyed by the regex expression and its flags.Here's the code; you'd probably namespace the functions in a utility package:Test like this:Update 2: It appears that zero-width spaces in fact are included in copied text in at least some circumstances, you just can't see them. Obviously, encouraging people to copy text with hidden characters in it is an invitation to have data like that entered into other programs or systems, even your own, where it may cause problems. For instance, if it ends up in a database, searches against it may fail, and search strings like this are likely to fail too. Using arrow keys to move through data like this requires (rightly) an extra keypress to move across the character you can't see, somewhat bizarre for users if they notice.In a closed system, you can filter that character out on input to protect yourself, but that doesn't help other programs and systems.All told, this technique works well, but I'm not certain what the best choice of break-causing character would be.Update 3: Having this character end up in data is no longer a theoretical possibility, it's an observed problem. Users submit data copied off the screen, it gets saved in the db, searches break, things sort weirdly etc.. We did two things:This works well, as does the technique itself, but it's a cautionary tale.Update 4: We're using this in a context where the data fed to this may be HTML escaped. Under the right circumstances, it can insert zero-width spaces in the middle of HTML entities, with funky results.Fix was to add ampersand to the list of characters we don't break on, like this:Need to set \"table-layout: fixed” for word-wrap to workUPDATE: \nAs of December, 2011, we now have another option, with the emerging support of these tags in FF and Safari:I've done some basic testing and it seems to work on a recent version of Mobile Safari and Safari 5.1.1.Compatibility table: https://developer.mozilla.org/en/CSS/hyphens#AutoCompatibilityTableFor compatibility with IE 8+ use:See it here http://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/prevent-long-urls-from-breaking-out-of-container/All I had to do was apply this to the style of the div container with a set width.Use thisIf you have this -just switch to a vertical format with containing divs and use min-width in your CSS instead of width -Of course, if you are displaying genuine tabular data it is ok to use a real table as it is semantically correct and will inform people using screen readers that is supposed to be in a table. It is using them for general layout or image-slicing that people will lynch you for.I had to do the following because, if the properties were not declared in the correct order, it would randomly break words at the wrong place and without adding a hyphen.

That way you can be sure that there is even a line-break after a single letter.

Finally I came to a conclusion that giving word-spacing a very huge value works perfectly fine.or, for the modern browsers you can use the CSS vw unit (visual width in % of the screen size).An alternative solution is described on Separate sentence to one word per line, by applying display:table-caption; to the elementTry using white-space: pre-line;. It creates a line-break wherever a line-break appears in the code, but ignores the extra whitespace (tabs and spaces etc.).First, write your words on separate lines in your code: Then apply the style to the element containing the words.Be careful though, every line break in the code inside the element will create a line break. So writing the following will result in an extra line break before the first word and after the last word:There's a great article on CSS Tricks explaining the other white-space attributes.If you want to be able to choose from different solutions, in addition to the given answers...An alternative method is to give the container a width of 0 and to make sure overflow is visible. Then each word will overflow out of it and will be on its own line.Or you can use one of those newly proposed width values, provided those still exist by the time you read this.You can't target each word in CSS. However, with a bit of jQuery you probably could.With jQuery you can wrap each word in a <span> and then CSS set span to display:block which would put it on its own line.In theory of course :PI faced the same problem, and none of the options here helped me. Some mail services do not support specified styles.\nHere is my version, which solved the problem and works everywhere I checked:OR using CSS:The best solution is the word-spacing property. Add the <p> in a container with a specific size (example 300px) and after you have to add that size as the value in the word-spacing.HTMLCSSIn this way, your sentence will be always broken and set in a column, but the with of the paragraph will be dynamic.Here an example Codepenhttps://jsfiddle.net/bm3Lfcod/1/For those seeking for a solution that works within a flexible parent container with a children that is flexible in both dimensions. eg. navbar buttons.In my case,worked perfecly, hope it helps any other newcomer like me."},

Including input[readonly=\"readonly\"] is redundant. See https://stackoverflow.com/a/19645203/1766230Loads of answers here, but haven't seen the one I use:Note the dash in the pseudo selector. If the input is readonly=\"false\" it'll catch that too since this selector catches the presence of readonly regardless of the value. Technically false is invalid according to specs, but the internet is not a perfect world. If you need to cover that case, you can do this:textarea works the same way:Keep in mind that html now supports not only type=\"text\", but a slew of other textual types such a number, tel, email, date, time, url, etc. Each would need to be added to the selector.There are a few ways to do this.The first is the most widely used. It works on all major browsers.While the one above will select all inputs with readonly attached, this one below will select only what you desire. Make sure to replace demo with whatever input type you want.This is an alternate to the first, but it's not used a whole lot:The :read-only selector is supported in Chrome, Opera, and Safari. Firefox uses :-moz-read-only. IE doesn't support the :read-only selector.You can also use input[readonly=\"readonly\"], but this is pretty much the same as input[readonly], from my experience.Shoud cover all the cases for a readonly input field...If you select the input by the id and then add the input[readonly=\"readonly\"] tag in the css, something like:That will not work.

If your .css file is in a location separate from the page code, the actual font file should have the same path as the .css file, NOT the .html or .php web page file. Then the web page needs something like:in the <head> section of your html page. In this example, the font file should be located in the css folder along with the stylesheet. After this, simply add the class=\"junebug\" inside any tag in your html to use Junebug font in that element.If you're putting the css in the actual web page, add the style tag in the head of the html like:And the actual element style can either be included in the above <style> and called per element by class or id, or you can just declare the style inline with the element. By element I mean <div>, <p>, <h1> or any other element within the html that needs to use the Junebug font. With both of these options, the font file (Junebug.ttf) should be located in the same path as the html page. Of these two options, the best practice would look like:andAnd the least acceptable way would be:andThe reason it's not good to use inline styles is best practice dictates that styles should be kept all in one place so editing is practical. This is also the main reason that I recommend using the very first option of using external style sheets. I hope this helps.there is a simple way to do this:\nin the html file add:Note: you put the name of .ttf file you have.\nthen go to to your css file and add:Note: you put the font family name of the font you have.Note: do not write the font-family name as your font.ttf name\nexample: if your font.ttf name is: \"vermin_vibes.ttf\" your font-family will be: \"vermin vibes\" font family doesn't contain special chars as \"-,_\"...etc it only can contain spaces."},

You will have to set the height of the inner table with Java Script, the rest is CSS.I found DataTables to be quite flexible. While its default version is based on jquery, there is also an AngularJs plugin.I saw Sean Haddy's excellent solution to a similar question and took the liberty of making some edits:Sean did the heavy lifting, though. Thanks to Matt Burland, too, for pointing out need to support tfoot.Please see for yourself at http://jsfiddle.net/jhfrench/eNP2N/Have you tried using thead and tbody, and setting a fixed height on tbody with overflow:scroll?What are your target browsers?EDIT: It worked well (almost) in firefox - the addition of the vertical scrollbar caused the need for a horizontal scrollbar as well - yuck.  IE just set the height of each td to what I had specifed the height of tbody to be.  Here's the best I could come up with:What you need is :1) have a table body of limited height as scroll occurs only when contents is bigger than the scrolling window. However tbody cannot be sized, and you have to display it as a block to do so:2) Re-sync table header and table body columns widths as making the latter a block made it an unrelated element. The only way to do so is to simulate synchronization by enforcing the same columns width to both. However, since tbody itself is a block now, it can no longer behave like a table. Since you still need a table behavior to display you columns correctly, the solution is to ask for each of your rows to display as individual tables:(Note that, using this technique, you won't be able to span across rows anymore).Once that done, you can enforce column widths to have the same width in both thead and tbody. You could not that:I prefer the last option, which requires adding:See a demo here, forked from the answer to this question.Edit:   This is a very old answer and is here for prosperity just to show that it was supported once back in the 2000's but dropped because browsers strategy in the 2010's was to respect W3C specifications even if some features were removed: Scrollable table with fixed header/footer was clumsily specified before HTML5.Unfortunately there is no elegant way to handle scrollable table with fixed thead/tfoot \nbecause HTML/CSS specifications are not very clear about that feature.Although HTML 4.01 Specification says thead/tfoot/tbody are used (introduced?) to scroll table body: But the working scrollable table feature on FF 3.6 has been removed in FF 3.7 because considered as a bug because not compliant with HTML/CSS specifications. See this and that comments on FF bugs.Below is a simplified version of the MDN useful tips for scrollable table\nsee this archived page or the current French versionHowever MDN also says this does not work any more on FF :-( \nI have also tested on IE8 => table is not scrollable either :-((Not sure if anyone is still looking at this but they way I have done this previously is to use two tables to display the single original table - the first just the original table title line and no table body rows (or an empty body row to make it validate).The second is in a separate div and has no title and just the original table body rows. The separate div is then made scrollable.The second table in it's div is placed just below the first table in the HTML and it looks like a single table with a fixed header and a scrollable lower section. I have only tested this in Safari, Firefox and IE (latest versions of each in Spring 2010) but it worked in all of them.The only issue it had was that the first table would not validate without a body (W3.org validator - XHTML 1.0 strict), and when I added one with no content it causes a blank row. You can use CSS to make this not visible but it still eats up space on the page.This solution works in Chrome 35, Firefox 30 and IE 11 (not tested other versions)Its pure CSS: \nhttp://jsfiddle.net/ffabreti/d4sope1u/Everything is set to display:block, table needs a height:This caused me huge headaches trying to implement such a grid for an application of ours. I tried all the various techniques out there but they each had problems. The closest I came was using a jQuery plugin such as Flexigrid (look on http://www.ajaxrain.com for alternatives), but this doesn't seem to support 100% wide tables which is what I needed.What I ended up doing was rolling my own; Firefox supports scrolling tbody elements so I browser sniffed and used appropriate CSS (setting height, overflow etc... ask if you want more details) to make that scroll, and then for other browsers I used two separate tables set to use table-layout: fixed which uses a sizing algorithm that is guarenteed not to overflow the stated size (normal tables will expand when content is too wide to fit). By giving both tables identical widths I was able to get their columns to line up. I wrapped the second one in a div set to scroll and with a bit of jiggery pokery with margins etc managed to get the look and feel I wanted.Sorry if this answer sounds a bit vague in places; I'm writing quickly as I don't have much time.

However, it doesn't work with large strings of unspaced text. Here's a test case:How do I get the text to be cut off at the edge of the box, rather than having the box expand?Here is the same problem.You need to set table-layout:fixed and a suitable width on the table element, as well as overflow:hidden and white-space: nowrap on the table cells.The width of the table has to be the same (or smaller) than the fixed width cell(s).With one fixed width column:With multiple fixed width columns:A width for the table must be set, but any extra width is simply taken by the fluid cell(s).With multiple columns, fixed width and fluid width:That's just the way TD's are. I believe It may be because the TD element's 'display' property is inherently set to 'table-cell' rather than 'block'.In your case, the alternative may be to wrap the contents of the TD in a DIV and apply width and overflow to the DIV.There may be some padding or cellpadding issues to deal with, and you're better off removing the inline styles and using external css instead, but this should be a start.Apply CSS table-layout:fixed; (and sometimes width:<any px or %>) to the TABLE and white-space: nowrap; overflow: hidden; style on TD. Then set CSS widths on the correct cell or column elements.Significantly, fixed-layout table column widths are determined by the cell widths in the first row of the table. If there are TH elements in the first row, and widths are applied to TD (and not TH), then the width only applies to the contents of the TD (white-space and overflow may be ignored); the table columns will distribute evenly regardless of the set TD width (because there are no widths specified [on TH in the first row]) and the columns will have [calculated] equal widths; the table will not recalculate the column width based on TD width in subsequent rows. Set the width on the first cell elements the table will encounter.Alternatively, and the safest way to set column widths is to use <COLGROUP> and <COL> tags in the table with the CSS width set on each fixed width COL. Cell width related CSS plays nicer when the table knows the column widths in advance.I'm not familiar with the specific issue, but you could stick a div, etc inside the td and set overflow on that.Well here is a solution for you but I don't really understand why it works:Namely, wrapping the cell contents in a div.Best solution is to put a div into table cell with zero width.\nTbody table cells will inherit their widths from widths defined the thead.\nPosition:relative and negative margin should do the trick!Here is a screenshot:\nhttps://flic.kr/p/nvRs4jYou'll have to set the table's style attributes: width and table-layout: fixed; to let  the 'overflow: hidden;' attribute work properly.Imo this works better then using divs with the width style attribute, especially when using it for dynamic resizing calculations, the table will have a simpler DOM which makes manipulation easier because corrections for padding and margin are not required As an extra, you don't have to set the width for all cells but only for the cells in the first row.Like this:I've just had a similar problem, and had to use the <div> inside the <td> at first (John MacIntyre's solution didn't work for me for various reasons).Note though that <td><div>...</div></td> isn't valid placement for a div so instead I'm using a <span> with display:block; set.

To solve this I ended up using 4 divs. \nOne rectangular container that specified the max (fixed) boundaries of the circle.\nInside that would be the div that draws the circle with its width and height set to 100% so changing the size of the parent changes the size of the actual circle.\nInside that would be another rectangular div which, using %'s, would create a text boundary area preventing any text leaving the circle (for the most part)\nThen finally the actual div for the text and vertical centering.It makes more sense as code:You can uncomment the border colours on the container divs to see how it constrains. Things to be aware of:\nYou can still break the bounds of the circle if you put too much text in or use words/unbroken text that are too long. It's still not a good fit for completely unknown text (such as user input) but works best when you know vaguely what the largest amount of text you'll need to store is and set your circle size and font sizes accordingly. You can set the text container div to hide any overflow of course, but that may just look \"broken\" and is no replacement for actually accounting for max size properly in your design.Hope this is useful to someone!

Unfortunately after searching a lot and not finding anything that suits my needs (OK, there's CSS Updater but you have to register and it's a paid extension...) I gave up on Firefox + Firebug and looked for something similar for Google Chrome. Guess what... I just found this great post that shows a nice way of getting this to work ( built into Chrome - there's no need for additional extensions ):Change CSS and SAVE on local file system using Chrome Developer ToolsI tried it now and it works great highlighting the changed lines. Just click Save and you're done! :)Here's a video explaining this and much more: Google I/O 2011: Chrome Dev Tools ReloadedI hope it helps if it doesn't matter to you changing browser while editing your CSS files. I made the change already for now, but I would really love to have this functionality built into Firebug. :)[Update 1]Today I just saw this video: Firefox CSS live edit in Sublimetext (work in progress) Looks promising indeed.[Update 2]If you happen to be using Visual Studio 2013 with Web Essentials you'll be able to sync CSS automagically as shown in this video:Web Essentials: Browser tools integrationBeen wondering the same for quite some time now,\njust gut-wrenching when your in-the-moment-freestyle-css'ing with firebug gets blown to bits by\nan accidental reload or whatnot....For my intents and purposes, I've finally found the tool.... : FireDiff.  It gives you a new tab, probably some weird David Bowie reference, called \"changes\";\nwhich not only allows you to see/save what firebug, i. e. you, have been doing,\nbut also optionally track changes made by the page itself....if it and/or you are so inclined.  So thankful not having to re-type, or re-imagine and then re-re-type, every css rule I make...    Here is a link to the developer (don't be disparaged by first appearance, mayhap just as well head straight over to the Mozilla Add-On repository . The Web Developer add-on let's you save your edits.  I'd like to combine the editing of Firebug with the Save feature of Web Developer. Use the \"Save\" button (click CSS menu -> Edit CSS) to save the modified CSS to disk.Recomendation: Use the \"Stick\" button to prevent losing your changes when you change the tab for doing other browsing. If it is possible, use only one tab to do the edit and other firefox window the related searches, webmail, etc.I just released a firebug addon at the mozilla addon sandbox which might quite do what you want:\nhttps://addons.mozilla.org/en/firefox/addon/52365/It actually saves the \"touched\" css files on demand to your web server (by communication with a one-file webservice php script).Documentation can be found at my homepage or on the addon pageI would appreciate any testing, bug reports, comments, ratings, discussion on this, as it's still in early beta, but should already work fine.I'm surprised that it still not listed to this question, but probably because is new and the author didn't have time to promote it yet.It is called CSS-X-Fire and it is a plugin for JetBrains series of IDEs : IntelliJ IDEA, PHPWebStorm, PyCharm, WebStorm, RubyMine.How it works: \nYou install one of these IDEs and configure the deployment (supports FTP and SCP). This will allow you to stay in sync with the server.After this you install this plugin. When it starts it will ask tell you that he will install a plugin for Firefox, in order to do the integration between Firebug and the IDE. If it fails to install the plugin, just use the drag-n-drop technique to install it.Once installed it will track all your changes from Firebug and you will be able to apply them with a simple click inside de IDE. FireFile is an alternative that requires you to add one small php file to the server side in order to be able to upload the modified css.You could link firebug to eclipse with fireclipse and then save the file from eclipseI think the closest you're going to get is by going into Edit mode in Firebug and copying and pasting the contents of the CSS file.We just introduced Backfire, an open source javascript engine that allows you to save CSS changes made in Firebug and Webkit inspector to the server. The library includes an example C# implementation of how to save the incoming changes to your CSS.Here's a blog post about how it works:\nhttp://blog.quplo.com/2010/08/backfire-save-css-changes-made-in-firebug/And here's the code hosted at Google Code:\nhttp://code.google.com/p/backfire/I know this doesn't answer your question, but surprisingly, Internet Explorer 8's Firebug clone \"developer toolbar\" (accessible via F12) offers the option to \"save html\". This function saves the current DOM to a local file, which means that if you edit the DOM somehow, e.g. by adding a style attribute somewhere, this will be saved too.Not particularly useful if you're using Firebug to mess around with CSS like everyone does, but a step in the right direction.I propose a solution that involves a combination of Firebug and FireFTP as well as code that directly accesses the local file system when running a website locally.Here are the scenarios:Working on a website that is hosted on a remote machineIn this case you would provide the FTP details and the location of the CSS/HTML/Javascript and Firebug would then update these files when you save your changes. It may even be able to locate the files itself and then prompt you to verify that it has the correct file. If file names are unique it shouldn't be a problem.Working on a website running on your local machineIn this case you could provide Firebug with the local folder location of the website and the same behaviour would be used to match and verify the files. The access to the local file system could be performed through FireFTP if necessary.Working on a website hosted remotely without FTP accessIn this case something like the FireFile add-on would have to be implemented.An additional feature would be the ability to save and open project files that store the mappings between the local files and the URLs they are associated with as well as saving the FTP details as FireFTP already does.I am the author of CSS-X-Fire which Sorin Sbarnea also kindly posted about in this thread. Guess I'm a bit late ;)CSS-X-Fire emits CSS property changes from Firebug to the IDE where the changes can be applied or discarded.There are a couple of advantages with this solution over most of the other existing tools which only know know about the filenames and the content downloaded by the browser (see NickFitz comment in the original post).Scenario 1: You have a website (project) which has a handful of themes from which the user can select from. Each theme has its own CSS file but only one is known to Firebug, the current one. CSS-X-Fire will detect all matching selectors in the project and let you decide which should be modified.Scenario 2: The web project has stylesheets created compile-time or during deployment. They might be merged from several files and the file names may change. CSS-X-Fire doesn't care of the names of the files, it only deals with CSS selector names and their properties.Above are examples of scenarios where CSS-X-Fire excels. Since it works with the source files, and knows about the language structure, it also helps to find duplicates not known to Firebug, jump-to-code, etcetera.CSS-X-Fire is open source under the Apache 2 license.\nProject home: http://code.google.com/p/css-x-fire/Firebug was created to detect a problem not to be a debugger. but you can save change if you add new tool that integrate firebug with save changes. it is FireFile, click here \nhttp://thelistoflist.blogspot.com/2010/04/how-to-save-change-you-make-in-firebug.html.FireFile provide the desired functionality by adding a small PHP file to the server side.Since Firebug is not working on your server but taking the CSS from the site and storing it locally and showing you the site with those local changes.Use the CSS editor in the Firefox Web Developer toolbar:http://chrispederick.com/work/web-developer/It's got enough good stuff to use in conjunction with Firebug, and it lets you save your CSS out to a text file.Use Backfire. http://blog.quplo.com/2010/08/backfire-save-css-changes-made-in-firebug/It's an open source solution that sends CSS changes back to the server and saves them. Backfire uses a single javascript file, and the sourcecode package has a working .NET server implementation example that is easily portable to other platforms.I had this problem forever as well, and finally decided that we shouldn't be editing things in the web inspector and built something for it (https://github.com/viatropos/design.io).A better solution:The main reason we're editing css in the web inspector (I use webkit, but FireBug is along the same lines) is because we need to make small adjustments, and it takes too long to reload the page.There are 2 main problems with this approach.  First, you're allowed to edit an individual element that may not have an id selector.  So even if you were able to copy/paste the generated CSS from the web inspector, it would have to generate an id to scope the css.  Something like:That would start making your css a mess.You could get around that by only changing styles for an existing selector (the .space class selector in the webkit inspector image below).Still though, the second problem.  The interface to that thing is pretty rough, it's hard to make big changes - like if you want to try real quick copying this block of css to this place, or whatever.I'd rather just stick to TextMate.The ideal would be to just write the CSS in your text editor and have the browser reflect the changes without reloading the page.  This way you'd be writing your final css as you're making the little changes.The next level would be to write in a dynamic CSS language, like Stylus, Less, SCSS, etc, and have that update the browser with the generated CSS.  This way you could start creating mixins like box-shadow(), that abstracted away the complexities, which the web inspector definitely couldn't do.There's a few things out there that kind of do this, but nothing really streamlining it in my opinion.Not having the ability to easily customize the way these work is the main reason I didn't use them.I put together https://github.com/viatropos/design.io specifically to solve this problem, and make it so:This way, when you need to make those little changes to CSS, you can say, set background color, press save, see nope, not quite, adjust the hue by 10, save, nope, adjust by 5, save, looks good.The way it works is by watching whenever you save a file (at the os level), processing the file (this is where the extensions work), and pushing the data to the browser through websockets, which are then handled (the client side of the extension).Not to plug or anything, but I struggled with this issue for a long ass time.  Hope that helps.Firebug works on the computed CSS (the one which you get by taking the CSS in the files and applying inheritance, etc. plus the changes made with JavaScript). This means that probably you couldn't use it directly to include in an HTML file, which is browser/version specific (unless you care only about Firefox). On the other hand, it keeps track of what is original and what is computed... I think it should not be very difficult to add some JS to Firebug to be able to export that CSS to a text file.I was wondering why can't I bloody well select and copy the text in front of my eyes.  Especially when others say you can just \"select and copy\".  Turns out you can, you just have to start the drag outside of any text (i.e. in the gutter above or to the left of the text) as any mousedown -- whether it's a click or drag -- on any text immediately invokes the property editor.  You can also click outside text to get a cursor (even if it's not always visible) which you can then move around with the arrow keys and select text that way.\n  The text copied to the clipboard is devoid of any indenting, unfortunately, but at least it saves you from manually transcribing the entire contents of the CSS file.  Just have your diff programme ignore changes in whitespace when comparing against the original.You could write your own server script file that takes a filename parameter and a content parameter.The server script would find the requested file and replace its contents with the new one.Writing the Javascript that taps into firebug's info and retrieves the useful data would be the tricky part.I'd personally rather ask the dev team at firebug to supply a function, it shouldn't be too hard for them.Finally, Ajax sends the filename/content pair to the php file you created.Quoted from the Firebug FAQ:Here's a partial solution. After you make your changes, click on one of the links to the relevant file. This is the original file, so you'll have to refresh the file, which is under the options menu button in the upper right of the firebug pane. Now you have the modified css page, which you can copy & paste. Obviously, you'll have to do it for each css file.Edit: looks like Mark Biek has a quicker versionA very easy way to \"edit\" your page is to go onto the site via your internet browser. Save the page as html only onto your desktop. Go to your desktop and right click on the new web page file and select open with, choose notepad and edit the page from there, if you know html it will be easy. After all your editing is done, save the file and reopen your webpage, the changes should be there if done correctly. You can then use your new edited page and export or copy it to your remote locationActually Firebug is a debug and analyze-Tool: not an editor and obviously not considered to be one. The other reason was already mentioned: how to you want to change CSS, stored on a server when debugging a webpage?"},

Why is it possible and is there any real use case where it is desired?", "url": "[When should <script> tags be visible and why can they?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/38143580/when-should-script-tags-be-visible-and-why-can-they)", "vote": 141, "content": "A script element that got styled as display:block appears visible. Why is it possible and is there any real use case where it is desired?The HTML5 specification defines a style sheet that user agents (like browsers) are expected to use. Section 10.3.1 lists the styles for \"Hidden elements\":As you can see, it applies display: none; to script.This is the only \"barrier\" between your users and hidden script elements. It’s perfectly fine and intended to be able to overwrite styles from user-agent style sheets within author style sheets (and of course also within user style sheets).Why someone might want to use it?  One use case is displaying content without having to escape characters like </>, similar to the old xmp element. The script element can be used not only for scripts, but also for data blocks (i.e., for anything with a MIME type).Because they are HTML elements like any other and there is no reason to write special case rules in the HTML specification (which would add complexity) to prevent CSS from applying to them.Any element can be styled. Take, for example:Certainly no common ones, but general rules aren't designed to make sense for everything that you can apply them to. They are designed for the common cases.Another (not common) use case:I sometimes use <script> tags for brief HTML code examples in style guides. That way I don't have to escape HTML tags and special characters. And text editor tag autocomplete and syntax highlighting still work. But there's no easy way to add syntax highlighting in the browser.Possible use case: for debugging purposes.You could apply a class at the document level, eg. <body class=\"debugscript\">, then use some CSS:Script tags are hidden by default by using display:none;. Unor1 explains the underlying language specification. However, they are still part of the DOM and can be styled accordingly.That said, it is important to keep in mind exactly what a script tag is doing. While it used to be accompanied by types and languages, that is no longer required. It is now assumed that JavaScript is in there, and as a result browsers will interpret and execute the script as it is encountered (or loaded) from these tags. Once the script has been executed, the content of the tag is only text (often hidden) on the page. This text can be revealed, but it can also be removed because it is just text. At the bottom of your page, right before the closing </html> tag, you could very easily remove these tags along with their text and there would be no changes to the page.For example:This will not remove any functionality, as the state of the page has already been altered and is reflected in the current global execution context. For example, if the page had loaded a library such as jQuery, removing the tags will not mean that jQuery is no longer exposed because it has already been added to the page's runtime environment. It is essentially only making the DOM inspection tool not show script elements, but it does highlight that the script elements once executed really are only text.1. unor, Thu Jul 07 2016, wutzebaer, \"When should  tags be visible and why can they?\", Jul 1 at 10:53, https://stackoverflow.com/a/38147398/1026459"},

See example comparison of current stable Chrome 35 and latest Chrome 37 (early development preview) here:1.) There is NO proper solution when loading fonts via @import, <link href= or Google's webfont.js. The problem is that Chrome simply requests .woff files from Google's API which render horribly. Surprisingly all other font file types render beautifully. However, there are some CSS tricks that will \"smoothen\" the rendered font a little bit, you'll find the workaround(s) deeper in this answer.2.) There IS a real solution for this when self-hosting the fonts, first posted by Jaime Fernandez in another answer on this Stackoverflow page, which fixes this issue by loading web fonts in a special order. I would feel bad to simply copy his excellent answer, so please have a look there. There is also an (unproven) solution that recommends using only TTF/OTF fonts as they are now supported by nearly all browsers.3.) The Google Chrome developer team works on that issue. As there have been several huge changes in the rendering engine there's obviously something in progress.I've written a large blog post on that issue, feel free to have a look:\nHow to fix the ugly font rendering in Google ChromeSee how the example from the initial question look today, in Chrome 29:Left: Firefox 23, right: Chrome 29Top: Firefox 23, bottom: Chrome 29Fixing the above screenshot with -webkit-text-stroke:First row is default, second has:Third row has:So, the way to fix those fonts is simply giving themor the RGBa syntax (by nezroy, found in the comments!

I'll post news if there're news on this.This is a big bug in Google Chrome and the Google Chrome Team does know about this, see the official bug report here. Currently, in May 2013, even 11 months after the bug was reported, it's not solved. It's a strange thing that the only browser that messes up Google Webfonts is Google's own browser Chrome (!). But there's a simple workaround that will fix the problem, please see below for the solution.STATEMENT FROM GOOGLE CHROME DEVELOPMENT TEAM, MAY 2013Official statement in the bug report comments:Our Windows font rendering is actively being worked on. ... We hope to have something within a milestone or two that developers can start playing with. How fast it goes to stable is, as always, all about how fast we can root out and burn down any regressions.I had the same problem, and I found the solution in this post of Sam Goddard, The solution if to defined the call to the font twice. First as it is recommended, to be used for all the browsers, and after a particular call only for Chrome with a special media query:With this method the font will render good in all browsers. The only negative point that I found is that the font file is also downloaded twice.You can find an spanish version of this article in my pageChrome doesn't render the fonts like Firefox or any other browser does. This is generally a problem in Chrome running on Windows only. If you want to make the fonts smooth, use the -webkit-font-smoothing property on yer h4 tags like this.You can also use subpixel-antialiased, this will give you different type of smoothing (making the text a little blurry/shadowed). However, you will need a nightly version to see the effects. You can learn more about font smoothing here.Ok you can use this simplyMake sure your text color and upper text-stroke-width must me same and that's it.I will say before all that this will not always works, i have tested this with sans-serif font and external fonts like open sansSometimes, when you use huge fonts, try to approximate to font-size:49px and upperThis is a header text with a size of 48px (font-size:48px; in the element that contains the text).But, if you up the 48px to font-size:49px; (and 50px, 60px, 80px, etc...), something interesting happensThe text automatically get smooth, and seems really goodIf you are looking for small fonts, you can try this, but isn't very effective.To the parent of the text, just apply the next css property: -webkit-backface-visibility: hidden;You can transform something like this:To this:(the font is Kreon)Consider that when you are not putting that property, -webkit-backface-visibility: visible; is inheritBut be careful, that practice will not give always good results, if you see carefully, Chrome just make the text look a little bit blurry.-webkit-backface-visibility: hidden; will works too when you transform a text in Chrome (with the -webkit-transform property, that includes rotations, skews, etc)Without -webkit-backface-visibility: hidden;With -webkit-backface-visibility: hidden;Well, I don't know why that practices works, but it does for me.\nSorry for my weird english."},

I also recall finding something for Internet Explorer, but I don't remember what :).Anyway, unless it's a specific situation where text-selecting makes some dynamic functionality fail, you shouldn't really override what users are expecting from a webpage, and that is being able to select any text they want.I'm finding some level of success with the CSS described here http://www.quirksmode.org/css/selection.html:It took care of most of the issues I was having with some ThemeRoller ul elements in an AIR application (WebKit engine). Still getting a small (approx. 15 x 15) patch of nothingness that gets selected, but half the page was being selected before.Absolutely position divs over the text area with a z-index higher and give these divs a transparent GIF background graphic.Note after a bit more thought - You'd need to have these 'covers' be linked so clicking on them would take you to where the tab was supposed to, which means you could/should do this with the anchor element set to display:box, width and height set as well as the transparent background image.For an example of why it might be desirable to suppress selection, see SIMILE TImeline, which uses drag-and-drop to explore  the timeline, during which accidental vertical mouse movement causes the labels to be highlighted unexpectedly, which looks weird.For Safari, -khtml-user-select: none, just like Mozilla's -moz-user-select (or, in JavaScript, target.style.KhtmlUserSelect=\"none\";).That's true, but most copying, in my experience, has nothing to do with \"ultimately\" or geeks or determined plagiarists or anything like that. It's usually casual copying by clueless people, and even a simple, easily defeated protection (easily defeated by folks like us, that is) works quite well to stop them. They don't know anything about \"view source\" or caches or anything else... heck, they don't even know what a web browser is or that they're using one.Here's a Sass mixin (scss) for those interested. Compass/CSS 3 doesn't seem to have a user-select mixin.Though Compass would do it in a more robust way, i.e. only add support for vendors you've chosen.If it looks bad you can use CSS to change the appearance of selected sections.Any JavaScript or CSS method is easily circumvented with Firebug (like Flickr's case).You can use the ::selection pseudo-element in CSS to alter the highlight color.If the tabs are links and the dotted rectangle in active state is of concern, you can remove that too (consider usability of course).There are many occasions when turning off selectability enhances the user experience.For instance allowing the user to copy a block of text on the page without copying the text of any interface elements associated with it (that would become interspersed within the text being copied).Images can be selected too.There are limits to using JavaScript to deselect text, as it might happen even in places where you want to select. To ensure a rich and successful career, steer clear of all requirements that need ability to influence or manage the browser beyond the ordinary... unless, of course, they are paying you extremely well.The following works in Firefox interestingly enough if I remove the write line it doesn't work.\nAnyone have any insight why the write line is needed."},

Works as long as any of HTML5, JS, or CSS are available.<img draggable=\"false\" onmousedown=\"return false\" style=\"user-drag: none\" />If you're confident the user will have JS, you only need to use the JS attribute, etc. For more flexibility, look into ondragstart, onselectstart, and some WebKit tap/touch CSS.Handle the dragstart event and return false.You can assign an alternate ghost image if you really need to use drag events and can't set draggable=false. So just assign a blank png like so: Place the image as a background of an empty div, or under a transparent element. When the user clicks on the image to drag, they are clicking on a div.See http://www.flickr.com/photos/thefella/5878724253/?f=hpFor Firefox you need to go a little deeper with this:Enjoy.I found that for IE, you must add the draggable=\"false\" attribute to images and anchors to prevent dragging. the CSS options work for all other browsers.  I did this in jQuery:There is a much easier solution here than adding empty event listeners. \nJust set pointer-events: noneto your image. If you still need it to be clickable, add a container around it which triggers the event.Tested on Firefox: removing and putting back the image works! And it's transparent at the execution, too. For instance,EDIT: This works only on IE and on Firefox, strangely. I also added draggable = false on each image. Still a ghost with Chrome and Safari.EDIT 2: The background-image solution is genuinely the best one. The only subtlety is that the background-size property has to be redefined every time the background-image is changed! Or so, that's what it looked like from my side. Better still, I had an issue with normal img tags under IE, where IE failed to resize the images. Now, the images have the correct dimensions. Simple:Also, perhaps consider those:You can set the image that is shown when an item is dragged. Tested with Chrome.setDragImageuse  Alternatively, as already mentioned in the answers, you can set draggable=\"false\" on the HTML element, if not being able to drag the element at all is no issue.

It also keeps you from repeating yourself if you reuse the form in other places; your classes or other attributes just work if you use the Django's as_table/as_ul/as_p form methods.  If you need full control for a completely custom rendering, this is clearly documented-- EDIT 2 ---\nAdded a newer way to specify widget and attrs for a ModelForm.This can be done using a custom template filter. Consider rendering your form this way:form.subject is an instance of BoundField which has the as_widget() method.You can create a custom filter addclass in my_app/templatetags/myfilters.py:And then apply your filter:form.subjects will then be rendered with the MyClass CSS class.If you don't want to add any code to the form (as mentioned in the comments to @shadfc's Answer), it is certainly possible, here are two options.First, you just reference the fields individually in the HTML, rather than the entire form at once:(Note that I also changed it to a unsorted list.) Second, note in the docs on outputting forms as HTML, Django:All of your form fields already have a unique id. So you would reference id_subject in your CSS file to style the subject field. I should note, this is how the form behaves when you take the default HTML, which requires just printing the form, not the individual fields:See the previous link for other options when outputting forms (you can do tables, etc).Note - I realize this isn't the same as adding a class to each element (if you added a field to the Form, you'd need to update the CSS also) - but it's easy enough to reference all of the fields by id in your CSS like this:Per this blog post, you can add css classes to your fields using a custom template filter.You can do like this:Hope that works.IgnasYou could use this library: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/django-widget-tweaksIt allows you to do the following:You can do:Then you can add classes/id's to for example the <td> tag. You can of course use any others tags you want. Check Working with Django forms as an example what is available for each field in the form ({{field}} for example is just outputting the input tag, not the label and so on).One solution is to use JavaScript to add the required CSS classes after the page is ready. For example, styling django form output with bootstrap classes (jQuery used for brevity):This avoids the ugliness of mixing styling specifics with your business logic.You may not need to override your form class' __init__, because Django sets name & id attributes in the HTML inputs. You can have CSS like this:Didn't see this one really...https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.8/ref/forms/api/#more-granular-outputThe as_p(), as_ul() and as_table() methods are simply shortcuts for lazy developers – they’re not the only way a form object can be displayed.class BoundField\nUsed to display HTML or access attributes for a single field of a Form instance.The str() (unicode on Python 2) method of this object displays the HTML for this field.To retrieve a single BoundField, use dictionary lookup syntax on your form using the field’s name as the key:To retrieve all BoundField objects, iterate the form:The field-specific output honors the form object’s auto_id setting:There is a very easy to install and great tool made for Django that I use for styling and it can be used for every frontend framework like Bootstrap, Materialize, Foundation, etc. It is called widget-tweaks Documentation: Widget Tweaksfrom django import formsInstead of using default:You can edit it your own way using the render_field attribute that gives you a more html-like way of styling it like this example:template.htmlThis library gives you the opportunity to have well separated yout front end from your backendWrite your form like:In your HTML field do something like:Then in your CSS write something like:Hope this answer is worth a try! Note you must have written your views to render the HTML file that contains the form.In Django 1.10 (possibly earlier as well) you can do it as follows.Model:Form:Template:Edit: Another (slightly better) way of doing what I'm suggesting is answered here: Django form input field stylingAll the above options are awesome, just thought I'd throw in this one because it's different.If you want custom styling, classes, etc. on your forms, you can make an html input in your template that matches your form field. For a CharField, for example, (default widget is TextInput), let's say you want a bootstrap-looking text input. You would do something like this: <input type=\"text\" class=\"form-control\" name=\"form_field_name_here\"> And as long as you put the form field name matches the html name attribue, (and the widget probably needs to match the input type as well) Django will run all the same validators on that field when you run validate or form.is_valid() and Styling other things like labels, error messages, and help text don't require much workaround because you can do something like form.field.error.as_text and style them however you want. The actual fields are the ones that require some fiddling.I don't know if this is the best way, or the way I would recommend, but it is a way, and it might be right for someone.Here's a useful walkthrough of styling forms and it includes most of the answers listed on SO (like using the attr on the widgets and widget tweaks).\nhttps://simpleisbetterthancomplex.com/article/2017/08/19/how-to-render-django-form-manually.htmlStyling widget instancesIf you want to make one widget instance look different from another, you will need to specify additional attributes at the time when the widget object is instantiated and assigned to a form field (and perhaps add some rules to your CSS files).https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.2/ref/forms/widgets/To do this, you use the Widget.attrs argument when creating the widget:You can also modify a widget in the form definition:Or if the field isn’t declared directly on the form (such as model form fields), you can use the Form.fields attribute:Django will then include the extra attributes in the rendered output:"},

Then use .height() function to check if height of the inner div is greater than the height of the outer div. I'm not sure it will work but give it a try.use js to check if the child's offsetHeight is more than the parents.. if it is,make the parents overflow scroll/hidden/auto whichever you want and also display:block on the more div..

I've also included extra_width because my elements (\"tags\") contain images which take small time to load, but during the function call they have zero width, spoiling the calculation. To get around that, I use the following calling code:Hope this helps.You can check the bounds relative to the offset parent.If you pass this an element it will tell you whether its bounds are entirely inside a container, and will default to the element's offset parent if no explicit container is provided.

Other than that it's equal to the first one.So if the HTML looks like this, the CSS values will be applied to the inner <div> tag as well.If you want to set CSS tags that apply for multiple classes separately then you need to split them up using a comma. So it looks like this: Edit: By request the link to the documentation of the CSS selectors.means .symbol inside .elementmeans .element that has the class symbol as well.So,means .symbol inside .element that has the class large as well.Usingrefers to an element with both classes:rather than a descendant of an element:meaning that in:onlyis 'receiving' the styles.Basically, being separated by a space implies two elements with a descendant relationship.You would use .element .symbol this where you have an element inside of another element. For example:If down the road you wanted to differentiate some divs, you could add an additional class to target only those that differ, and target it with .element.large .symbol. So, for example:In your second example, the first part of the selector is simply an element with two classes, as in <span class=\"element large\"> or <span class=\"large element\">.In general, each part of a selector applies to one HTML element.table[border].clname means a table with a border attribute and a class of clname, while table [border] .clname means an element with class clname, in an element with a border attribute, in a table.(Edit: well, I say \"one HTML element\", but of course you can have more than one table that this applies to.

A simple and common example would be implement the facebook style sliding drawer menu: This effect can be achieved through transitions like so:http://jsfiddle.net/NwEGz/Or, through animations like so:http://jsfiddle.net/4Z5Mr/With HTML that looks like so:And, this accompanying jQuery script:What I'd like to understand is what are the pros and cons of these approaches. It looks like you've got a handle on how to do them, just not when to do them.A transition is an animation, just one that is performed between two distinct states - i.e. a start state and an end state. Like a drawer menu, the start state could be open and the end state could be closed, or vice versa.If you want to perform something that does not specifically involve a start state and an end state, or you need more fine grain control over the keyframes in a transition, then you've got to use an animation.I'll let the definitions speak for themselves (according to Merriam-Webster):The names appropriately fit their purposes in CSSSo, the example you gave should use transitions because it is only a change from one state to anotherA shorter answer, straight on point:Transition:Animation @keyframes:Both use CPU acceleration for a much smoother effect.Animations are just that - a smooth behavior of set of properties. In other words it specifies what should happen to a set of element's properties. You define an animation and describe how this set of properties should behave during the animation process.Transitions on the other side specify how a property (or properties) should perform their change. Each change. Setting a new value for certain property, be it with JavaScript or CSS, is always a transition, but by default it is not smooth. By setting transition in the css style you define different (smooth) way to perform these changes.It can be said that transitions define a default animation that should be performed every time the specified property has changed.In modern browsers, h/w acceleration occurs for the properties filter, opacity and transform. This is for both CSS Animations and CSS Transitions.I believe CSS3 animation vs CSS3 transition will give you the answer you want.Basically below are some takeaways :"},

I think the best bet is to use jQuery UI's position() setter as noted by xdazz. However if jQuery UI is, for some reason, not an option (yet jQuery is), I prefer this:This has the advantage of not arbitrarily setting $div's parent to relative positioning (what if $div's parent was, itself, absolute positioned inside something else?). I think the only major edge case is if $div doesn't have any offsetParent, not sure if it would return document, null, or something else entirely.offsetParent has been available since jQuery 1.2.6, sometime in 2008, so this technique works now and when the original question was asked.Use offset() function of jQuery.

My argument however is that a className can be regarded as a definition of \"why you want the background to be this or that color.\" For instance, making it red is not just because you want it red, but because you'd want to inform users of an error. As such, setting the className AnErrorHasOccured on the body would be my preferred implementation.In cssIn JavaScript:This leaves you the options of styling more elements according to this className.

Several of these methods can be found here:The Mobify link above was removed and now references an archive.org copy, but appears to be implemented in this codepen.Just increase the -webkit-line-clamp: 4;  to increase the number of linesLine clamp is a proprietary and undocumented CSS (webkit) : https://caniuse.com/#feat=css-line-clamp, so it currently work on only few browsers.Please check this css for ellipsis to multi-line text I finally found a solution to do what I want. \nAs p a paragraphe and article the wrapper. \nIf you want to apply ellipsis to p depending on article height (which also depends on window height), you need to get the height of the article, the line-height of the p and then articleHeight/lineHeight to find the number of line-clamp that can be added dynamically then.

Basically, if you are ok with potentially having a pixel or so cut off from your last character, here is a pure css and html solution:The way this works is by absolutely positioning a div below the viewable region of a viewport. We want the div to offset up into the visible region as our content grows. If the content grows too much, our div will offset too high, so upper bound the height our content can grow.HTML:CSS:I have tested this in Chrome, FF, Safari, and IE 11. You can check it out here: http://codepen.io/puopg/pen/vKWJwKYou might even be able to alleviate the abrupt cut off of the character with some CSS magic. EDIT: I guess one thing that this imposes is word-break: break-all since otherwise the content would not extend to the very end of the viewport. :(Unfortunately no with current state of affairs in CSS.

On mobile you don't see the scrollbar, you just scroll until you see the content (of the iframe).

There's not currently a work-around that I'm aware of.It is also documented on Eric Meyer's article: Un-fixing Fixed Elements with CSS Transforms.I had a flickering on my fixed top nav when items in the page were using transform, the following applied to my top nav resolved the jumping/flickering issue:Thanks to this answer on SOAs Bradoergo suggested, just get the window scrollTop and add it to the absolute position top like:This worked for me anyway.In Firefox and Safari you can use position: sticky; instead of position: fixed; but it will not work in other browsers. For that you need javascript.In my opinion, the best method to deal with this is to apply the same translate, but break children that need to be fixed out of their parent (translated) element; and then apply the translate to a div inside the position: fixed wrapper.The results look something like this (in your case):JSFiddle: https://jsfiddle.net/hju4nws1/ While this may not be ideal for some use cases, typically if you're fixing a div you probably could care less about what element is its parent/where it falls in the inheritance tree in your DOM, and seems to solve most of the headache - while still allowing both translate and position: fixed to live in (relative) harmony.I ran across the same problem. The only difference is that my element with 'position: fixed' had its 'top' and 'left' style properties set from JS. So I was able to apply a fix:oRect object will contain real (relative to view port) top and left coordinates. So you can adjust your actual oElement.style.top and oElement.style.left properties.I have an off canvas sidebar that uses -webkit-transform: translate3d.  This was preventing me from placing a fixed footer on the page.  I resolved the issue by targeting a class on the html page that is added to the  tag on initialization of the sidebar and then writing a css :not qualifier to state \"-webkit-transform: none;\" to the html tag when that class is not present on the html tag.  Hope this helps someone out there with this same issue!Try to apply opposite transform to the child element:Add a dynamic class while the element transforms.$('#elementId').addClass('transformed').\nThen go on to declare in css, then thenNow position: fixed when provided with a top and z-index property values on a child element just work fine and stay fixed until the parent element transforms. When the transformation is reverted the child element pops as fixed again. This should easen the situation if you are actually using a navigation sidebar that toggles open and closes upon a click, and you have a tab-set which should stay sticky as you scroll down the page.One way to deal with this is to apply the same transform to the fixed element:"},

Set its position to absolute, its height to the height of the select, and you should be good to go!Solution with custom right drop-down arrow, uses only css (no images)One way to keep it simple and avoid messing with the arrows and other such features is just to house it in a div with the same background color as the select tag.

First of all, you probably want to add the name attribute on the radio buttons. Otherwise, they are not part of the same group, and multiple radio buttons can be checked.  Also, since I placed the labels as siblings (of the radio buttons), I had to use the id and for attributes to associate them together.If you really want to put the checkboxes inside the label, try adding an extra span tag, eg.HTMLCSSThat will set the backgrounds for all siblings of the selected radio button.You are using an adjacent sibling selector (+) when the elements are not siblings.

All my images have variable heights and the container can't have a fixed height/line height because it's responsive... Please help!Here is a technique to align inline elements inside a parent, horizontally and vertically at the same time:1) In this approach, we create an inline-block (pseudo-)element as the first (or last) child of the parent, and set its height property to 100% to take all the height of its parent.2) Also, adding vertical-align: middle keeps the inline(-block) elements at the middle of the line space. So, we add that CSS declaration to the first-child and our element (the image) both.3) Finally, in order to remove the white space character between inline(-block) elements, we could set the font size of the parent to zero by font-size: 0;.Note: I used Nicolas Gallagher's image replacement technique in the following.This section is not going to answer the question as the OP already knows how to create a responsive container. However, I'll explain how it works.In order to make the height of a container element changes with its width (respecting the aspect ratio), we could use a percentage value for top/bottom padding property.A percentage value on top/bottom padding or margins is relative to the width of the containing block.For instance:Here is the Online Demo. Comment out the lines from the bottom and resize the panel to see the effect.Also, we could apply the padding property to a dummy child or :before/:after pseudo-element to achieve the same result. But note that in this case, the percentage value on padding is relative to the width of the .responsive-container itself.Demo #1.\nDemo #2 (Using :after pseudo-element)Using padding-top property causes a huge space at the top or bottom of the content, inside the container.In order to fix that, we have wrap the content by a wrapper element, remove that element from document normal flow by using absolute positioning, and finally expand the wrapper (bu using top, right, bottom and left properties) to fill the entire space of its parent, the container.Here we go:Here is the Online Demo.Here is the WORKING DEMO.Obviously, you could avoid using ::before pseudo-element for browser compatibility, and create an element as the first child of the .img-container:UPDATED DEMO.In order to keep the image inside of the box in lower width, you could set max-height and max-width property on the image:Here is the UPDATED DEMO.With flexbox this is easy:FIDDLEJust add the following to the image container:Use this css, as you already have the markup for it:Here is a working JsBin: http://jsbin.com/ihilUnI/1/editThis solution only works for square images (because a percentage margin-top value depends on the width of the container, not the height).

An inline style attribute, on the other hand, is specified within HTML for a particular element.Since inline styles can only occur in HTML, they will only apply to the HTML element that they're defined on, and not to any pseudo-elements it generates.As an aside, the main difference between pseudo-elements and pseudo-classes in this aspect is that properties that are inherited by default will be inherited by :before and :after from the generating element, whereas pseudo-class styles just don't apply at all. In your case, for example, if you place text-align: justify in an inline style attribute for a td element, it will be inherited by td:after. The caveat is that you can't declare td:after with the inline style attribute; you must do it in the stylesheet.as mentioned above: its not possible to call a css pseudo-class / -element inline.\nwhat i now did, is:\ngive your element a unique identifier, f.ex. an id or a unique class.\nand write a fitting <style> elementfugly, but what inline css isnt..?You can use the data in inlineNo you cant target the pseudo-classes or pseudo-elements in inline-css as  David Thomas said.\nFor more details see this answer by BoltClock about Pseudo-classesWe can also write use same for the pseudo-elements Yes it's possible, just add inline styles for the element which you adding after or before, ExampleYou can't create pseudo elements in inline css.However, if you can create a pseudo element in a stylesheet, then there's a way to style it inline by setting an inline style to its parent element, and then using inherit keyword to style the pseudo element, like this:sometimes this can be handy.As mentioned before, you can't use inline elements for styling pseudo classes. Before and after pseudo classes are states of elements, not actual elements. You could only possibly use \nJavaScript for this.  If you have control over the HTML then you could add a real element instead of a pseudo one.\n:before and :after pseudo elements are rendered right after the open tag or right before the close tag.\nThe inline equivalent for this cssWould be something like this:Keep in mind; Your \"real\" before and after elements and anything with inline css will greatly increase the size of your pages and ignore page load optimizations that external css and pseudo elements make possible."},

I know iScroll and it does not always seem to work (even in their demo). I also know that Sencha has a fix for that, but I couldn't Ctrl + F the source code for that fix.I am hoping that someone may have the solution. The problem is that fixed positioned elements do not get updated when the user pans down/up on an iOS powered mobile Safari.A lot of mobile browsers deliberately do not support position:fixed; on the grounds that fixed elements could get in the way on a small screen.The Quirksmode.org site has a very good blog post that explains the problem: http://www.quirksmode.org/blog/archives/2010/12/the_fifth_posit.htmlAlso see this page for a compatibility chart showing which mobile browsers support position:fixed;: http://www.quirksmode.org/m/css.html(but note that the mobile browser world is moving very quickly, so tables like this may not stay up-to-date for long!)Update:\niOS 5 and Android 4 are both reported to have position:fixed support now. I tested iOS 5 myself in an Apple store today and can confirm that it does work with position fixed. There are issues with zooming in and panning around a fixed element though.I found this compatibility table far more up to date and useful than the quirksmode one:\nhttp://caniuse.com/#search=fixedIt has up to date info on Android, Opera (mini and mobile) & iOS.Fixed positioning doesn't work on iOS like it does on computers.Imagine you have a sheet of paper (the webpage) under a magnifying glass(the viewport), if you move the magnifying glass and your eye, you see a different part of the page. This is how iOS works.Now there is a sheet of clear plastic with a word on it, this sheet of plastic stays stationary no matter what (the position:fixed elements). So when you move the magnifying glass the fixed element appears to move.Alternatively, instead of moving the magnifying glass, you move the paper (the webpage), keeping the sheet of plastic and magnifying glass still. In this case the word on the sheet of plastic will appear to stay fixed, and the rest of the content will appear to move (because it actually is) This is a traditional desktop browser.So in iOS the viewport moves, in a traditional browser the webpage moves. In both cases the fixed elements stay still in reality; although on iOS the fixed elements appear to move.The way to get around this, is to follow the last few paragraphs in this article(basically disable scrolling altogether, have the content in a separate scrollable div (see the blue box at the top of the linked article), and the fixed element positioned absolutely)\"position:fixed\" now works as you'd expect in iOS5.position: fixed does work on android/iphone for vertical scrolling.  But you need to make sure your meta tags are fully set. e.gAlso if you're planning on having the same page work on android pre 4.0, you need to set the top position also, or a small margin will be added for some reason.now apple support thatFixed Footer (here with jQuery):Hope it helps.I had this problem on Safari (iOS 10.3.3) - the browser was not redrawing until the touchend event fired. Fixed elements did not appear or were cut off.The trick for me was adding transform: translate3d(0,0,0); to my fixed position element.EDIT - I now know why the transform fixes the issue: hardware-acceleration. Adding the 3D transformation triggers the GPU acceleration making for a smooth transition. For more on hardware-acceleration checkout this article: http://blog.teamtreehouse.com/increase-your-sites-performance-with-hardware-accelerated-css. Avoid on the same box using transform:--- and position:fixed. Element will stay in position:static if there is any transform.I ended up using the new jQuery Mobile v1.1: http://jquerymobile.com/blog/2012/04/13/announcing-jquery-mobile-1-1-0/using jquery i am able to come up with this. it doesnt scroll smooth, but it does the trick. you can scroll down, and the fixed div pops up on top.THE CSSTHE HTMLTHE jQUERYFinally we want to determine if the ipod touch in landscape or portrait mode to display accordinglyEven though the CSS attribute {position:fixed;} seems (mostly) working on newer iOS devices, it is possible to have the device quirk and fallback to {position:relative;} on occasion and without cause or reason. Usually clearing the cache will help, until something happens and the quirk happens again.Specifically, from Apple itself Preparing Your Web Content for iPad:What is ironic, Android devices do not seem to have this issue. Also it is entirely possible to use {position:absolute;} when in reference to the body tag and not have any issues.I found the root cause of this quirk; that it is the scroll event not playing nice when used in conjunction with the HTML or BODY tag. Sometimes it does not like to fire the event, or you will have to wait until the scroll swing event is finished to receive the event. Specifically, the viewport is re-drawn at the end of this event and fixed elements can be re-positioned somewhere else in the viewport.So this is what I do: (avoid using the viewport, and stick with the DOM!)In essence this will cause the BODY to be the size of the viewport and non-scrollable. The scrollable DIV nested inside will scroll as the BODY normally would (minus the swing effect, so the scrolling does stop on touchend.) The fixed DIV stays fixed without interference.As a side note, a high z-index value on the fixed DIV is important to keep the scrollable DIV appear to be behind it. I normally add in window resize and scroll events also for cross-browser and alternate screen resolution compatibility.If all else fails, the above code will also work with both the fixed and scrollable DIVs set to {position:absolute;}. The simple way to fix this problem just types transform property for your element. and it will be fixed. Happy Coding :-)Also you can try his way as well this is also work fine.here is my solution to this...CSS HTMLExplanation is that position fixed for the div will keep the div on the background at all time, then we stretch the div to go on all corners of the browser (provided the body margin = 0) using the (left,right,top,bottom) simultaneously.Please make sure you do not use the width and height as this will override the top,left,right,bottom options."},

I have yet to witness this although I'm testing it locally.Is there a way to load the CSS through the object passed to Angular's $routeProvider.when?Thanks in advance!I know this question is old now, but after doing a ton of research on various solutions to this problem, I think I may have come up with a better solution.  In case anyone in the future is interested, here's what I came up with:1.  Create a custom directive for the <head> element:This directive does the following things:Note: this requires that your ng-app attribute is on the <html> element, not on <body> or anything inside of <html>.2. Specify which stylesheets belong to which routes using the $routeProvider:This config adds a custom css property to the object that is used to setup each page's route.  That object gets passed to each '$routeChangeStart' event as .$$route.  So when listening to the '$routeChangeStart' event, we can grab the css property that we specified and append/remove those <link /> tags as needed.  Note that specifying a css property on the route is completely optional, as it was omitted from the '/some/route/2' example. If the route doesn't have a css property, the <head> directive will simply do nothing for that route.  Note also that you can even have multiple page-specific stylesheets per route, as in the '/some/route/3' example above, where the css property is an array of relative paths to the stylesheets needed for that route.3. You're done\nThose two things setup everything that was needed and it does it, in my opinion, with the cleanest code possible.Hope that helps someone else who might be struggling with this issue as much as I was.@tennisgent's solution is great. However, I think is a little limited.Modularity and Encapsulation in Angular goes beyond routes. Based on the way the web is moving towards component-based development, it is important to apply this in directives as well.As you already know, in Angular we can include templates (structure) and controllers (behavior) in pages and components. AngularCSS enables the last missing piece: attaching stylesheets (presentation).For a full solution I suggest using AngularCSS. https://github.com/door3/angular-cssHere are some examples:RoutesDirectivesAdditionally, you can use the $css service for edge cases:You can read more about AngularCSS here:http://door3.com/insights/introducing-angularcss-css-demand-angularjsCould append a new stylesheet to head within $routeProvider. For simplicity am using a string but could create new link element also, or create a service for stylesheetsBiggest benefit of prelaoding in page is any background images will already exist, and less lieklyhood of FOUC@sz3, funny enough today I had to do exactly what you were trying to achieve: 'load a specific CSS file only when a user access' a specific page. So I used the solution above.But I am here to answer your last question: 'where exactly should I put the code. Any ideas?'You were right including the code into the resolve, but you need to change a bit the format.Take a look at the code below:I've just tested and it's working fine, it injects the html and it loads my 'home.css' only when I hit the '/home' route.Full explanation can be found here, but basically resolve: should get an object in the format You can name the 'key' anything you like - in my case I called 'style'.Then for the value you have two options:The main point here is that the code inside the function is going to be executed before before the controller is instantiated and the $routeChangeSuccess event is fired.Hope that helps.Awesome, thank you!! Just had to make a few adjustments to get it working with ui-router:If you only need your CSS to be applied to one specific view, I'm using this handy snippet inside my controller:This will add a class to my body tag when the state loads, and remove it when the state is destroyed (i.e. someone changes pages). This solves my related problem of only needing CSS to be applied to one state in my application.'use strict';\nangular.module('app')\n    .run(\n        [\n            '$rootScope', '$state', '$stateParams',\n            function($rootScope, $state, $stateParams) {\n                $rootScope.$state = $state;\n                $rootScope.$stateParams = $stateParams;\n            }\n        ]\n    )\n    .config(\n        [\n            '$stateProvider', '$urlRouterProvider',\n            function($stateProvider, $urlRouterProvider) {"},

This is supported in almost all modern browsers, including IE9+. Here's an example.HTMLCSSTIP: You may need to add margin to your stretched text to prevent text collisions.I'll answer for horizontal stretching of text, since the vertical is the easy part - just use \"transform: scaleY()\"letter-spacing just adds space between letters, stretches nothing, but it's kinda relativeinline-block because inline elements are too restrictive and the code below wouldn't work otherwisefont-size to get to the size we want - that way the text will really be of the length it's supposed to be and the text before and after it will appear next to it (scaleX is just for show, the browser still sees the element at its original size when positioning other elements).scaleY to reduce the height of the text, so that it's the same as the text beside it.transform-origin to make the text scale from the top of the line.margin-bottom set to a negative value, so that the next line will not be far below - preferably percentage, so that we won't change the line-height property.\nvertical-align set to top, to prevent the text before or after from floating to other heights (since the stretched text has a real size of 32px)-- The simple span element has a font-size, only as a reference.The question asked for a way to prevent the boldness of the text caused by the stretch and I still haven't given one, BUT the font-weight property has more values than just normal and bold.I know, you just can't see that, but if you search for the appropriate fonts, you can use the more values.Technically, no. But what you can do is use a font size that is as tall as you would like the stretched font to be, and then condense it horizontally with font-stretch.The only way I can think of for short texts like \"MENU\" is to put every single letter in a span and justify them in a container afterwards. Like this:And then the CSS:Always coming back to this page when a designer stretches a font on me. The accepted solution works great, but I frequently run into issues with margins.Would recommend using the transform on the height instead of the width if you're running into issues, was a life safer for me in  my current project.CSS font-stretch is now supported in all major browsers (except iOS Safari and Opera Mini). It is not easy to find a common font-family that supports expanding fonts, but it is easy to find fonts that support condensing, for example:"},

Why is an explicit height required?When you specify a percentage for max-height on a child, it is a percentage of the parent's actual height, not the parent's max-height, oddly enough. The same applies to max-width.So, when you don't specify an explicit height on the parent, then there's no base height for the child's max-height to be calculated from, so max-height computes to none, allowing the child to be as tall as possible. The only other constraint acting on the child now is the max-width of its parent, and since the image itself is taller than it is wide, it overflows the container's height downwards, in order to maintain its aspect ratio while still being as large as possible overall.When you do specify an explicit height for the parent, then the child knows it has to be at most 100% of that explicit height. That allows it to be constrained to the parent's height (while still maintaining its aspect ratio).I played around a little. On a larger image in firefox, I got a good result with using the inherit property value. Will this help you?I found a solution here:\nhttp://www.sitepoint.com/maintain-image-aspect-ratios-responsive-web-design/The trick is possible because it exists a relation between WIDTH and PADDING-BOTTOM of an element. So:parent:child (remove all css related to width, i.e. width:100%):You can use the property object-fitLike suggested hereA full explanation of this property by Chris Mills in Dev.OperaAnd an even better one in CSS-TricksIt's supported inI just checked that vivaldi and chromium support it as well (no surprise here)It's currently not supported on IE, but... who cares ? Also, iOS supports object-fit, but not object-position, but it will soon.Maybe someone else can explain the reasons behind your problem but you can solve it by specifying the height of the container and then setting the height of the image to be 100%. It is important that the width of the image appears before the height.The closest I can get to this is this example:http://jsfiddle.net/YRFJQ/1/orThe main problem is that the height takes the percentage of the containers height, so it is looking for an explicitly set height in the parent container, not it's max-height.The only way round this to some extent I can see is the fiddle above where you can hide the overflow, but then the padding still acts as visible space for the image to flow into, and so replacing with a solid border works instead (and then adding border-box to make it 200px if that's the width you need)Not sure if this would fit with what you need it for, but the best I can seem to get to.Here is a solution for a recently opened question marked as a duplicate of this question.  The <img> tag was exceeding the max-height of the parent <div>.Broken: FiddleWorking: FiddleIn this case, adding display:flex to the 2 parent <div> tags was the answerInstead of going with max-height: 100%/100%, an alternative approach of filling up all the space would be using position: absolute with top/bottom/left/right set to 0.In other words, the HTML would look like the following:You can see a live example at Codesandbox - Overflow within CSS Flex/GridA good solution is to not use height on the parent and use it just on the child with View Port :Fiddle Example: https://jsfiddle.net/voan3v13/1/Containers will already generally wrap their content nicely. It often doesn't work as well the other way around: children don't fill their ancestors nicely. So, set your width/height values on the inner-most element rather than the outer-most element, and let the outer elements wrap their contents.Your container does not have a height.Add\n    height: 200px;to the containers css and the kitty will stay inside."},

You can change between landscape and portrait without any issues.\nHowever by simply changing the Content.html CSS by adding this:You get this:\nAs you can see, even though the Content.html content is fully responsive (div#ScrolledArea has overflow: scroll set) and the iframe width is 100% the iframe still takes the full width of the div#ScrolledArea as if the overflow does not even exist. DemoIn cases like this, were the iframecontent has scrolling areas on it, the question becomes, how to get the iframe responsive, when the iframe content has horizontally scrolling areas? The problem here is not in the fact that the Content.html is not responsive, but in the fact that the iOS Safari simply resizes the iframe so that the div#ScrolledArea would be fully visible.The solution for this problem is actually quite simple and there are two ways to go about it. If you have control over the Content.html then simply change the div#ScrolledArea width CSS to:Basically the idea here is simple, you set the width to something that is smaller than the viewport (iframe width in this case) and then overwrite it with min-width: 100% to allow for actual width: 100% which iOS Safari by default overwrites. The *width: 100%; is there so the code would remain IE6 compatible, but if you do not care for IE6 you can omit it. Demo\nAs you can see now, the div#ScrolledArea width is actually 100% and the overflow: scroll; can do it's thing and hide the overflowing content. If you have access to the iframe content, then this is preferable. However if you do not have access to the iframe content (for what ever reason) then you can actually use the same technique on the iframe itself. Simply use the same CSS on the iframe:However, there is one limitation with this, you need to turn off the scrollbars with scrolling=\"no\" on the iframe for this to work:If the scrollbars are allowed, then this wont work on the iframe anymore. That said, if you modify the Content.html instead then you can retain the scrolling in the iframe. DemoThe problem, it seems, is that Mobile Safari will refuse to obey the width of your iFrame if the document it contains is wider than what you have specified. Example:http://jsbin.com/hapituto/1On a desktop browser, you will see an iFrame and a Div both set to 300px. The contents is wider so you can scroll the iFrame.On mobile safari, however, you will notice that the iFrame is auto-expanded to the width of the content. My guess is that this is a workaround for long-standing issues with scrolling content within a page. In the past, if you had a large scrolling iframe on a touch device, you'd get 'stuck' in the iframe as that would be scrolling instead of the page itself. It appears Apple has decided that the default behavior of an iFrame is 'no scroll' and expands to prevent it. One option may be this workaround. Instead of assuming the iFrame will scroll, place the iframe in a DIV that you do have control over and let that scroll. example: http://jsbin.com/zakedaja/1Example markup:On mobile safari, you can now scroll the contents of the now fully-expanded iFrame via the div that is containing it.The catch: This looks really ugly on a desktop browser, as now you have double scrollbars. So you may have to do some browser detection with JS to get around this. I needed a cross-browser solution. Requirements were:Building off what I learned from @Idra regarding scrolling=\"no\" on iOS and this post about fitting iFrame content to the screen in iOS here's what I ended up with.  Hope it helps someone =)HTMLCSSJSThe problem with all these solutions is that the height of the iframe never really changes.This means you won't be able to center elements inside the iframe using Javascript, position:fixed;, or position:absolute; since the iframe itself never scrolls.My solution detailed here is to wrap all the content of the iframe inside a div using this CSS:This way Safari believes the content has no height and lets you assign the height of the iframe properly. This also allows you to position elements in any way you wish.You can see a quick and dirty demo here.This issue is also present on iOS Chrome.I glanced through all the solutions above, most are very hacky.If you don't need support for older browsers, just set the iframe width to 100vw;Note : Check support for viewport units\nhttps://caniuse.com/#feat=viewport-unitsI am working with ionic2 and system config is as below-  For me this issue got resolved with this code-\nfor html iframe tag-See css of the same as-   Position property play a vital role here in my case.\nposition:relative;It may help you too!!!CSS only solutionHTMLCSSDEMOAnother demo here with HTML page in iframeI had an issue with width on the content pane creating a horizontal scroll bar for the iframe.

So the first part of getting your code to work correctly is by removing that spaceThen, in order to get the style to not work, you have to override the style set by the :hover. In other words, you need to counter the background-color property. So the final code will be FiddleAn alternative method would be to use :not(), as stated by others. This will return any element that doesn't have the class or property stated inside the parenthesis. In this case, you would put .remode_selected in there. This will target all elements that don't have a class of .remode_selectedFiddleHowever, I would not recommend this method, because of the fact that it was introduced in CSS3, so browser support is not ideal.A third method would be to use jQuery.

You'll need to choose between the following scenarios:which is semantically incorrect, but it will work.which is semantically correct but it involves using JS.which is semantically correct and works as expected but is not a div any more.Why don't you strip out the <div> element and replace it with an <a> instead?  Just because the anchor tag isn't a div doesn't mean you can't style it with display:block, a height, width, background, border, etc.  You can make it look like a div but still act like a link.  Then you're not relying on invalid code or JavaScript that may not be enabled for some users.Do it like this: Parentdivimage should have specified width and height, and its position should be:Just inside the parentdivimage, next to other divs that parent contains you should put:Then in css file:The span tag will fill out its parent block which is parentdiv, because of height and width set to 100%. Span will be on the top of all of surrounding elements because of setting z-index higher than other elements. Finally span will be clickable, because it's inside of an 'a' tag.Two things you can do:Going off of what Surreal Dreams said, it's probably best to style the anchor tag in my experience, but it really does depend on what you are doing.  Here's an example:Html:Then the CSS:http://jsbin.com/zijijuduqo/1/edit?html,css,outputMake the div of id=\"childdivimag\" a span instead, and wrap that in an a element. As the span and img are in-line elements by default this remains valid, whereas a div is a block level element, and therefore invalid mark-up when contained within an a.put display:block on the anchor element. and/or zoom:1; but you should just really do this. What I would do is put a span inside the <a> tag, set the span to block, and add size to the span, or just apply the styling to the <a> tag. Definitely handle the positioning in the <a> tag style. Add an onclick event to the a where JavaScript will catch the event, then return false at the end of the JavaScript event to prevent default action of the href and bubbling of the click. This works in cases with or without JavaScript enabled, and any AJAX can be handled in the Javascript listener. If you're using jQuery, you can use this as your listener and omit the onclick in the a tag. this allows you to attach listeners to any changed elements as necessary.A link with <div> tags:A link with <a> tags:This can be done in many ways.\na.

However, depending on the implementation there are some workarounds:At least one version of MD considers <div> to be a block level tag but <DIV> is just text.  All broswers however are case insensitive.  This allows you to keep the syntax simplicity of MD, at the cost of adding div container tags.So the following is a workaround:The downside of this is that the output code has <p> tags wrapping the <div> lines (both of them, the first because it's not  and the second because it doesn't match.  No browser fusses about this that I've found, but the code won't validate.  MD tends to put in spare <p> tags anyway.Several versions of markdown implement the convention <tag markdown=\"1\"> in which case MD will do the normal processing inside the tag.  The above example becomes:The current version of Fletcher's MultiMarkdown allows attributes to follow the link if using referenced links.In slim markdown use this:Translates to:It should also be mentioned that <span> tags allow inside them -- block-level items negate MD natively inside them unless you configure them not to do so, but in-line styles natively allow MD within them. As such, I often do something akin to...I am not 100% sure if this is universal but seems to be the case in all MD editors I've used.If you just need a selector for Javascript purposes (like I did), you might just want to use a href attribute instead of a class or id:Just do this:Markdown will not ignore or remove the href attribute like it does with classes and ids.So in your Javascript or jQuery you can then do:At least this works in my version of Markdown..."},

Is there a better way to do this?Pedantic answer: No.As you've already put on another comment, it's invalid to nest a div inside an a tag.However, there's nothing preventing you from making your a tag behave very similarly to a div, with the exception that you cannot nest other block tags inside it. If it suits your markup, set display:block on your a tag and size / float it however you like.If you renege on your question's premise that you need to avoid javascript, as others have pointed our you can use the onClick event handler. jQuery is a popular choice for making this easy and maintainable.Update:In HTML5, placing a <div> inside an <a> is valid.See http://dev.w3.org/html5/markup/a.html#a-changes (thanks Damien)It is possible to make a link fill the entire div which gives the appearance of making the div clickable.CSS:HTML:Without JS, I am doing it like this:My HTML:My CSS:My solution without JavaScript/images. Only CSS used. It works in all browsers.HTML:CSS:There is an example on https://www.redracingparts.com/english/motorbikesmotorcycles/stackoverflow/examples/div/clickable.phpNesting block level elements in anchors is not invalid anymore in HTML5. See http://html5doctor.com/block-level-links-in-html-5/ and http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/the-a-element.html.\nI'm not saying you should use it, but in HTML5 it's fine to use <a href=\"#\"><div></div></a>.The accepted answer is otherwise the best one. Using JavaScript like others suggested is also bad because it would make the \"link\" inaccessible (to users without JavaScript, which includes search engines and others).jQuery would allow you to do that.Look up the click() function:\nhttp://api.jquery.com/click/Example:Well you could either add <a></a> tags and place the div inside it, adding an href if you want the div to act as a link. Or else just use Javascript and define an 'OnClick' function. But from the limited information provided, it's a bit hard to determine what the context of your problem is.Something like this? AFAIK you will need at least a little bit of JavaScript...I would suggest to use jQuery.You can include this library in one line. And then you can access your div withand respond to the click event.we are using like this using tag and catching is with hope this helps."},

I however want the \"Next\" button to be triggered when the user submits the form via the Enter button. It is kind of like setting it as the default submit button, even though there are other buttons before it.My suggestion is don't fight this behaviour. You can effectively alter the order using floats. For example:with:will effectively reverse the order and thus the \"Next\" button will be the value triggered by hitting enter.This kind of technique will cover many circumstances without having to resort to more hacky JavaScript methods.The first button is always the default; it can't be changed. Whilst you can try to fix it up with JavaScript, the form will behave unexpectedly in a browser without scripting, and there are some usability/accessibility corner cases to think about. For example, the code linked to by Zoran will accidentally submit the form on Enter press in a <input type=\"button\">, which wouldn't normally happen, and won't catch IE's behaviour of submitting the form for Enter press on other non-field content in the form. So if you click on some text in a <p> in the form with that script and press Enter, the wrong button will be submitted... especially dangerous if, as given in that example, the real default button is ‘Delete’!My advice would be to forget about using scripting hacks to reassign defaultness. Go with the flow of the browser and just put the default button first. If you can't hack the layout to give you the on-screen order you want, then you can do it by having a dummy invisible button first in the source, with the same name/value as the button you want to be default:(note: positioning is used to push the button off-screen because display: none and visibility: hidden have browser-variable side-effects on whether the button is taken as default and whether it's submitted.)Set type=submit to the button you'd like to be default and type=button to other buttons. Now in the form below you can hit Enter in any input fields, and the Render button will work (despite the fact it is the second button in the form). Example:Tested in FF24 and Chrome 35.Quick'n'dirty you could create an hidden duplicate of the submit-button, which should be used, when pressing enter.If someone now hits enter in your form, the (hidden) next-button will be used as submitter.Tested on IE9, Firefox, Chrome and OperaIf you're using jQuery, this solution from a comment made here is pretty slick:Just add class=\"default\" to the button you want to be the default. It puts a hidden copy of that button right at the beginning of the form.I'm resurrecting this because I was researching a non-JavaScript way to do this. I wasn't into the key handlers, and the CSS positioning stuff was causing tab ordering to break since CSS repositioning doesn't change tab order. My solution is based on the response at https://stackoverflow.com/a/9491141. The solution source is below. tabindex is used to correct tab behaviour of the hidden button, as well as aria-hidden to avoid having the button read out by screen readers / identified by assistive devices. 1st button in DOM\n  2nd button in DOM\n  3rd button in DOMEssential CSS for this solution:Another solution, using jQuery:This should work on the following forms, making \"Update\" the default action:As well as:This traps the Enter key only when an input field on the form has focus.You should not be using buttons of the same name.  It's bad semantics.  Instead, you should modify your backend to look for different name values being set:Since I don't know what language you are using on the backend, I'll give you some pseudocode:bobince's solution has the downside of creating a button which can be Tab-d over, but otherwise unusable. This can create confusion for keyboard users.A different solution is to use the little-known form attribute:This is standard HTML, however unfortunately not supported in Internet Explorer."},

Or \"2\" to minimize file size?SVG profilesNote: SVG Tiny does not reduce the file size, it's just a subset of SVG that is adequate for low processing power devices. It will discard gradients, opacity, embedded fonts and filters. Erik Dahlström says: All SVG 1.1 full viewers should be able to display all of the SVG 1.1 Tiny/Basic content (according to spec), and probably all of the SVG 1.2 Tiny content that Illustrator produces too.Fonts note: if you don't have any text in your image this setting doesn't matter.Subsetting:Images: this only matters if you are including bitmap imagesNote that linked bitmap images won't display if the SVG is displayed through the <img> tag, because img doesn't allow loading external resources. Furthermore: webkit has a bug that does not display bitmap images within svg files even if you embed them. In short: use a plain <svg> tag if you intend to embed or link bitmap images, don't use <img>.Preserve Illustrator Editing CapabilitiesI prefer to save an .ai file as my source image, and to think of the SVG file as an Export for web feature. That way you focus on reducing file size and have a pristine copy of your vector file with all the editing capabilities. So don't choose this.Decimal PlacesThe default 3 is a sane setting and you can mostly forget about it. However, if you have a really complicated paths with many points lowering this setting to 1 or even 0 will reduce the file size substantially. But you must be careful because bezier segments are very sensitive to this setting and they might seem a little distorted. So if you lower this setting always make sure it looks acceptable in a browser. EncodingThe explanation behind character encoding is rather technical, and it only concerns svg files with text. The most likely encoding you need is UTF-8, do not change this unless you know what you're doing. Optimize for Adobe SVG ViewerAdobe SVG Viewer is a browser plugin from times when browsers did not support SVG natively. I don't know what it does, but it is irrelevant, do not check this.Include slicing dataThis adds metadata bloat to your SVG file, unless you plan on opening your SVG file later in Illustrator and finding your slices (if you have them), do not check thisInclude XMPMore metadata regarding the file, you can read on XMP here. do not check thisOutput fewer <tspan> elementsThis will be grayed out if you don't have text. SVG does not support kerning tables, so, certain character sequences will seem too spaced out, i.e. AVA. Illustrator works around by adding tspan elements and tweaking character positions a bit. This adds a bit of bloat to the file do not check this unless you care more about file size than text appearance.Use <textpath> element for text on a pathThis will be grayed out if you don't have text on a path. Browsers tend to vary a lot when it comes to placing text on a path, so Illustrator tries to be helpful by applying the rotation and position to the character instead of leaving the job to the browser. do not check this unless you care more about file size than text appearance.In general, I'd recommend you to look into SVG in general, you will find that it looks a lot like HTML and it allows you to tweak things that cannot be done within Illustrator."},

Thanks!put overflow:auto in the parent div\nsee more in this linkI don't have a solid explanation on why this happens, but I've fixed this by changing the top-margin to top-padding, or adding display: inline-block to the element style.EDIT: This is my theoryI have a feeling it has something to do with how margins are collapsed (combined).from W3C Collapsing Margins:My theory is that since your first element is next to the body the two margins combine and are applied to the body: this forces the body's content to start below the applied collapsed margin in compliance with the box model.There are situations where the margins do not collapse which might be worth playing around with (from Collapsing Margins):This are some of the ways to avoid margin collapsing between parent-child elements. Use the one that fits better with the rest of your styling:I know this is an old issue, I've come across it many times. The problem is that all of the fixes here are hacks that would potentially have unintended consequences. First off, there's an easy explanation for the root problem. Due to the way that margin collapsing works, if the first element inside a container has a top margin, that top margin is effectively applied to the parent container itself. You can test this on your own by doing the following:In a debugger, open this up and hover the div. You'll notice that the div itself actually is placed where the top-margin of the H1 element stops. This behavior is intended by the browser.So there's an easy fix to this without having to resort to strange hacks, as most of the posts here do (no insults intended, its just the truth) - simply go back to the original explanation - ...if the first element inside a container has a top margin... - Following that, you'd therefore need the first element in a container to NOT have a top margin. Okay, but how do you do that without adding elements that don't interfere semantically with your document?Easy! Pseudo-elements! You could do this via a class or a pre-defined mixin. Add a :before pseudo-element:CSS via a class:With this, following the above markup example you would modify your div as such:Why does this work?The first element in a container, if it has no top-margin, sets the position of the start of the next element's top margin. By adding a :before pseudo-element, the browser actually adds a non-semantic (in other words, good for SEO) element into the parent container before your first element.Q. Why the height: .0000001em?A. A height is required for the browser to push the margin element down. This height is effectively zero, but it will still allow you to add padding to the parent container itself. Since it's effectively zero, it won't have an effect on the layout of the container, either. Beautiful.Now you can add a class (or better, in SASS/LESS, a mixin!) to fix this problem instead of adding weird display styles that will cause unexpected consequences when you want to do other things with your elements, purposefully eliminating margins on elements and/or replacing it with padding, or strange position/float styles that really aren't intended to resolve this issue.display: flex will work in this case. Give parent element display: flex; and then give margin as per your requirement to the h1 tag.  Run into this issue today.overflow: hidden didn't worked as expected when I had more elements followed.So I tried changing the parent div's display property and display: flex worked !!!Hope this may help someone. :)Adding a tiny bit of padding to the parent element top can fix this issue.This is useful if you need an element inside the parent to be visible outside the parent element, like if you are creating an overlapping effect.This happens because of margin collapse.\nWhen child element touches the boundary of parent element and any of them applied with margins then :Solutions"},

I've tested this in IE7+ and the other major browsers.I had the same problem and non of the given answers worked. But I found a git commit with a fix that did work for me:keep it easy:[font-size dependent on your individual type-face]I prefer to use length on the vertical-align.

The factors are: line height, size of the superscript in relation to the regular font, the line height of the superscript and last but not least what is the bottom of the superscript aligning with...\nIf you set... the line height of regular text to be in a \"tunnel band\" (that's what I call it) of 135% then regular text (the 100%) gets white padded by 35% of more white. For a paragraph this looks like this:If you then do not white pad the superscript...(i.e. keep its line height to 0) the superscript only has the width of its own text... if you then ask the superscript to be a percentage of the regular font (for example 70%) and you align it with the middle of the regular text (text-middle), you can eliminate the problem and get a superscript that looks like a superscript. Here it is: I prefer the solution suggested here, as exemplified by this jsfiddle:CSS:HTML:The beauty of this solution is that you can tailor the vertical positioning of the superscript and subscript, to avoid any clashes with the line above or below... in the above, just increase or decrease the 0.2em to suit your requirements.To make all lines taller, to look the same as the line with the superscript, define a larger line-height for the entire paragraphor whatever value gives the effect you desire.It may look strange, but that's how you described your requirements.EDIT: In order to make all lines look the same when only one needs more vertical space than the others, ALL lines in the paragraph will have to be taller.This, as I said, may not an attractive solution. Maybe something can be done with a span making just the text with the sub/superscript smaller, apart from that I don't believe what you want can be achieved. But I'd like to see someone else's solution.EDIT2: Incidentally, I've tried a small html file containingAnd the lines are all the same height in FF3.0.14 and Konqueror (I can't speak for other browsers)I've been using line-height: normal for the superscript, which works fine for me in Safari, Chrome, and Firefox, but I'm not sure about IE. Specially use this on newsletter -I like Milingu Kilu's solution but in the same spirit I prefer&sup1, &sup2 etc. might do the trick. it's an HTML trick to superscriptAnswer from here, works in both phantomjs and in email-embedded HTML:"},

So, both backgroundColor and background-color will get the job done.Additionally, when you call .css() with arguments you have two choices as to what the arguments can be. They can either be 2 comma separated strings representing a css property and its value, or it can be a Javascript object containing one or more key value pairs of CSS properties and values.In conclusion the only thing wrong with your code is a missing }. The line should read:You cannot leave the curly brackets out, but you may leave the quotes out from around backgroundColor and color. If you use background-color you must put quotes around it because of the hyphen.In general, it's a good habit to quote your Javascript objects, since problems can arise if you do not quote an existing keyword.A final note is that about the jQuery .ready() methodis synonymous with:as well as with a third not recommended form.This means that $(init) is completely correct, since init is the handler in that instance. So, init will be fired when the DOM is constructed.When you are using Multiple css property with jQuery then you must use the curly Brace in starting and in the end. You are missing the ending curly brace.You can have a look at this jQuery CSS Selector tutorial. Just wanted to add that when using numbers for values with the css method you have to add them outside the apostrophe and then add the CSS unit in apostrophes.orThe .css() method makes it super simple to find and set CSS properties and combined with other methods like .animate(), you can make some cool effects on your site.In its simplest form, the .css() method can set a single CSS property for a particular set of matched elements. You just pass the property and value as strings and the element’s CSS properties are changed.$('.example').css('background-color', 'red');This would set the ‘background-color’ property to ‘red’ for any element that had the class of ‘example’.But you aren’t limited to just changing one property at a time. Sure, you could add a bunch of identical jQuery objects, each changing just one property at a time, but this is making several, unnecessary calls to the DOM and is a lot of repeated code.Instead, you can pass the .css() method a Javascript object that contains the properties and values as key/value pairs. This way, each property will then be set on the jQuery object all at once.This will change all of these CSS properties on the ‘.example’ elements.$(\".radioValue\").css({\"background-color\":\"-webkit-linear-gradient(#e9e9e9,rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.43137254901960786),#e9e9e9)\",\"color\":\"#454545\",    \"padding\": \"8px\"});wrong code:$(\"#myParagraph\").css({\"backgroundColor\":\"black\",\"color\":\"white\");its  missing   \"}\" after white\"change it to this"},

You can either float an element and allow the browser to position it relative to its parent container, or you can specify an absolute position and force the element to appear in a certain position regardless of its parent. If you want an absolutely-positioned element to appear on the right side of the screen, you can use position: absolute; right: 0;, but this will cause the element to always appear on the right edge of the screen regardless of how wide its parent div is (so it won't be \"at the right of its parent div\").You can use \"translateX(-100%)\" and \"text-align: right\" if your absolute element is \"display: inline-block\"You will get absolute-element aligned to the right relative its parentPerhaps you should divide your content like such using floats:Notice the overflow: auto;, this is to ensure that you have some height to your container.

The point of the semantics is to allow segregation of a bunch of child elements into repeating groups (edit - thanks BoltClock) or into a first part of some fixed length, followed by \"the rest\".  You sort-of want the opposite of that, which is what nth-last-child gives you.If you are using jQuery in your project, or are willing to include it you can call nth-last-child through its selector API (this is this simulated it will cross browser). Here is a link to an nth-last-child plugin.  If you took this method of targeting the elements you were interested in:And then style again the last class instead of the nth-child or nth-last-child pseudo selectors, you will have a much more consistent cross browser experience.

This avoids the need to set width: 100% by locking it to the left and right sides of the parent element.Try using percentages for your padding:If you're worried about users on old browsers who can't see the box-shadow, just give the input a subtle background colour as backup. If you're using pixels for this sort of thing, then the chances are you're using them elsewhere, which could present a few extra-challenges, let me know if you encounter them.Only thing I know to prevent this is assign values like that 100%-10.

In IE9, it is possible with purely a hack as advised by @Spudley.  Since you've customized height and width of the div and select, you need to change div:before css to match yours.In case if it is IE10 then using below css3 it is possibleHowever if you're interested in jQuery plugin, try Chosen.js or you can create your own in js.I would suggest mine solution that you can find  in this GitHub repo.\nThis works also for IE8 and IE9 with a custom arrow that comes from an icon font.Examples of Custom Cross Browser Drop-down in action: check them with all your browsers to see the cross-browser feature.Anyway, let's start with the modern browsers and then we will see the solution for the older ones.For these browser, it is easy to set the same background image for the drop-down in order to have the same arrow.To do so, you have to reset the browser's default style for the select tag and set new background rules (like suggested before).The appearance rules are set to none to reset browsers default ones, if you want to have the same aspect for each arrow, you should keep them in place.The background rules in the examples are set with SVG inline images that represent different arrows. They are positioned 98% from left to keep some margin to the right border (you can easily modify the position as you wish).In order to maintain the correct cross-browser behavior, the only other rule that have to be left in place is the outline. This rule resets the default border that appears (in some browsers) when the element is clicked. All the others rules can be easily modified if needed.This is the harder part... Or maybe not.There is no standard rule to hide the default arrows for these browsers (like the select::-ms-expand for IE10+). The solution is to hide the part of the drop-down that contains the default arrow and insert an arrow icon font (or a SVG, if you prefer) similar to the SVG that is used in the other browsers (see the select CSS rule for more details about the inline SVG used).The very first step is to set a class that can recognize the browser: this is the reason why I have used the conditional IE IFs at the beginning of the code. These IFs are used to attach specific classes to the html tag to recognize the older IE browser.After that, every select in the HTML have to be wrapped by a div (or whatever tag that can wraps an element). At this wrapper just add the class that contains the icon font.In easy words, this wrapper is used to simulate the select tag.To act like a drop-down, the wrapper must have a border, because we hide the one that comes from the select.Notice that we cannot use the select border because we have to hide the default arrow lengthening it 25% more than the wrapper. Consequently its right border should not be visible because we hide this 25% more by the overflow: hidden rule applied to the select itself.The custom arrow icon-font is placed in the pseudo class :before where the rule content contains the reference for the arrow (in this case it is a right parenthesis).We also place this arrow in an absolute position to center it as much as possible (if you use different icon fonts, remember to adjust them opportunely by changing top and left values and the font size).You can easily create and substitute the background arrow or the icon font arrow, with every one that you want simply changing it in the background-image rule or making a new icon font file by yourself.In case you want to use the class and pseudo-class:.simple-control is your css class:disabled is pseudo class"},

In your case you just have to override default variable '$input-btn-focus-box-shadow' from '_variables.scss' file. Like so: \n$input-btn-focus-box-shadow: none;\nNote that you need to override that variable in your own custom '_yourCusomVarsFile.scss'.

So i came up with an optimal solution:Hope this helps...Here's a non-CSS method. Using JQuery, simply remove the \"focus\" class whenever the element is has been clicked.$(\".btn\").mousemove(function(element) {\n    $(this).removeClass(\"focus\");\n});This method may cause the border to flash into existence and then back out briefly, which doesn't look bad in my opinion (it looks like part of the response when the button is clicked).The reason I used .mousemove() is that .click() and .mouseup() both proved to be ineffective.Changing these values worked for me.

How can I make the <body> element fill the entire page, always?On our site we have pages where the content is static, and pages where it is loaded in with AJAX. On one page (a search page), there were cases when the AJAX results would more than fill the page, and cases where it would return no results. In order for the background image to fill the page in all cases we had to apply the following CSS:height for the html and min-height for the body.As none of the other answers worked for me, I decided to post this as an answer for others looking for a solution who also found the same problem. Both the html and body needed to be set with min-height or the gradient would not fill the body height.I found Stephen P's comment to provide the correct answer to this.When I have the html (or the html and body) height set to 100%,I had to apply 100% to both html and body.Try using viewport (vh, vm) units of measure at the body levelhtml, body { margin: 0; padding: 0; }\nbody { min-height: 100vh; }Use vh units for horizontal margins, paddings, and borders on the body and subtract them from the min-height value.I've had bizarre results using vh,vm units on elements within the body, especially when re-sizing.I think the largely correct way, is to set css to this:I tried all the solutions above and I'm not discrediting any of them, but in my case, they didn't work.For me, the problem was caused because the <header> tag had a margin-top of 5em and the <footer> had a margin-bottom of 5em. I removed them and instead put some padding (top and bottom, respectively). I'm not sure if replacing the margin was an ideal fix to the problem, but the point is that, if the first and last elements in your <body> has some margins, you might want to look into it and remove them.My html and body tags had the following stylesIf you have a border or padding, then the solutionproduces the imperfect renderingTo get it right in the presence of a border or paddinguse insteadas Martin pointed out, although overflow: hidden is not needed.(2018 - tested with Chrome 69 and IE 11)This works for me: "},

Dynamic stylesheet-fiddling is rarely done because it's quite annoying to get right, rarely needed, and historically troublesome.I threw together a small library for this since I do think there are valid use cases for manipulating stylesheets in JS. Reasons being:A function to cope with the cross-browser stuff:My trick is using an attribute selector. Attributes are easier to set up by javascript. cssjavascripthtmlJust place the css in a template string.Then create a style element and place the string in the style tag and attach it to the document.Specificity will take care of the rest. Then you can remove and add style tags dynamically. This is a simple alternative to libraries and messing with the stylesheet array in the DOM. Happy Coding!There is another alternative.  Instead of manipulating the pseudo-classes directly, create real classes that model the same things, like a \"hover\" class or a \"visited\" class.  Style the classes with the usual \".\" syntax and then you can use JavaScript to add or remove classes from an element when the appropriate event fires.Instead of directly setting pseudo-class rules with javascript, you can set the rules differently in different CSS files, and then use Javascript to switch one stylesheet off and to switch another on. A method is described at A List Apart (qv. for more detail).Set up the CSS files as,And then switch between them using javascript:As already stated this is not something that browsers support.If you aren't coming up with the styles dynamically (i.e. pulling them out of a database or something) you should be able to work around this by adding a class to the body of the page.The css would look something like:And the javascript to change this would be something like:Switching stylesheets in and out is the way to do it.

Negative padding might help in such situations.I recently answered a different question where I discussed why the box model is the way it is.There are specific reasons for each part of the box model. Padding is meant to extend the background beyond its contents. If you need to shrink the background of the container, you should make the parent container the correct size and give the child element some negative margins. In this case the content is not being padded, it's overflowing.Padding by definition is a positive integer (including 0).Negative padding would cause the border to collapse into the content (see the box-model page on w3) - this would make the content area smaller than the content, which doesn't make sense.I would like to describe a very good example of why negative padding would be useful and awesome.As all of us CSS developers know, vertically aligning a dynamically sizing div within another is a hassle, and for the most part, viewed as being impossible only using CSS. The incorporation of negative padding could change this.Please review the following HTML:With the following CSS, we would be able to vertically center the content of the inner div within the outer div:Allow me to explain...Absolutely positioning the inner div's top at 50% places the top edge of the inner div at the center of the outer div. Pretty simple. This is because percentage based positioning is relative to the inner dimensions of the parent element.Percentage based padding, on the other hand, is based on the inner dimensions of the targeted element. So, by applying the property of padding-top: -50%; we have shifted the content of the inner div upward by a distance of 50% of the height of the inner div's content, therefore centering the inner div's content within the outer div and still allowing the height dimension of the inner div to be dynamic!If you ask me OP, this would be the best use-case, and I think it should be implemented just so I can do this hack. lol. Or, they should just fix the functionality of vertical-align and give us a version of vertical-align that works on all elements.This could help, by the way:The box-sizing CSS property is used to alter the default CSS box model used to calculate widths and heights of elements.http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-ui/#box-sizing \nhttps://developer.mozilla.org/En/CSS/Box-sizingYou asked WHY, not how to cheat it:Usually because of laziness of programmers of the initial implementation, because they HAVE already put way more effort in other features, delivering more odd side-effects like floats, because they were more requested by designers back then and yet they haven't taken the time to allow this so we can use the FOUR properties to push/pull an element against its neighbors (now we only have four to push, and only 2 to pull).When html was designed, magazines loved text reflown around images back then, now hated because today we have touch trends, and love squary things with lots of space and nothing to read. That's why they put more pressure on floats than on centering, or they could have designed something like margin-top: fill; or margin: average 0; to simply align the content to the bottom, or distribute its extra space around.In this case I think it hasn't been implemented because of the same reason that makes CSS to lack of a :parent pseudo-selector: To prevent looping evaluations.Without being an engineer, I can see that CSS right now is made to paint elements once, remember some properties for future elements to be painted, but NEVER going back to already-painted elements.That's why (I guess) padding is calculated on the width, because that's the value that was available at the time of starting to paint it.If you had a negative value for padding, it would affect the outer limits, which has ALREADY been defined when the margin has already been set. I know, nothing has been painted yet, but when you read how the painting process goes, created by geniuses with 90's technology, I feel like I am asking dumb questions and just say \"thanks\" hehe.One of the requirements of web pages is that they are quickly available, unlike an app that can take its time and eat the computer resources to get everything correct before displaying it, web pages need to use little resources (so they are fit in every device possible) and be scrolled in a breeze.If you see applications with complex reflowing and positioning, like InDesign, you can't scroll that fast! It takes a big effort both from processors and graphic card to jump to next pages!So painting and calculating forward and forgetting about an element once drawn, for now it seems to be a MUST.Fitting an Iframe inside containers will not match the size of the container.  It adds about 20px of padding.  Currently there is no easy way to fix this.  You need javascript (http://css-tricks.com/snippets/jquery/fit-iframe-to-content/)Negative margins would be an easy solution.Because the designers of CSS didn't have the foresight to imagine the flexibility this would bring. There are plenty of reasons to expand the content area of a box without affecting its relationship to neighbouring elements. If you think it's not possible, put some long nowrap'd text in a box, set a width on the box, and watch how the overflowed content does nothing to the layout.Yes, this is still relevant with CSS3 in 2019; case in point: flexbox layouts. Flexbox items' margins do not collapse, so in order to space them evenly and align them with the visual edge of the container, one must subtract the items' margins from their container's padding. If any result is < 0, you must use a negative margin on the container, or sum that negative with the existing margin. I.e. the content of the element effects how one defines the margins for it, which is backwards. Summing doesn't work cleanly when flex elements' content have margins defined in different units or are affected by a different font-size, etc.The example below should, ideally have aligned and evenly spaced grey boxes but, sadly they aren't.I have encountered enough of these little issues over the years where a little negative padding would have gone a long way, but instead I'm forced to add non-semantic markup, use calc(), or CSS preprocessors which only work when the units are the same, etc."},

For example, if I have a parent div that's 1000px tall, and a child div that is at 100% height, then that child div could theoretically be much taller than the height of the viewport, or much smaller than the height of the viewport, even though that div is set at 100% height.If I instead make that child div set at 100vh, then it'll only fill up 100% of the height of the viewport, and not necessarily the parent div.I know the question is very old and @Josh Beam addressed the biggest difference, but there's still another one:Suppose you have a <div>, direct child of <body> that you want filling the whole viewport, so you use width: 100vw; height: 100vh;. It all works just the same as width: 100%; height: 100vh; until you add more content and a vertical scrollbar shows up. Since the vw account for the scrollbar as part of the viewport, width: 100vw; will be slightly bigger than width: 100%;. This little difference ends up adding a horizontal scrollbar (required for the user to see that little extra width) and by consequence, the height would also be a little different on both cases.That must be taken into consideration when deciding which one to use, even if the parent element size is the same as the document viewport size.Example:Using width:100vw;:Using width:100%;:the vw (view-width) and vh (view-height) units are relational to the view-port size, where 100vw or vh is 100% of the view-port's width/height. For example, \nif a view-port is 1600px wide, and you specify something as being 2vw, that will be the equivalent of 2% of the view-port width, or 32px.% unit is always based on the parent element width of the current elementThank you for your answer and code example, @IanC.  It helped me a lot.  A clarification:  I believe you meant \"scrollbar\" when you wrote \"sidebar.\"  Here are some related discussions about viewport units counting scrollbars that I also found helpful:The W3C spec for the vw, vh, vmin, vmax units (the \"viewport percentage lengths\") says \"any scrollbars are assumed not to exist\".Apparently Firefox subtracts scrollbar width from 100vw, as @Nolonar's comment at Difference between Width:100% and width:100vw? observes, citing \"Can I Use\". Can I Use, perhaps in tension with the spec (?), says all browsers other than Firefox currently \"incorrectly\" consider 100vw to be the entire page width including the vertical scroll bar.There is a difference that has not necessarily been raised. 100vw includes the width of the scrool bar, while 100% does not include it. It is a small difference, but important when doing design."},

This will place the child content at the bottom of the parent element, assuming the parent element has a height greater than the child element.There is no need to try and calculate a value for margin-top when you have a height on your parent element or another element greater than your child element of interest within your parent element.Based on the other answers here is an even more responsive version. I made changes from Ivan's version to support viewports <768px wide and to better support slow window resizes.This is based on cfx's solution, but rather than setting the font size to zero in the parent container to remove the inter-column spaces added because of the display: inline-block and having to reset them, I simply added to the column divs to compensate.Well, I didn't like any of those answers, my solution of the same problem was to add this:<div>&nbsp;</div>.

Clicking on the menu button expands the menu but if I click (or touch for that matter) on a menu link, the menu stays open. What do I have to do, to close it again? Bootstrap's default setting is to keep the menu open when you click on a menu item. You can manually override this behaviour by calling .collapse('hide'); on the jQuery element that you want to collapse.Just to share this from solutions on GitHub, this was the popular answer:https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/issues/9013#issuecomment-39698247This is wired to the document, so you don't have to do it on ready() (you can dynamically append links to your menu and it will still work), and it only gets called if the menu is already expanded.  Some people have reported weird flashing where the menu opens and then immediately closes with other code that did not verify that the menu had the \"in\" class.[UPDATE 2014-11-04] apparently when using sub-menus, the above can cause problems, so the above got modified to:Change this: to this:This simple change worked for me.Ref: https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/issues/9013I had the same problem but caused by including twice bootstrap.js and jquery.js files.On a single click the event was processed twice by both jquery instances. One closed and one opened the toggle.This would help in handling drop down in nav barI am having/had similar issues with Bootstrap 4, alpha-6, and Joakim Johanssons answer above started me in the right direction.  No javascript required.  Putting data-target=\".navbar-collapse\" and data-toggle=\"collapse\" into the div tag inside the nav, but surrounding the links/buttons, worked for me.I know this question is for Bootstrap 3 but if you are looking solution for Bootstrap 4, just do this:I had the same problem, I was using jQuery-1.7.1 and bootstrap 3.2.0.\nI changed my jQuery version to the latest (jquery-1.11.2) version and everything works well.I did Though the solution posted earlier to change the menu item itself, like below, works when the menu is on a small device, it has a side effect when the menu is on full width and expanded, this can result in a horizontal scrollbar sliding over your menu items. The javascript solutions do not have this side-effect. (sorry for answering like this, wanted to add a comment to that answer, but, seems I haven't sufficient credit to make remarks )In case you want to manually override this behaviour by calling .collapse('hide') within an angular's directive, here is the code:javascript file:Html:\nPlease make sure You are using latest bootstrap js version. I was facing the same problem and just upgrading the bootstrap.js file from bootstrap-3.3.6 did the magic.If you only want your navigation to toggle when used on a mobile screen, just adding data-toggle=\"collapse\" and data-target=\"#navbar\" to your a elements will work on the mobile screen, but will give you a weird flicker when clicked on a desktop screen. The jQuery solutions do not work well if you are in an Aurelia or Angular environment.The best solution for me was to create a custom attribute that listens to the corresponding media query and adds in the data-toggle=\"collapse\"attribute if desired:<a href=\"#\" ... collapse-toggle-if-less768 data-target=\"#navbar\"> ...The custom attribute with Aurelia looks like this:I found that after much struggle, trial and error, the best solution for me on jsfiddle.  Link to inspiration on jsfiddle.net.  I am using bootstrap's navbar navbar-fixed-top with collapse and hamburger toggle.  Here is my version on jsfiddle: jsfiddle Scrollspy navbar.  I was only getting basic functionality using the instructions on getbootsrap.com.  For me, the problem was mostly in the vague directions and js recommended by the getbootstrap site.  The best part was that adding this extra bit of js (which does include some of what is mentioned in the above threads) solved several Scrollspy issues for me including:NOTE:  In the js code shown below (from the second jsfiddle link in my post):topMenu = $(\"#myScrollspy\"),...the value \"myScrollspy\" must match it the id=\"\" in your HTML like so...Of course you can change that value to whatever value you like.All you need is data-target=\".navbar-collapse\" in the button, nothing else.This is the code that worked for me:I had the same problem, ensure that bootstrap.js is included in your html page. In my case the menu opened but did not close. As soon as I included the bootstrap js file, everything just worked.Simple Try to make a function in javascript for dropdown collapse class.Example:JS:Hook this function to onClick simple works for me.I had the similar issue but mine wouldn't stay open it would open/close quickly, I found that I had jquery-1.11.1.min.js loading before bootstrap.min.js. So I reversed the order of those 2 files and fixed my menu. Runs flawlessly now. Hope it helpsThe problem could be you are using out of date versions of bootstrap or jquery, OR you are calling more than one version in your markup. Just keep the latest versions, you only need the one reference. Solves the problem.you may want to just ensure you're loading your jQuery and Bootstrap.min.js ATF. Your navigation is the first thing to render on the page, so if you have your scripts in the bottom of your HTML, you're losing any JavaScript functionality.I had the same issue only on mobile but for an Angular application and this is what I did: \napp.component.htmlapp.component.ts\nHope it helps :)My menu is not a navbar standard one, but i managed to auto collapse mine, using an \"onclick\" function and a \".click()\"."},

Is it possible to override an !important style using javascript.This is for a greasemonkey extension, if that makes a difference.I believe the only way to do this it to add the style as a new CSS declaration with the '!important' suffix. The easiest way to do this is to append a new <style> element to the head of document:The rules added with the above method will (if you use the !important suffix) override other previously set styling. If you're not using the suffix then make sure to take concepts like 'specificity' into account.There are a couple of simple one-liners you can use to do this.1) Set a  \"style\" attribute on the element:or...2) Modify the cssText property of the style object:Either will do the job.===BTW - if you want a useful tool to manipulate !important rules in elements, I've written a jQuery plugin called \"important\": http://github.com/premasagar/importantelement.style has a setProperty method that can take the priority as a third parameter:It didn't work in old IEs but it should be fine in current browsers.Building on @Premasagar's excellent answer; if you don't want to remove all the other inline styles use this\nCan't use removeProperty() because it wont remove !important rules in Chrome.\nCan't use element.style[property] = '' because it only accepts camelCase in FireFox.\nBetter method I just discovered:  try to be more specific than the page CSS with your selectors.  I just had to do this today, and it works like a charm!

But here you need css like below. the added class css rule should be below your original rule.There we have another possibilty to remove a property value from the CSS.\nLike using the replace method in js. But you have to know exactly the ID of the style, or you can write a for loop to detecting that by(count styles on page, then check if any of those 'includes' or 'match' an \"!important\" value. & you can count also - how much contains them, or just simply write a global [regexp: /str/gi] replacing method.) Mine is very simple, but i attack a jsBin for example:First i set the body background in css for yellow !impoartant, then i overrided by JS for darkPink.Below is a snippet of code to set the important parameter for the style attribute using jquery.Usage is pretty simple.Just pass an object containing all the attributes you want to set as important.There are two additional options.1.To just add important parameter to already present style attribute pass empty string.2.To add important param for all attributes present dont pass anything.

I've tried all of the solutions presented here and I've done more searching on the internet for other possible solutions, and I think I've found one that's promising:Output:Instead of having to add the top, bottom, left, and right classes to every <td>, all I have to do is add top row to the top <tr>, bottom row to the bottom <tr>, and row to every <tr> in between.

The solution is to give the TR and TDs a specified width (either px or %).Of course you could make the selector tr.myClass if you wanted to apply it only to certain rows.  Apparently display: table doesn't work for IE 6/7, however, but there's probably other hacks (hasLayout?) that might work for those.  :-(Here's an approach using tbody elements that could be the way to do it. You can't set the border on a tbody (same as you can't on a tr) but you can set the background colour. If the effect you're wanting to acheive can be obtained with a background colour on the groups of rows instead of a border this will work.Group rows together using the <tbody> tag and then apply style.And the css in style.cssThe only other way I can think of to do it is to enclose each of the rows you need a border around in a nested table. That will make the border easier to do but will potentially creat other layout issues, you'll have to manually set the width on table cells etc. Your approach may well be the best one depending on your other layout rerquirements and the suggested approach here is just a possible alternative.Based on your requirement that you want to put a border around an arbitrary block of MxN cells there really is no easier way of doing it without using Javascript. If your cells are fixed with you can use floats but this is problematic for other reasons. what you're doing may be tedious but it's fine.Ok, if you're interested in a Javascript solution, using jQuery (my preferred approach), you end up with this fairly scary piece of code:I'll happily take suggestions on easier ways to do this...the trick is with outline property thanks to enigment's answer with little modificationuse this class then in the HTMLand the result is \n\nhope this helps youAn easier way is to make the table a server side control.

(See http://www.quirksmode.org/blog/archives/2012/07/more_about_devi.html .) I suggest using if (window.matchMedia('(max-device-width: 960px)').matches) {} on browsers supporting matchMedia.I just had this idea, so maybe it's shortsighted, but it seems to work well and might be the most consistent between your CSS and JS.In your CSS you set the max-width value for html based on the @media screen value:Then, using JS (probably via a framework like JQuery), you would just check the max-width value of the html tag:Now you can use this value to make conditional changes:If putting the max-width value on the html tag seems scary, then maybe you can put on a different tag, one that is only used for this purpose. For my purpose the html tag works fine and doesn't affect my markup.Useful if you are using Sass, etc: To return a more abstract value, such as breakpoint name, instead of px value you can do something like:Now you can act on same breakpoint names as you do in sass, e.g. sass: @include respond-to(xs), and js if ($breakpoint = \"xs) {}.What I especially like about this is that I can define my breakpoint names all in css and in one place (likely a variables scss document) and my js can act on them independently. var width = Math.max(window.screen.width, window.innerWidth);This should handle most scenarios. I think using window.devicePixelRatio is more elegant than the window.matchMedia solution:check it https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/matchMediayou can easily use document.documentElement.clientWidthLumia phones give wrong screen.width (at least on emulator).\nSo maybe Math.min(window.innerWidth || Infinity, screen.width) will work on all devices?Or something crazier:You should useIt is regarded as cross-browser compability, and is the same method that jQuery(window).width(); uses.For detailed information have a look at: https://ryanve.com/lab/dimensions/Ya mybe u can use document.documentElement.clientWidth to get the device width of client and keep tracking the device width by put on setIntervaljust like Just as an FYI, there is a library called breakpoints which detects the max-width as set in CSS and allows you to use it in JS if-else conditions using <=, <, >, >= and == signs.

My thought was to apply a param to the end of css and js files with the current version number:Two questions:  Will this effectively break the cache?  Will the param cause the browser to then never cache the response from that url since the param indicates that this is dynamic content?The param ?v=1.123 indicates a query string, and the browser will therefore think it is a new path from, say, ?v=1.0. Thus causing it to load from file, not from cache. As you want. And, the browser will assume that the source will stay the same next time you call ?v=1.123 and should cache it with that string. So it will remain cached, however your server is set up, until you move to ?v=1.124 or so on.Yes. Even Stack Overflow use this method, although I remember that they (with their millions of visitors per day and zillions of different client and proxy versions and configurations) have had some freak edge cases where even this was not enough to break the cache. But the general assumption is that this will work, and is a suitable method to break caching on clients.No. The parameter will not change the caching policy; the caching headers sent by the server still apply, and if it doesn't send any, the browser's defaults. It is safer to put the version number in the actual filename.  This allows multiple versions to exist at once so you can roll out a new version and if any cached HTML pages still exist that are requesting the older version, they will get the version that works with their HTML.Note, in one of the largest versioned deployments anywhere on the internet, jQuery uses version numbers in the actual filename and it safely allows multiple versions to co-exist without any special server-side logic (each version is just a different file).This busts the cache once when you deploy new pages and new linked files (which is what you want) and from then on those versions can be effectively cached (which you also want).As others have said, cache busting with a query param is usually considered a Bad Idea (tm), and has been for a long time. It's better to reflect the version in the file name. Html5 Boilerplate recommends against using the query string, among others.That said, of the recommendations I have seen which cited a source, all seem to take their wisdom from a 2008 article by Steve Souders. His conclusions are based on the behaviour of proxies at the time, and they may or may not be relevant these days. Still, in the absence of more current information, changing the file name is the safe option.It will bust the cache once, after the client has downloaded the resource every other response will be served from client cache unless:In general this should be fine, but it's possible for this to not work if there is an intermediate cache (a proxy) that is configured to ignore the request parameters.For example, if you are serving static content through Akamai CDN, it can be configured to ignore request parameters to prevent cache busting using this method.It very much depends on quite how robust you want your caching to be. For example, the squid proxy server (and possibly others) defaults to not caching URLs served with a querystring - at least, it did when that article was written. If you don't mind certain use cases causing unnecessary cache misses, then go ahead with query params. But it's very easy to set up a filename-based cache-busting scheme which avoids this problem.Found a comparison of the 2 techniques (query string vs file name) here: Version as a querystring has two problems. Another similar approach is to use htaccess mod_rewrite to ignore part of the path when serving the files. Your never-cached index page references the latest path to the files. From a development perspective it's as easy as using params for the version number, but it's as robust as the filename approach.Use the ignored part of the path for the version number, and the server just ignores it and serves the uncached file.  1.2.3/css/styles.css serves the same file as css/styles.css since the first directory is stripped and ignored by the htaccess fileNote that this approach means you need to disable caching of your index page - Using <meta> tags to turn off caching in all browsers?You could take the same approach on any server platform that allows url rewriting(rewrite condition adapted from mod_rewrite - rewrite directory to query string except /#!/)... and if you need cache busting for your index page / site entry point, you could always use JavaSript to refresh it. Hope this should help you to inject external JS fileSource - Cachebuster code in JavaScript"},

There were some other posts about people experiencing a similar issue with 3d transforms, but can't find anything about 2d transforms like this.Any ideas would be appreciated, thanks!I have have this problem a number of times and there seems to be 2 ways of fixing it (shown below). You can use either of these properties to fix the rendering, or both at the same time.Backface visibility hidden fixes the problem as it simplifies the animation to just the front of the object, whereas the default state is the front and the back.TranslateZ also works as it is a hack to add hardware acceleration to the animation. Both of these properties fix the problem that you are having but some people also like to add to their animated to object. I find that it can change the rendering of a web font but feel free to experiment with that method too.To improve the blurriness, esp. on Chrome, try doing this:UPDATE: Perspective adds distance between the user and the z-plane, which technically scales the object, making the blurriness seem 'permanent'. The perspective(1px) above is like duck-tape because we're matching the blurriness we're trying to solve. You might have better luck with the css below:I found that adjusting the scale ratio helped slightly.Using scale(1.048) over (1.05) seemed to generate a better approximation to a whole-pixel font size, reducing the sub-pixel blurring.I also used translateZ(0) which seems to adjust Chrome's final rounding step in the transform animation. This is a plus for my onhover usage because it increases speed and reduces visual noise. For an onclick function however, I wouldn't use it because, the transformed font doesn't appear to be as crispy.Instead of using fixes the text blurring problem in Chrome.After trying everything else here with no luck, what finally fixed this issue for me was removing the will-change: transform; property. For some reason it caused horribly blurry looking scaling in Chrome, but not Firefox.Sunderls lead me to the answer. Except filter: scale does not exist, but filter: blur does. Apply the next declarations to the elements that appear blurred (in my case they were inside a transformed element): It almost worked perfectly. \"Almost\" because i'm using a transition and while in transition, elements don't look perfect, but once the transition is done, they do. This must be a bug with Chrome (Version 56.0.2924.87), but the below fixes the bluriness for me when changing css properties in the console('.0'). I'll report it.I found out, that the problem occures on relative transforms in any way. translateX(50%), scale(1.1) or what ever. providing absolute values always works (does not produce blurry text(ures)).None of the solutions mentions here worked, and I think there is not solution, yet (using Chrome 62.0.3202.94 while I am writing this).In my case transform: translateY(-50%) translateX(-50%) causes the blur (I want to center a dialog).To reach a bit more \"absolute\" values, I had to set decimal values to transform: translateY(-50.09%) translateX(-50.09%).NOTEI am quite sure, that this values vary on different screen sizes. I just wanted to share my experiences, in case it helps someone. Try using zoom: 101%; for complex designs when you can't use a combination of zoom + scale.In my case following code caused blurry font:and just adding zoom property fixed it for me. Play around with zoom, following worked for me:Another fix to try i just found for blurry transforms (translate3d, scaleX) on Chrome is to set the element as \n\"display: inline-table;\". \nIt seems to force pixel rounding in some case (on the X axis).I read subpixel positioning under Chrome was intended and devs won't fix it.Adding perspective(1px) worked for me.toI have found a much better and clean solution:orThanks to this post:\nPreventing blurry rendering with transform: scale2019 UpdateThe Chrome display bug is still unfixed and though no fault of the patrons, none of the suggestions offered in the entirety of this website help to resolve the issue. I can concur that I have tried every single one of them in vain: only 1 comes close and that's the css rule: filter:blur(0); which eliminates the shifting of a container by 1px but does not resolve the blurred display bug of the container itself and any content it may have.Here's the reality: there literally is no fix to this problem so here is a work around for fluid websitesCASE\nI'm currently developing a fluid website and have 3 divs, all centered with hover effects and sharing percentage values in both the width and position. The Chrome bug occurs on the center container which is set to left:50%; and transform:translateX(-50%); a common setting.EXAMPLE: First the HTML...Here's the CSS where the Chrome bug occurs...Here's the fixed css...Bugged fiddle: https://jsfiddle.net/m9bgrunx/2/\nFixed fiddle: https://jsfiddle.net/uoc6e2dm/2/As you can see a small amount of tweaking to the CSS should reduce or eliminate the requirement to use transform for positioning. This could also apply to fixed width websites as well as fluid.I have this same problem. I fixed this using:None of above worked for me.\nI had this animation for popups:In my case blurry effect was gone after applying this rule:\n-webkit-perspective: 1000; even though it is marked as unused in Chrome inspector.None of the above worked for me.It worked when I added perspectiveie from transform : translate3d(-10px,-20px,0) scale3d(0.7,0.7, 1)i changed to transform : perspective(1px) translate3d(-10px,-20px,0) scale3d(0.7,0.7, 1)I fixed my case by adding:FOR CHORME:I´ve tried all suggestions here. But diden't work.\nMy college found a great solution, that works better:You should NOT scale past 1.0And include translateZ(0) in the hover but NOT in the none-hover/initial position.Example:I used a combination of all answers and this is what worked for me in the end:For me the problem was that my elements were using transformStyle: preserve-3d. I realized that this wasn't actually needed for the app and removing it fixed the blurriness.I removed this from my code -  transform-style: preserve-3d;\nand added this- transform: perspective(1px) translateZ(0);the blur went away!In Chrome 74.0.3729.169, current as of 5-25-19, there doesn't seem to be any fix for blurring occurring at certain browser zoom levels caused by the transform. Even a simple TransformY(50px) will blur the element. This doesn't occur in current versions of Firefox, Edge or Safari, and it doesn't seem to occur at all zoom levels.My solution was:display: initial;Then it was crispy sharp you can use css filter to fix this.about vendor-prefix, please do it by yourself.-webkit-filter,-ms-filter.\ndetail is here\nhttp://browser.colla.me/show/css_transformation_scale_cause_blurringThe text won't be blurry if you don't transition the transform.Just do this:Without the transition like\n    transition: all .2s;It's important to add that this issue arises if the element which is being translated has a height with an odd number of pixels. So, if you have control over the height of the element, setting it to an even number will make the content appear crisp"},

I'd use this as anecdotal evidence to say 'go ahead, implement it'.Some JavaScript code to do it, using Prototype (because that's what I'm familiar with):PS: Obviously this JavaScript code is very naive and not well tested, and you probably don't want to use it on textboxes with novels in them, but you get the general idea.One refinement to some of these answers is to let CSS do more of the work.The basic route seems to be:Here's another technique for autosizing a textarea.Code:\n(plain vanilla JavaScript)Demo:\n(uses jQuery, targets on the textarea I'm typing into right now - if you have Firebug installed, paste both samples into the console and test on this page)Probably the shortest solution:This way you don't need any hidden divs or anything like that.Note: you might have to play with this.style.height = (this.scrollHeight) + \"px\"; depending on how you style the textarea (line-height, padding and that kind of stuff).Here's a Prototype version of resizing a text area that is not dependent on the number of columns in the textarea. This is a superior technique because it allows you to control the text area via CSS as well as have variable width textarea. Additionally, this version displays the number of characters remaining. While not requested, it's a pretty useful feature and is easily removed if unwanted.Create the widget by calling new Widget.Textarea('element_id'). The default options can be overridden by passing them as an object, e.g. new Widget.Textarea('element_id', { max_length: 600, min_height: 50}). If you want to create it for all textareas on the page, do something like:Here is a solution with JQuery:abc is a teaxtarea.Check the below link:\nhttp://james.padolsey.com/javascript/jquery-plugin-autoresize/Just revisiting this, I've made it a little bit tidier (though someone who is full bottle on Prototype/JavaScript could suggest improvements?).Just it call with:I've made something quite easy. First I put the TextArea into a DIV. Second, I've called on the ready function to this script.Simple. It is the maximum height of the div once it is rendered, divided by the height of one TextArea of one row.I needed this function for myself, but none of the ones from here worked as I needed them.So I used Orion's code and changed it.I added in a minimum height, so that on the destruct it does not get too small.Like the answer of @memical.However I found some improvements. You can use the jQuery height() function. But be aware of padding-top and padding-bottom pixels. Otherwise your textarea will grow too fast.My solution not using jQuery (because sometimes they don't have to be the same thing) is below. Though it was only tested in Internet Explorer 7, so the community can point out all the reasons this is wrong:So far I really like how it's working, and I don't care about other browsers, so I'll probably apply it to all my textareas:Here is an extension to the Prototype widget that Jeremy posted on June 4th:It stops the user from entering more characters if you're using limits in textareas. It checks if there are characters left. If the user copies text into the textarea, the text is cut off at the max. length:@memical had an awesome solution for setting the height of the textarea on pageload with jQuery, but for my application I wanted to be able to increase the height of the textarea as the user added more content.  I built off memical's solution with the following:It's not very smooth but it's also not a client-facing application, so smoothness doesn't really matter.  (Had this been client-facing, I probably would have just used an auto-resize jQuery plugin.)For those that are coding for IE and encounter this problem. IE has a little trick that makes it 100% CSS.You can even provide a value for rows=\"n\" which IE will ignore, but other browsers will use. I really hate coding that implements IE hacks, but this one is very helpful. It is possible that it only works in Quirks mode.Internet Explorer, Safari, Chrome and Opera users need to remember to explicidly set the line-height value in CSS. I do a stylesheet that sets the initial properites for all text boxes as follows.Here is a function I just wrote in jQuery to do it - you can port it to Prototype, but they don't support the \"liveness\" of jQuery so elements added by Ajax requests will not respond.This version not only expands, but it also contracts when delete or backspace is pressed.This version relies on jQuery 1.4.2.Enjoy ;)http://pastebin.com/SUKeBtnxUsage:or (any jQuery selector for example)It was tested on Internet Explorer 7/Internet Explorer 8, Firefox 3.5, and Chrome.

The property takes two parameters where one defines the size of the dash and the other determines the space between them.Pros:Cons:We can use multiple linear-gradient background images and position them appropriately to create a dashed border effect. This can also be done with a repeating-linear-gradient but there is not much improvement because of using a repeating gradient as we need each gradient to repeat in only one direction.Pros:Cons:We can create a small bar (in the shape of the dash) using pseudo-elements and then create multiple box-shadow versions of it to create a border like in the below snippet. If the dash is a square shape then a single pseudo-element would be enough but if it is a rectangle, we would need one pseudo-element for the top + bottom borders and another for left + right borders. This is because the height and width for the dash on the top border will be different from that on the left.Pros:Cons:Short one: No, it's not. You will have to work with images instead.Stroke length depends on stroke width. You can increase length by increasing width and hide part of border by inner element.https://jsfiddle.net/ok6srt2z/This will make an orange and gray border using the class=\"myclass\" on the div.I just recently had the same problem. I managed to solve it with two absolutely positioned divs carrying the border (one for horizontal and one for vertical), and then transforming them.\nThe outer box just needs to be relatively positioned.Note: i used tachyons in this example, but i guess the classes are kind of self-explanatory."},

However, applying display: flex to the .inner caused issues so I explicitly set the .inner to display: block and set the .outer to flex for positioning.I set the minimum .outer height to fill the viewport, the display: flex, and set the horizontal and vertical alignment:I set .inner to display: block explicitly.

It works like a charm.If you can define the parent's width and height, there's a simpler way to centralize the image without having to create a container for it.For some reason, if you define the min-width, IE will recognize max-width as well.This solution works for IE10+, Firefox and Chrome.https://jsfiddle.net/HumbertoMendes/t13dzsmn/"},

This means it can align items along horizontal OR vertical lines. A flex item is confined to its row or column.A true grid system is two-dimensional, meaning it can align items along horizontal AND vertical lines. Content items can span across rows and columns simultaneously, which flex items cannot do.This is why flexbox has a limited capacity for building grids. It's also a reason why the W3C has developed another CSS3 technology, Grid Layout.In a flex container with flex-flow: row wrap, flex items must wrap to new rows.This means that a flex item cannot wrap under another item in the same row.Notice above how div #3 wraps below div #1, creating a new row. It cannot wrap beneath div #2.As a result, when items aren't the tallest in the row, white space remains, creating unsightly gaps.If you switch to flex-flow: column wrap, a grid-like layout is more attainable. However, a column-direction container has four potential problems right off the bat:As a result, a column-direction container is not an option in this case, and in many other cases.Grid Layout would be a perfect solution to your problem if the various heights of the content items could be pre-determined. All other requirements are well within Grid's capacity.The width and height of grid items must be known in order to close gaps with surrounding items.So Grid, which is the best CSS has to offer for building a horizontally-flowing masonry layout, falls short in this case.In fact, until a CSS technology arrives with the ability to automatically close the gaps, CSS in general has no solution. Something like this would probably require reflowing the document, so I'm not sure how useful or efficient it would be.You'll need a script.JavaScript solutions tend to use absolute positioning, which removes content items from the document flow in order to re-arrange them with no gaps. Here are two examples:For layouts where the width and height of content items are known, here's a horizontally-flowing masonry layout in pure CSS:How it worksBrowser Support for CSS GridHere's the complete picture: http://caniuse.com/#search=gridCool grid overlay feature in FirefoxIn Firefox dev tools, when you inspect the grid container, there is a tiny grid icon in the CSS declaration.

The same thing happens with :nth-of-type().Can someone explain why?This is a very common problem that arises due to a misunderstanding of how :nth-child() and :nth-of-type() work. Unfortunately, there is currently no selector-based solution as yet because Selectors does not provide a way to match the nth child that matches an arbitrary selector based on a pattern such as odd-numbered, even-numbered or any an+b where a != 1 and b != 0. This extends beyond just class selectors, to attribute selectors, negations, and more complex combinations of simple selectors.The :nth-child() pseudo-class counts elements among all of their siblings under the same parent. It does not count only the siblings that match the rest of the selector. Similarly, the :nth-of-type() pseudo-class counts siblings sharing the same element type, which refers to the tag name in HTML, and not the rest of the selector.This also means that if all the children of the same parent are of the same element type, for example in the case of a table body whose only children are tr elements or a list element whose only children are li elements, then :nth-child() and :nth-of-type() will behave identically, i.e. for every value of an+b, :nth-child(an+b) and :nth-of-type(an+b) will match the same set of elements.In fact, all simple selectors in a given compound selector, including pseudo-classes such as :nth-child() and :not(), work independently of one another, rather than looking at the subset of elements that are matched by the rest of the selector.This also implies that there is no notion of order among simple selectors within each individual compound selector1, which means for example the following two selectors are equivalent:Translated to English, they both mean:(you'll notice my use of an unordered list here, just to drive the point home)Because there is currently no pure CSS solution, you'll have to use a script to filter elements and apply styles or extra class names accordingly. For example, the following is a common workaround using jQuery (assuming there is only one row group populated with tr elements within the table):With the corresponding CSS:If you're using automated testing tools such as Selenium or processing HTML with tools like lxml, many of these tools allow XPath as an alternative:Other solutions using different technologies are left as an exercise to the reader; this is just a brief, contrived example for illustration.For what it's worth, there is a proposal for an extension to the :nth-child() notation to be added to Selectors level 4 for the specific purpose of selecting every nth child matching a given selector.2The selector by which to filter matches is provided as an argument to :nth-child(), again due to how selectors operate independently of one another in a sequence as dictated by the existing selector syntax. So in your case, it would look like this:(An astute reader will note right away that this ought to be :nth-child(odd of tr.row) instead, since the simple selectors tr and :nth-child() operate independently of one another as well. This is one of the problems with functional pseudo-classes that accept selectors, a can of worms I'd rather not open in the middle of this answer. Instead I'm going to go with the assumption that most sites will not have any other elements than tr elements as siblings of one another in a table body, which would make either option functionally equivalent.)Of course, being a brand new proposal in a brand new specification, this probably won't see implementation until a few years down the road. In the meantime, you'll have to stick with using a script, as above.1 If you specify a type or universal selector, it must come first. This does not change how selectors fundamentally work, however; it's nothing more than a syntactic quirk.2 This was originally proposed as :nth-match(), however because it still counts an element relative only to its siblings, and not to every other element that matches the given selector, it has since as of 2014 been repurposed as an extension to the existing :nth-child() instead.Not really..quote from the docsIt is a selector of its own and does not combine with classes. In your rule it just has to satisfy both selector at the same time, so it will show the :nth-child(even) table rows if they also happen to have the .row class.nth-of-type works according to the index of same type of the element but nth-child works only according to index no matter what type of siblings elements are.For exampleSuppose in above html we want to hide all the elements having rest class.In this case nth-child and nth-of-type will work exactly same as all the element are of same type that is <div> so css should beORNow you must be wondering what is the difference between nth-child and nth-of-type so this is the differenceSuppose the html is In the above html the type of .rest element is different from others .rest are paragraphs and others are div so in this case if you use nth-child you have to write like thisbut if you use nth-of-type css can be thisYou may be able to do that with xpath. something like //tr[contains(@class, 'row') and position() mod 2 = 0] might work. There are other SO questions expanding on the details how to match classes more precisely.Here is your answerAll of the questions around using nth-child and skipping hidden tags appear to be redirecting as dupes of this one so I will leave this here. I came across this blog https://blog.blackbam.at/2015/04/09/css-nth-child-selector-ignore-hidden-element/ that uses a clever css approach to make nth-child ignore hidden elements, as follows:The following CSS adds a margin right to every second visible element no matter which element has the cpw class.Hope that helps someone who is following the dupe trail for the ignore hidden elements questions!"},

I come to this problem and didn't find a clear answer on the web. Is there a difference between using @import or link in CSS?Use of @importUse of LinkWhat's the best way to do it? and why?\nThanks!In theory, the only difference between them is that @import is the CSS mechanism to include a style sheet and <link> the HTML mechanism. However, browsers handle them differently, giving <link> a clear advantage in terms of performance.Steve Souders wrote an extensive blog post comparing the impact of both <link> and @import (and all sorts of combinations of them) called \"don’t use @import\". That title pretty much speaks for itself.Yahoo! also mentions it as one of their performance best practices (co-authored by Steve Souders): Choose <link> over @importAlso, using the <link> tag allows you to define \"preferred\" and alternate stylesheets. You can't do that with @import.You can use the import command to import another CSS inside a css file which is not possible with the link command. Really old browser cannot (IE4, IE5 partially) handle the import functionality. Additionally some libraries parsing your xhtml/html could fail in getting the style sheet import. Please be aware that your import should come before all other CSS declarations.No real difference today, but @import is not handled correctly by older browsers (Netscape 4, etc.), so the @import hack can be used to hide CSS 2 rules from these old browsers.Again, unless you're supporting really old browsers, there isn't a difference.If I were you, however, I'd use the <link> variant on your HTML pages, because it allows you to specify things like media type (print, screen, etc.).The <link> directive can allow for multiple css be loaded and interpreted asyncronously.the @import directive forces the browser* to wait until the imported script is loaded inline to the parent script before it can be correctly processed by it's engine, since technically it is just one script.A lot of css minimization scripts (and languages like less or sass) will automatically concatenate linked scripts into the main script since it ends up causing less transfer overhead.* (depends on the browser)This article may be of use here: 4 methods of adding CSS to HTML: link, embed, inline and importWhen I use the @import rule, it's generally to import a stylesheet within an existing stylesheet (although I dislike doing it to begin with). But to answer your question, no I don't believe there's any difference. Just make sure to put the URL in double quotes in order to comply with valid XHTML.@import is generally meant to be used in an external stylesheet rather than inline like in your example. If you really wanted to hide a stylesheet from very old browsers you could use that as a hack to prevent them from using that stylesheet. Overall, the <link> tag is processed more quickly than the @import rule (which is apparently somewhat slow as far as the css processing engine is concerned).Microsoft Internet Explorer 9 (MSIE9) doesn't seem to handle @import properly.  Observe these entries from my Apache log (IP address hidden but whois said it was owned by Microsoft itself): the main HTML linked to screen.css which hadwhich I am now about to change to link elements in the HTML, because it seems MSIE9 issues two incorrect requests to the server, getting 404 errors I could do without:There were proper requests for these files afterwards, but we can do without this \"shoot at server first, parse url after\" logic."},

It's best to use : for before and after pseudo elements since the single colon has better browser support, namely in earlier IE versions.The :: operator indicates you are selecting a pseudo element, one which does not actually exist as an element but can still be targeted for styling.Example of this include several vendor-specific implementations such as the -ms-clear sample you provide, most browsers also have pseudo elements to style scroll bars and other native UI elements, but there are also a lot of predefined pseudo elements which can be referenced for practical reasons, such as first-line and first-letter.The :before and :after pseudo elements even allow you to insert actual content into the page using CSS with the content rule.CSS3 changes the way pseudo-elements are selected, as the W3C wanted to distinguish pseudo-classes like a:visited from pseudo-elements like p::first-line.

The gist of it is that it is not easy to style InfoWindows directly, and it might be easier to use the additional InfoBubble class instead of InfoWindow, or to override GOverlay. Another option would be to modify the elements of the InfoWindow using javascript (or jQuery), like later ATOzTOA suggested. Possibly the simplest of these examples is using InfoBubble instead of InfoWindow.

You can fix it with gimp eg.to simulate RGBA and HSLA background in IE, you can use a gradient filter, with the same start and end color ( alpha channel is the first pair in the value of HEX ) I believe this is the best because on this page has a tool to help you generate alpha-transparent background:\"Cross browser alpha transparent background CSS (rgba)\" (*now linked to archive.org)the transparent png image will not work in IE 6-, alternatives are:with CSS:or just do it with jQuery:Though late, I had to use that today and found a very useful php script here that will allow you to dynamically create a png file, much like the way rgba works.The script can be downloaded here: http://lea.verou.me/wp-content/uploads/2009/02/rgba.zipI know it may not be the perfect solution for everybody, but it's worth considering in some cases, since it saves a lot of time and works flawlessly. Hope that helps somebody!There are mostly all browser support RGBa code in CSS but only IE8 and below level does not support RGBa css code. For This here is solution. For The solution you must follow this code and it’s better to go with it’s sequence otherwise you will not get perfect output as you wish. This code is used by me and it’s mostly perfect. make comment if it’s perfect.You use css to change the opacity. To cope with IE you'd need something like:But the only problem with this is that it means anything inside the container will also be 0.3 opacity. Thus you'll have to change your HTML to have another container, not inside the transparent one, that holds your content.Otherwise the png technique, would work. Except you'd need a fix for IE6, which in itself could cause problems.I'm late to the party, but for anyone else who finds this - this article is very useful:\nhttp://kilianvalkhof.com/2010/css-xhtml/how-to-use-rgba-in-ie/It uses the gradient filter to display solid but transparent colour.To use rgba background in IE there is a fallback.We have to use filter property. that uses ARGBthis is fallback for  rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.2) Change #33ffffff according to yours.this worked for me to solve the problem in IE8:CheersThis solution really works, try it. Tested in IE8It is very simply you have to give first you have to give backgound as rgb because Internet Explorer 8 will support rgb instead rgba and then u have to give opacity like filter:alpha(opacity=50);This a transparency solution for most browsers including IE xThe best solution I found so far is the one proposed by David J Marland in his blog, to support opacity in old browsers (IE 6+):After searching a lot, I found the following solution which is working in my cases:*Important: To calculate ARGB(for IEs) from RGBA, we can use online tools:"},

The trick to this is specifying 100% height on the html and body elements.\nSome browsers look to the parent elements (html, body) to calculate the height. forget all the answers, this line of CSS worked for me in 2 seconds :1vh = 1% of browser screen heightsourceFor responsive layout scaling, you might want to use :[update november 2018]\nAs mentionned in the comments, using the min-height might avoid having issues on reponsive designs[update april 2018] As mentioned in the comments, back in 2011 when the question was asked, not all browsers supported the viewport units.\nThe other answers were the solutions back then -- vmax is still not supported in IE, so this might not be the best solution for all yet. Actually the best approach is this:This solves everything for me and it helps me to control my footer and it can have the fixed footer no matter if page is being scrolled down.Technical Solution - EDITEDHistorically, 'height' is tricky thing to mold with, compared to 'width', the easiest. Since css focus on <body> for styling to work. The code above - we gave <html> and <body> a height. This is where magic comes into picture - since we have 'min-height' on playing table, we are telling browser that <body> is superior over <html> because <body> holds the min-height. This in turn, allows <body> to override <html> because <html> had height already earlier. In other words, we are tricking browser to \"bump\" <html> off the table, so we could style independently.The accepted solution will not actually work. \nYou will notice that the content div will be equal to the height of its parent, body. \nSo setting the body height to 100% will set it equal to the height of the browser window. Let's say the browser window was 768px in height, by setting the content div height to 100%, the div's height will in turn be 768px. Thus, you will end up with the header div being 150px and the content div being 768px. In the end you will have content 150px below the bottom of the page. For another solution, check out this link.You can use vh on the min-height property.You can do as follows, depending on how you are using the margins...With HTML5 you can do this:CSS:HTML:For me, the next worked well:I wrapped the header and the content on a divI used this reference to fill the height with flexbox. The CSS goes like this:For more info about the flexbox technique, visit the referenceYou can also set the parent to display: inline. See http://codepen.io/tommymarshall/pen/cECyHBe sure to also have the height of html and body set to 100%, too.The accepted answer does not work. And the highest voted answer does not answer the actual question. With a fixed pixel height header, and a filler in the remaining display of the browser, and scroll for owerflow. Here is a solution that actually works, using absolute positioning. I also assume that the height of the header is known, by the sound of \"fixed header\" in the question. I use 150px as an example here:HTML:CSS:(adding background-color for visual effect only)For a more detailed look how this works, with actual content inside the #Content, have a look at this jsfiddle, using bootstrap rows and columns. In this instance I want my main content div to be liquid height so that the whole page takes up 100% of the browser height.height: 100vh;Please let me add my 5 cents here and offer a classical solution:This will work in all browsers, no script, no flex. Open snippet in full page mode and resize browser: desired proportions are preserved even in fullscreen mode.To complete my answer, here is the footer layout:And here is the layout with both header and footer:Unless you need to support IE 9 and below, I would use flexboxYou also need to get body to fill the whole pageCSS PLaY | cross browser fixed header/footer/centered single column layoutCSS Frames, version 2: Example 2, specified width | 456 Berea StreetOne important thing is that although this sounds easy, there's going to be quite a bit of ugly code going into your CSS file to get an effect like this.

Can you explain the advantage?There's a really good article on web typography on A List Apart.Their conclusion:From http://archivist.incutio.com/viewlist/css-discuss/1408Both adjust the font-size relative to what it was. 1.5em is the same as 150%. The only advantage seems to be readability, choose whichever you are most comfortable with.Given that (nearly?) all browsers now resize the page as a whole, rather than just the text, previous issues with px vs. % vs. ems in terms of accessible font resizing are rather moot. So, the answer is that it probably doesn't matter. Use whatever works for you.The real difference comes apparent when you use it not for font-sizes. Setting a padding of 1em is not the same as 100%. em is always relative to the font-size. But % might be relative to font-size, width, height and probably some other things I don't know about.Regarding the difference between the css units % and em.As far as I understand (at least theoretically/conceptually, but possibly not how these two units might be implemented in browsers) these two units are equivalent, i.e. if you multiply your em value with 100 and then replace em with % it should be the same thing ?If there actually is some real difference between em and % then can someone explain it (or provide a link to an explanation) ?(I wanted to add this comment of mine where it would belong, i.e. indented just below the answer by \"Liam, answered Sep 25 '08 at 11:21\" since I also want to know why his answer was downvoted, but I could not figure out how to put my comment there and therefore had to write this \"thread global\" reply)As Galwegian mentions, px is the most reliable for web typography, as everything else you do on the page is mostly laid out in reference to a computer monitor. The problem with absolute sizes is that some browsers (IE) won't scale pixel-value elements on a web-page, so when you try to zoom in/out, everything adjusts except for those elements.I do not know whether IE8 handles this properly, but all other browser vendors handle pixels just fine and it is still a minority case where a user needs to enlarge/diminish text (this text box on SO perhaps being the exception). If you want to get really dirty, you could always add a javascript function for making your text size larger and offer a \"small\"/\"larger\" button to the user.Yahoo User Interface library (http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/) has a nice set of base css classes used to \"reset\" the browser specific settings so that the basis for displaying the site is same for all (supported) browsers.With YUI one is supposed to use percentages."},

Define your viewBox to be 100 units in width, then define your rect to be 10 units.  After that, however large you scale the SVG, the rect will be 10% the width of the image.Suppose I have an SVG which looks like this:\n And I want to put it in a div and make it fill the div responsively. My way of doing it is as follows:First I open the SVG file in an application like inkscape. In File->Document Properties I set the width of the document to 800px and and the height to 600px (you can choose other sizes). Then I fit the SVG into this document.Then I save this file as a new SVG file and get the path data from this file.\nNow in HTML the code that does the magic is as follows:Note that width and height of SVG are both set to 100%, since we want it to fill the container vertically and horizontally ,but width and height of the viewBox are the same as the width and height of the document in inkscape which is 800px X 600px. The next thing you need to do is set the preserveAspectRatio to \"none\". If you need to have more information on this attribute here's a good link. And that's all there is to it.One more thing is that this code works on almost all the major browsers even the old ones but on some versions of android and ios you need to use some javascrip/jQuery code to keep it consistent. I use the following in document ready and resize functions:Hope it helps!What's worked for me recently is to remove all height=\"\" and width=\"\" attributes from the <svg> tag and all child tags. Then you can use scaling using a percentage of the parent container's height or width.@robertc has it right, but you also need to notice that svg, #container causes the svg to be scaled exponentially for anything but 100% (once for #container and once for svg).In other words, if I applied 50% h/w to both elements, it's actually 50% of 50%, or .5 * .5, which equals .25, or 25% scale.One selector works fine when used as @robertc suggests.For your iphone You could use in your head balise :"},

There are a couple of implementations in progress that I've seen, but none that I can recommend using at this time.However, please a few points:So while it's a little more setup to get started, we (the sass core team) think that server side compilation is the best long term approach. Similarly, the less developers prefer server side compilation for production stylesheets.Since visionmeda/sass.js isn't available anymore and scss-js hasn't been updated in 2 years, I might interest you in sass.js. It's the C++ library libsass (also used by node-sass) compiled to JavaScript using Emscripten. An implementation to compile scss stylesheets linked or inlined in html can be found at sass.link.js.Try out sass.js using the interactive playgroundYESAs we were expecting, after rewriting it on C++, it is possible to compile it in Javascript via Emscripten.This is browser version: https://github.com/medialize/sass.js/As they recommend, for node you can use this one: https://github.com/sass/node-sassI just discovered an interesting Sass.js Playground. A few things may have changed over the years. Check this out:http://medialize.github.io/playground.sass.js/You definitely shouldn't make all of your users compile stylesheets, however a javascript implementation can run on the server as well. I'm also looking for a javascript sass implementation - to use in a node.js app. Is this something the sass team is considering?There is an attempt on GitHub, scss-js. However, it is incomplete and hasn't had any commits in five months.While there is no officially sanctioned JavaScript implementation of sass, there is an official C/C++ port of the Sass engine, known as LibSass. Because LibSass is an official implementation, it's best to opt for a JavaScript library that uses LibSass under the hood.For JavaScript running in a Node.js environment, there's Node-sass.Under the hood, Node-sass uses LibSass itself.For JavaScript running in the browser, there's Sass.js.Under the hood, Sass.js uses a version of LibSass (v3.3.6 at the point of my writing this) that's been converted to JavaScript with Emscripten."},

This is a new feature in CSS Selectors Level 4.Presently it is available in Chrome 49+, Firefox 47+, Safari 9+, and Opera 37+*. Prior to this it was only available in the Chrome user-agent styles starting around Chrome 39, but could be enabled for web content by setting the experimental features flag.* Earlier versions of Opera may also support it.The above square will be green if the browser supports this feature, red if it does not.That is the case-insensitive flag for attribute selectors, introduced in Selectors 4. Apparently they snuck an implementation of this feature into Chrome as early as August 2014.In a nutshell: this flag tells the browser to match the respective values for the type attribute case-insensitively. The default selector matching behavior for attribute values in HTML is case-sensitive, which is often undesirable because many attributes are defined to have case-insensitive values, and you want to make sure your selector picks up all the right elements regardless of case. type is one example of such an attribute, because it is an enumerated attribute, and enumerated attributes are said to have case-insensitive values.Here are the relevant commits:Note that it's currently hidden within the \"Enable experimental Web Platform features\" flag, which you can access at chrome://flags/#enable-experimental-web-platform-features. This might explain why the feature went largely unnoticed — features hidden behind that flag can only be used internally and not in public-facing code (such as author stylesheets) unless it is enabled, because they are experimental and therefore not ready for production use.Here's a test case that you can use — compare the results when the flag is enabled and disabled:Note that I use a custom data attribute instead of type to show that it can be used with just about any attribute.I am not aware of any other implementations as of this writing, but hopefully other browsers will catch up soon. This is a relatively simple but extremely useful addition to the standard and I look forward to being able to use it in future."},

This changes the alignment in a non-standard, unexpected way. More details: Absolutely positioned flex item is not removed from the normal flow in IE11With a combination of auto margins and a new, invisible flex item the layout can be achieved.The new flex item is identical to item D and is placed at the opposite end (the left edge).More specifically, because flex alignment is based on the distribution of free space, the new item is a necessary counterbalance to keep the three middle boxes horizontally centered. The new item must be the same width as the existing D item, or the middle boxes won't be precisely centered.The new item is removed from view with visibility: hidden.In short:This method is similar to #2, except it's cleaner semantically and the width of D must be known.Starting with Method #2 or #3 above, instead of worrying about equal width for the left and right items to maintain equal balance, just give each one flex: 1. This will force them both to consume available space, thus centering the middle item.You can then add display: flex to individual items in order to align their content.NOTE about using this method with min-height: Currently in Chrome, Firefox, Edge and possibly other browsers, the shorthand rule flex: 1 breaks down to this:That percentage unit (%) on flex-basis causes this method to break when min-height is used on the container. This is because, as a general rule, percentage heights on the children require an explicit height property setting on the parent.This is an old CSS rule dating back to 1998 (CSS Level 2) which is still in effect in many browsers to some degree or another. For complete details see here and here.Here's an illustration of the problem posted in the comments by user2651804:The solution is to not use the percentage unit. Try px or just nothing at all (which is what the spec actually recommends, despite the fact that at least some of the major browsers have appended a percentage unit for whatever reason).This may be the cleanest and most efficient method. There is no need for absolute positioning, fake elements or other hackery.Simply create a grid with multiple columns. Then position your items in the middle and end columns. Basically, just leave the first column empty.If you want to make it aligned, you can simply attach an empty span and split the three child spans into them.Most easy wayVery clear question. I couldn't help but post the answer after a few hours of digging.

That's fine, but can we also have it stretch or shrink the height to maintain the image proportions?HTMLCSSFor img tags if you define one side then other side is resized to keep aspect ratio and by default images expand to their original size.Using this fact if you wrap each img tag into div tag and set its width to 100% of parent div then height will be according to aspect ratio as you wanted.http://jsfiddle.net/0o5tpbxg/To keep images from stretching in either axis inside a flex parent I have found a couple of solutions. You can try using object-fit on the image which, e.g.http://jsfiddle.net/ykw3sfjd/Or you can add flex-specfic rules which may work better in some cases.No need to add a containing div.The default for the css \"align-items\" property is \"stretch\" which is what is causing your images to be stretched to its full original height.  Setting the css \"align-items\" property to \"flex-start\" fixes your issue.But that doesn't work as expected if the images that are being set as direct flex items with the current Flexible Box Layout Module Level 1, as far as I know.See these discussions and bug reports might be related:As a workaround, you could wrap each <img> with a <div> or a <span>, or so.jsFiddleAlternatively, you can use CSS table layout instead, which you'll get similar results as flexbox, it will work on more browsers, even for IE8.jsFiddleI have been playing around flexbox lately and i came to solution for this through experimentation and the following reasoning. However, in reality I'm not sure if this is exactly what happens.If real width is affected by flex system. So after width of elements hit max width of parent they extra width set in css is ignored. Then it's safe to set width to 100%.Since height of img tag is derived from image itself then setting height to 0% could do something. (this is where i am unclear as to what...but it made sense to me that it should fix it)(remember saw it here first!)Works only in chrome yetThis behavior is expected. flex container will stretch all its children by default. Image have no exception. (ie, parent will have align-items: stretch property )To keep the aspect ratio we've two solutions:orActually I found out that the container of the image tag need to have a height in order to keep the ratio of the image.\n for example>then in your html your container will wrap the tag imagethis work for IE and other browsersI just had the same issue. Use the flex align to center your elements. You need to use align-items: center instead of align-content: center. This will maintain the aspect ratio, while align-content will not keep the aspect ratio."},

These values are the radii on the X/Y axis of a quarter ellipse defining the shape of the corner.\nIf only one of the values is set then the second value is equal to the first one. So border-radius: x is equivalent to border-radius:x/x;.  Refering to the W3C specs : CSS Backgrounds and Borders Module Level 3 border-radius property this is what we can read concerning percentage values:So border-radius:50%; defines the raddi of the ellipse this way :Using one value other than a percentage for border radius (em, in, viewport related units, cm...) will always result in an ellipse with the same X/Y radii. In other words, a circle.When you set border-radius:999px; the radii of the circle should be 999px. But another rule is applied when the curves overlap reducing the radii of the circle to half the size of the smallest side. So in your example it is equal to half the height of the element : 50px. For this example (with a fixed size element) you can obtain the same result with both px and percentages. As the element is 230px x 100px, border-radius: 50%; is equivalent to border-radius:115px/50px; (50% of both sides) :Just divide the first value by the % you want.. so if you want a border-radius of 50%, write:or another example:You can easily do the math in js or SASS.Not an actual answer to the question but a usability advice for anyone that might stumble upon it:  If you want to use a relative unit but don't want the elliptical behaviour of % you can always use em or rem.

Let's face it, it's the hand we've been dealt. BUT, this does not mean you have an excuse to be lazy in your development, by ignoring current standards in favor of deprecated ones.Out goal should be to maintain compliance with current standards, while supporting as much of the legacy standard as possible.If pseudo-elements use : in CSS2 and :: in CSS3, we should not be using one or the other; we should be using both.To fully answer the original question asked, the following is the most appropriate method of supporting the most current implementation of CSS (version 3), while retaining legacy support for version 2.However, it's become increasingly popular to use polyfills for both new javascript and CSS, so you might just want to stick with using the newer double-colon (::) syntax, and maintain a polyfill for older browsers, so long as that is necessary.For what it's worth according to Browser Stats IE 8.0 has dropped to less than 1% in the USA over the past year.http://gs.statcounter.com/browser-version-partially-combined-market-share/desktop/united-states-of-america/#monthly-201512-201612In December 2015 IE 8.0 had 2.92% of the market.\nIn December 2016 IE 8.0 had .77% of the market.At that rate of decline it wouldn't be the worst idea to stop supporting old versions of IE and start using :: for Pseudo Elements.Including both notations is certainly safer, but I can't see any browser dropping the single notation for a long time, so only a single one'll be fine (it's valid CSS2.)Personnaly I only use the single colon notation, mostly by habit."},

This is matched by :first-child:The difference between :first-child and :first-of-type is that :first-of-type will match the first element of its element type, which in HTML is represented by its tag name, even if that element is not the first child of the parent. So far the child elements we're looking at have all been divs, but bear with me, I'll get to that in a bit.For now, the converse also holds true: any :first-child is also :first-of-type by necessity. Since the first child here is also the first div, it will match both pseudo-classes, as well as the type selector div:Now, if you change the type of the first child from div to something else, like h1, it will still be the first child, but it will no longer be the first div obviously; instead, it becomes the first (and only) h1. If there are any other div elements following this first child within the same parent, the first of those div elements will then match div:first-of-type. In the given example, the second child becomes the first div after the first child is changed to an h1:Note that :first-child is equivalent to :nth-child(1).This also implies that while any element may only have a single child element matching :first-child at a time, it can and will have as many children matching the :first-of-type pseudo-class as the number of types of children it has. In our example, the selector .parent > :first-of-type (with an implicit * qualifying the :first-of-type pseudo) will match two elements, not just one:The same holds true for :last-child and :last-of-type: any :last-child is by necessity also :last-of-type, since absolutely no other element follows it within its parent. Yet, because the last div is also the last child, the h1 cannot be the last child, despite being the last of its type.:nth-child() and :nth-of-type() function very similarly in principle when used with an arbitrary integer argument (as in the :nth-child(1) example mentioned above), but where they differ is in the potential number of elements matched by :nth-of-type(). This is covered in detail in What is the difference between p:nth-child(2) and p:nth-of-type(2)?I have created an example to demonstrate the difference between first-child and first-of-type here.HTMLCSSTo see the complete example, please visit https://jsfiddle.net/bwLvyf3k/1/"},

Consider this:and in your CSS file:That's the CSS way to do it.Then there are CSS preprocessors like Sass. You can use conditionals there, which'd look like this:Disadvantages are, that you're bound to pre-process your stylesheets, and that the condition is evaluated at compile time, not run time.A newer feature of CSS proper are custom properties (a.k.a. CSS variables). They are evaluated at run time (in browsers supporting them).With them you could do something along the line:Finally, you can preprocess your stylesheet with your favourite server-side language. If you're using PHP, serve a style.css.php file, that looks something like this:In this case, you will however have a performance impact, since caching such a stylesheet will be difficult.Below is my old answer which is still valid but I have a more opinionated approach today:One of the reasons why CSS sucks so much is exactly that it doesn't have conditional syntax. CSS is per se completely unusable in the modern web stack. Use SASS for just a little while and you'll know why I say that. SASS has conditional syntax... and a LOT of other advantages over primitive CSS too.Old answer (still valid):It cannot be done in CSS in general!You have the browser conditionals like:But nobody keeps you from using Javascript to alter the DOM or assigning classes dynamically or even concatenating styles in your respective programming language.I sometimes send css classes as strings to the view and echo them into the code like that (php):You could create two separate stylesheets and include one of them based on the comparison resultIn one of the you can putIn the other oneI think that the only check you can perform in CSS is browser recognition:Conditional-CSSYou can use calc() in combination with var() to sort of mimic conditionals:conceptSet the server up to parse css files as PHP and  then define the variable variable with a simple PHP statement.Of course this assumes you are using PHP...You can use not instead of if like As far as i know, there is no if/then/else in css. Alternatively, you can use javascript function to alter the background-position property of an element.Yet another option (based on whether you want that if statement to be dynamically evaluated or not) is to use the C preprocessor, as described here.(Yes, old thread. But it turned up on top of a Google-search so others might be interested as well)I guess the if/else-logic could be done with javascript, which in turn can dynamically load/unload stylesheets. I haven't tested this across browsers etc. but it should work. This will get you started:http://www.javascriptkit.com/javatutors/loadjavascriptcss.shtmlThis is a little extra info to the Boldewyn answer above.Add some php code to do the if/elseYou can add container div for all your condition scope.Add the condition value as a class to the container div. (you can set it by server side programming - php/asp...)Now you can use the container class as global variable for all elements in the div using nested selector, without adding the class to each element.CSS is a nicely designed paradigm, and many of it's features are not much used.If by a condition and variable you mean a mechanism to distribute a change of some value to the whole document, or under a scope of some element, then this is how to do it:This way, you distribute the impact of the variable throughout the CSS styles.\nThis is similar to what @amichai and @SeReGa propose, but more versatile.Another such trick is to distribute the ID of some active item throughout the document, e.g. again when highlighting a menu:  (Freemarker syntax used)Sure,this is only practical with a limited set of items, like categories or states, and not unlimited sets like e-shop goods, otherwise the generated CSS would be too big. But it is especially convenient when generating static offline documents.One more trick to do \"conditions\" with CSS in combination with the generating platform is this:I am surprised that nobody has mentioned CSS pseudo-classes, which are also a sort-of conditionals in CSS. You can do some pretty advanced things with this, without a single line of JavaScript.Some pseudo-classes:Example:If you're open to using jquery, you can set conditional statements using javascript within the html:This will change the text color of .class to green if the value of Variable is greater than 0.You can use javascript for this purpose, this way:You can use php if you write css in the  Tag"},

The common ones are ease-in, ease-out, ease-in-out, ease, and linear, or you can specify your own using cubic-bezier().Basically, easing out is to slow to a halt, easing in is to slowly accelerate, and linear is to do neither. You can find more detailed resources at the documentation for timing-function on MDN.And if you do want the aforementioned precise effects, the amazing Lea Verou’s cubic-bezier.com is there for you! It’s also useful for comparing the different timing functions graphically.Another, the steps() timing function, acts like linear, but only performs a finite number of steps between the transition’s beginning and its end. steps() has been most useful to me in CSS3 animations, rather than in transitions; a good example is in loading indicators with dots. Traditionally, one uses a series of static images (say eight dots, two changing colour each frame) to produce the illusion of motion. With a steps(8) animation and a rotate transform, you’re using motion to produce the illusion of separate frames! How fun."},

If I were to swap the ordering of the class names in the class attribute, nothing would change.The order of classes in the attribute is irrelevant.  All the classes in the class attribute are applied equally to the element.The question is: in what order do the style rules appear in your .css file.  In your example, .basic comes after .extra so the .basic rules will take precedence wherever possible.If you want to provide a third possibility (e.g., that it's .basic but that the .extra rules should still apply), you'll need to invent another class, .basic-extra perhaps, which explicitly provides for that.This can be done, but you have to get a little creative with your selectors.

As Dave Kiss points out, we can stop fancy box from doing this by adding the following parameters:But, now we can scroll the main page while looking at our fancy box window. It is better than jumping to the top of the page, but it is probably not what we really want. We can prevent scrolling the right way by adding the next parameters:And add these functions from galambalaz. See: How to disable scrolling temporarily?The problem is that fancyBox changes the overflow value of the body in order to hide the browser scrollbars.  I couldn't find an option to toggle this behavior.You could remove this section of the fancyBox code to prevent it:Despite the fact, that the proper way of solving this problem is via the options, which fancybox provides (refer to this answer), CSS could be used to solve the problem. There is no need to edit the library's css file, just add this to the main stylesheet of the application:The code resets the original overflow of the element. The problem is that overflow: hidden; hides the scrollbar on the <html> element, which causes the page to \"jump\" to the top. In order to preserve the position of the scrollbar, we overwrite the overflow with overflow: visible;This also helpedThe accepted answer is not complete as it does not actually solve the problem it just avoids it!

You could use :hover on all the other elements except the item in question to achieve this effect. But Im not sure how practical that would be. I think you have to look at a JS / jQuery solution. You can use CSS3 transition Some good links:http://css-tricks.com/different-transitions-for-hover-on-hover-off/http://www.alistapart.com/articles/understanding-css3-transitions/Just add a transition to the element you are messing with. Be aware that there could be some effects when the page loads. Like if you made a border radius change, you will see it when the dom loads.You have misunderstood :hover; it says the mouse is over an item, rather than the mouse has just entered the item.You could add animation to the selector without :hover to achieve the effect you want.Transitions is a better option: http://jsfiddle.net/Cvx96/The opposite of :hover appears to be :link. (edit: not technically an opposite because there are 4 selectors :link, :visited, :hover and :active. Five if you include :focus.)For example when defining a rule .button:hover{ text-decoration:none } to remove the underline on a button, the underline shows up when you roll off the button in some browsers. I've fixed this with .button:hover, .button:link{ text-decoration:none }This of course only works for elements that are actually links (have href attribute)Although answers here are sufficient, I really think W3Schools example on this issue is very straightforward (it cleared up the confusion (for me) right away).In summary, for transitions where you want the \"enter\" and \"exit\" animations to be the same, you need to employ transitions on the main selector .button rather than the hover selector .button:hover. For transitions where you want the \"enter\" and \"exit\" animations to be different, you will need specify  different main selector and hover selector transitions. Put your duration time in the non-hover selection:Just add a transition and the name of the animation on the class inicial, in your case, ul li a, just add a \"transition\" property and that is all you need "},

IE7+ supports attribute selectors:Element input with attribute type which contains a value that is equal to, begins with, contains or ends with a certain value.Other safe (IE7+) selectors are:Which for <p><span/><span/></p> would effectively give you:Further reading:\nBrowser CSS compatibility on quirksmode.comI'm surprised that everyone else thinks it can't be done. CSS attribute selectors have been here for some time already. I guess it's time we clean up our .css files.Sadly the other posters are correct that you're \n...actually as corrected by kRON, you are ok with your IE7 and a strict doc, but most of us with IE6 requirements are reduced to JS or class references for this, but it is a CSS2 property, just one without sufficient support from IE^h^h browsers.Out of completeness, the type selector is - similar to xpath - of the form [attribute=value] but many interesting variants exist. It will be quite powerful when it's available, good thing to keep in your head for IE8.You can do this with jQuery. Using their selectors, you can select by attributes, such as type. This does, however, require that your users have Javascript turned on, and an additional file to download, but if it works...Sorry, the short answer is no.  CSS (2.1) will only mark up the elements of a DOM, not their attributes.  You'd have to apply a specific class to each input.Bummer I know, because that would be incredibly useful.I know you've said you'd prefer CSS over JavaScript, but you should still consider using jQuery.  It provides a very clean and elegant way of adding styles to DOM elements based on attributes."},

If you need to support IE 9 or older, use the following solution:2.You can use the text-align: justify technique here.The working example can be seen here: http://jsfiddle.net/skip405/NfeVh/4/. This code works from IE7 and aboveIf inline-block elements in HTML are not separated with space, this solution won't work - see example http://jsfiddle.net/NfeVh/1408/ .

The working example using your markup is here - http://jsfiddle.net/skip405/NfeVh/5/. I just added the header:after part and justified the content.In order to solve the issue of the extra space that is inserted with the after pseudo-element one can do a trick of setting the font-size to 0 for the parent element and resetting it back to say 14px for the child elements. The working example of this trick can be seen here: http://jsfiddle.net/skip405/NfeVh/326/Taking advantage of @skip405's answer, I've made a Sass mixin for it:It accepts 3 parameters. The container, the left and the right element. \nFor example, to fit the question, you could use it like this:If you don't want to use floats, you're going to have to wrap your nav:...and add some more specific css:You may need to do a little more, but that's a start.If you're already using JavaScript to center stuff when the screen is too small (as per your comment for your header), why not just undo floats/margins with JavaScript while you're at it and use floats and margins normally.You could even use CSS media queries to reduce the amount JavaScript you're using.I think one possible solution to this is to use display: table:JSFiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/yxxrnn7j/1/New ways to align items right:Grid:DemoBootstrap 4.

As attribute selectors don't support regular expressions, you can only perform exact substring matches of the attribute value. For instance, if you have a space somewhere in the attribute value, like this:It won't match until you change your selector to accommodate the space. And then it will stop matching values that don't contain the space, unless you include all the permutations, ad nauseum.

Seems like hiding the overflow-x was the answer for me. I assume that stating the width at 100% helps in the event that my content goes wide. It should be noted that I was only having this issue in iOS. If it is also in Firefox, just the html and body block should probably be used as the @media is specifically targeting mobile devices.Please hip me if this seems incorrect to anyone :)This is a pretty old question, but I thought I'd add my 2 cents.  I've tried the above solutions, including the ghost css, which I will definitely be saving for future use.  But none of these worked in my situation.  Here's how I fixed my issue.  Hopefully this will help someone else. Open inspector (or whatever your preference) and starting with the first div in body tag,  add display: none; to just that element.  If the scroll bar disappears, you know that element contains the element that's causing the issue.  Then, remove the first css rule and go down one level into the containing element.  Add the css to that div, and if the scroll bar goes away, you know that element is either causing, or containing the offending element.  If adding the CSS does nothing, you know it was not that div that caused the issue, and either another div in the container  is causing it, or the container itself is causing it.  This may be too time consuming for some.  Lucky for me, my issue was in the header, but I can imagine this taking a bit of time if your issue was say, in the footer or something.  overflow-x: hidden; works perfect for me.The problem is in the file : style.css - line 721remove the lines :This basically gives a shadow gradient only to the footer. In Firefox, it is the first line that is causing the problem.I've also had the same issue ( Website body background rendering a right white margin in iPhone Safari ) and found that adding the background image to the <html> tag fixed the problem.BeforeAfterApparently the (-o-min-device-pixel-ratio: 3/2) is causing problems.  On my test site it was causing the right side to be cut off.  I found a workaround on github that works for now. Using(-o-min-device-pixel-ratio: ~\"3/2\") seems to work fine. I see the question has been answered to a general standard, but when I looked at your site I noticed there is still a horizontal scroll-bar. I also notice the reason for this:\nYou have used the code:which is being used alongside code stating that the element has a width of 100%, causing an element with a total width of 112% of screen size. To fix this, either remove the padding, replace the padding with a margin of 12% for the same effect, or change the width (or max-width) of the element to 88%. This occurs in main.css at line 343. Hope this helps!I had the same issue, so tried a few things. One of which seemed to work for me - removing the width and adding a float to the body tag.May not work for all instances, but in the scenario I recently had, hiding overflow on content elements was a no go...I was experiencing the white line to the right on my iPad as well in horizontal position only. I was using a fixed-position div with a background set to 960px wide and z-index of -999. This particular div only shows up on an iPad due to a media query. Content was then placed into a 960px wide div wrapper.\nThe answers provided on this page were not helping in my case.\nTo fix the white stripe issue I changed the width of the content wrapper to 958px. Voilá. No more white right white stripe on the iPad in horizontal position.This question has been hanging around for a while, but none of the fixes I could find worked for me (having the same issue with ipad), but I managed my own solution which should work for most people I imagine.Here's my code:Enjoy!"},

Mark your calendars and get ready to remove all those hacks you've put in place.OLDI have another answer:  wait.The FF dev team is in hot pursuit to resolve this issue.They have tentative fix set for Firefox 6.Easy there, imaginary, over-reactive person.  Firefox is on the fast dev track.  FF6 is set for release six weeks after Firefox 5.  Firefox 5 is set for release June 21st, 2011.So that puts the fix sometime in the beginning of August 2011...hopefully.You can sign up for the mailing list following the bug from the link in the original poster's question.Or you can click here; whichever is easiest.I must say I'm a little disappointed that the only browser specific hack in my application is going to be to support FF4. The above javascript solution doesn't account for variable width fonts. Here is a more verbose script that accounts for this. The big problem with this solution is that if the element containing the text is hidden when the code is run then the width of the box isn't known. This was a deal breaker for me so I stopped working on/testing it... but I thought I'd post it here in case it is of use to someone. Be sure to test it well as my testing was less than exhaustive. I intended to add a browser check to only run the code for FF4 and let all the other browsers use their existing solution.This should be available for fiddling here:\nhttp://jsfiddle.net/kn9Qg/130/HTML:CSS: Javascript (uses jQuery)It would be called like:I have run into this gremlin over the past week as well. Since the accepted solution does not account for variable width fonts and wwwhack's solution has a While Loop, I will throw in my $.02.I was able to drastically reduce the processing time of my problem by using cross-multiplication.  Basically, we have a formula that looks like this:The variable x in this case is what we need to solve.  When returned as an Integer, it will give the new length that the over-flowing text should be.  I multiplied the MaxLength by 80% to give the ellipses enough room to show.Here is a full html example:I understand this is a JS only fix, but until Mozilla fixes the bug, I'm just not smart enough to come up with a CSS solution.  This example works best for me because the JS is called every time a grid loads in our application.  The column-width for each grid vary and we have no control over what type of computer our Firefox users view our app (which, of course, we shouldn't have that control :) ).This pure CSS solution is really close, except for the fact that it causes ellipsis to appear after every line."},

That kind of positioning fixes the element in the viewport. I'd suggest simply fixing the element to one of the sides of the viewport (i.e. top, bottom, left or right) so that it doesn't interfere with other content.Now that mobile is over 70% from the internet market you can create something smart and responsive to do that.You can create this very easy with only css, use a overflow-x:scroll for a container and a overflow-y:scroll for another container. You can easily position the container elements with width:100vw and height:100vh.Middle click on the example to test it. Works best on mobile because you dont see the scroll bars.Starx's solution was extremely helpful to me. But I had some problems when I tried to implement a vertical scrolling sidebar with it. Here was my initial code, based on what Starx wrote:It's slightly different from Starx's solution, because I think his code is designed to allow a menu to float horizontally instead of vertically. But that's just an aside. The problem I had with the above code is that in a lot of browsers, or depending on the resource load of the computer, the menu movements would be choppy, whereas the initial css solution was nice and smooth. I attribute this to browsers being slower at firing javascript events than at implementing css.My alternate solution to this choppiness problem is set the frame to fixed instead of absolute, then cancel out the horizontal movements using starx's method. You might say all I'm doing is trading vertical scrolling choppiness for horizontal scrolling choppiness. But the thing is, 99% of scrolling is vertical, and it's much more annoying when that is choppy than when horizontal scrolling is.Here's my related post on this matter, if I haven't already exhausted everyone's patience: Fixing a menu in one direction in jqueryI stumbled on this post looking for a nice way to keep my header/navigation bar centered and responsive to size changes.As we scroll, the bar moves upwards off the screen.

How can I modify the style instead of the inline values, given an id?Ok, it sounds like you want to change the global CSS so which will effictively change all elements of a peticular style at once.  I've recently learned how to do this myself from a Shawn Olson tutorial.  You can directly reference his code here.Here is the summary:You can retrieve the stylesheets via document.styleSheets.  This will actually return an array of all the stylesheets in your page, but you can tell which one you are on via the document.styleSheets[styleIndex].href property.  Once you have found the stylesheet you want to edit, you need to get the array of rules.  This is called \"rules\" in IE and \"cssRules\" in most other browsers.  The way to tell what CSSRule you are on is by the selectorText property.  The working code looks something like this:Let me know how this works for ya, and please comment if you see any errors.Please! Just ask w3 (http://www.quirksmode.org/dom/w3c_css.html)!\nOr actually, it took me five hours... but here it is!The function is really easy to use.. example:Oh..\nGathering the code in the answers, I wrote this function that seems running well on my FF 25.This is a way to put values in the css that will be used in JS even if not understood by the browser. e.g. maxHeight for a tbody in a scrolled table.Call :CCSStylesheetRuleStyle('default', \"#mydiv\", \"height\");CCSStylesheetRuleStyle('default', \"#mydiv\", \"color\", \"#EEE\");I don't know why the other solutions go through the whole list of stylesheets for the document. Doing so creates a new entry in each stylesheet, which is inefficient. Instead, we can simply append a new stylesheet and simply add our desired CSS rules there.Note that we can override even inline styles set directly on elements by adding \" !important\" to the value of the property, unless there already exist more specific \"!important\" style declarations for that property.I don't have rep enough to comment so I'll format an answer, yet it is only a demonstration of the issue in question.It seems, when element styles are defined in stylesheets they are not visible to getElementById(\"someElement\").styleThis code illustrates the issue... Code from below on jsFiddle.In Test 2, on the first call, the items left value is undefined, and so, what should be a simple toggle gets messed up. For my use I will define my important style values inline, but it does seem to partially defeat the purpose of the stylesheet.Here's the page code...I hope this helps to illuminate the issue.SkipYou can get the \"computed\" styles of any element.IE uses something called \"currentStyle\", Firefox (and I assume other \"standard compliant\" browsers) uses \"defaultView.getComputedStyle\".You'll need to write a cross browser function to do this, or use a good Javascript framework like prototype or jQuery (search for \"getStyle\" in the prototype javascript file, and \"curCss\" in the jquery javascript file).That said if you need the height or width you should probably use element.offsetHeight and  element.offsetWidth.Mind, if you add an inline style to the element in question, it can act as the \"default\" value and will be readable by Javascript on page load, since it is the element's inline style property:This simple 32 lines gist lets you identify a given stylesheet and change its styles very easily:I've never seen any practical use of this, but you should probably consider DOM stylesheets. However, I honestly think that's overkill.If you simply want to get the width and height of an element, irrespective of where the dimensions are being applied from, just use element.offsetWidth and element.offsetHeight.Perhaps try this:"},

I thought the list was being explicitly generated.I will give here the kind of answer i usually don't like to read, but i think that as there are other answers telling you how to achive what you want, it could be nice to rethink if what you are trying to achive is really a good idea.First, you should think if it is a good idea to show the items in a non-standard way, with a separator charater diferent than the provided.I don't know the reasons for that, but let's suppose you have good reasons.The ways propossed here to achive that consist in add content to your markup, mainly trough the CSS :before pseudoclass. This content is really modifing your DOM structure, adding those items to it.When you use standard \"ol\" numeration, you will have a rendered content in which the \"li\" text is selectable, but the number preceding it is not selectable. That is, the standard numbering system seems to be more \"decoration\" than real content. If you add content for numbers using for example those \":before\" methods, this content will be selectable, and dued to this, performing undesired vopy/paste issues, or accesibility issues with screen readers that will read this \"new\" content in addition to the standard numeration system.Perhaps another approach could be to style the numbers using images, although this alternative will bring its own problems (numbers not shown when images are disabled, text size for number not changing, ...).Anyway, the reason for this answer is not just to propose this \"images\" alternative, but to make people think in the consequences of trying to change the standard numeration system for ordered lists.This code makes numbering style same as headers of li content.Modern browsers will interpret the value attribute and will display it as you expect. See MDN documentation.Also have a look at the <ol> article on MDN, especially the documentation for the start and attribute."},

E.g. \"border-collapse\"Just a guess, but it might affect how 'hidden' rows are being rendered.Can you include some code? I add style=\"display:none;\" to my table rows all the time and it effectively hides the entire row.You can set <tr id=\"result_tr\" style=\"display: none;\"> and then show it back with JavaScript:Thought I'd add to this a potential other solution:<tr style='visibility:collapse'><td>stuff</td></tr>I've only tested it on Chrome but putting this on the <tr> hides the row PLUS all the cells inside the row still contribute to the widths of the columns.  I will sometimes make an extra row at the bottom of a table with just some spacers that make it so certain columns can't be less than a certain width, then hide the row using this method.  (I know you're supposed to be able to do this with other css but I've never gotten that to work)Again, I'm in a purely chrome environment so I have no idea how this functions in other browsers.If display: none; doesn't work, how about setting height: 0; instead? In conjunction with a negative margin (equal to, or greater than, the height of the top and bottom borders, if any) to further remove the element? I don't imagine that position: absolute; top: 0; left: -4000px; would work, but it might be worth a try.For my part, using display: none works fine.Add some of the following line-height:0px;font-size:0px;height:0px;margin:0;padding:0;I forget which one does it.  I think it's line-height for IE6.I was having the same issue, I even added style=\"display: none\" to each cell.In the end I used HTML comments \n    <!-- [HTML] -->You can use style display:none with tr to hide and it will work with all browsers.This happened to me and I was baffled as to why.

The image will dynamically be centered and resized to fit the window.The [other, old] solution, using JQuery, sets the height of the image container (body in the example below) so that the max-height property on the image works as expected. The image will also automatically resize when the client window is resized.Note: User gutierrezalex packaged a very similar solution as a JQuery plugin on this page.Here is a simple CSS only solution (JSFiddle), works everywhere, mobile and IE included:CSS 2.0:HTML:CSS3 introduces new units that are measured relative to the viewport, which is the window in this case. These are vh and vw, which measure viewport height and width, respectively. Here is a simple CSS only solution:The one caveat to this is that it only works if there are no other elements contributing height on the page. If you are willing to put a container element around your image, a pure CSS solution is simple. You see, 99% height has no meaning when the parent element will extend vertically to contain its children. The parent needs to have a fixed height, say... the height of the viewport.HTMLCSSPlay with the fiddle.Resize Image to Fit the Screen by the Longest Side maintaining its Aspect RatioMy general lazy CSS rule:This may zoom in on your image if it is low-res to begin with (that's to do with your image quality and size in dimensions.\nTo center your image, you may also try (in the CSS)to center your imagein your HTML:I had a similar requirement, and had to do it it basic CSS and JavaScript.

And NONE was from the \"internal\" folder (Resources/assets). It was a pre-requisite to have the spare CSS PUBLIC and then build with assetic FROM there.These are the results:So... ONLY\n - The second image\n - Div B\n - Div C\nare the allowed syntaxes.Here there is the TWIG code:The container.css:And a.css, b.css, c.css, etc: all identical, just changing the color and the CSS selector.The \"directories\" structure is:Directories\nAll this came, because I did not want the individual original files exposed to the public, specially if I wanted to play with \"less\" filter or \"sass\" or similar... I did not want my \"originals\" published, only the compiled one.But there are good news. If you don't want to have the \"spare CSS\" in the public directories... install them not with --symlink, but really making a copy. Once \"assetic\" has built the compound CSS, and you can DELETE the original CSS from the filesystem, and leave the images:Compilation process\nNote I do this for the --env=prod environment.Just a few final thoughts:BUT ANYWAY, CAUTION NOW: As now the originals are not there anymore (rm -Rf), there are only two solutions, not three. The working div \"B\" does not work anymore as it was an asset() call assuming there was the original asset. Only \"C\" (the compiled one) will work.So... there is ONLY a FINAL WINNER: Div \"C\" allows EXACTLY what it was asked in the topic: To be compiled, respect the path to the images and do not expose the original source to the public.The winner is CThe cssrewrite filter is not compatible with the @bundle notation for now. So you have two choices:I'll post what worked for me, thanks to @xavi-montero.Put your CSS in your bundle's Resource/public/css directory, and your images in say Resource/public/img.Change assetic paths to the form 'bundles/mybundle/css/*.css', in your layout.In config.yml, add rule css_rewrite to assetic:Now install assets and compile with assetic:This is good enough for the development box, and --symlink is useful, so you don't have to reinstall your assets (for example, you add a new image) when you enter through app_dev.php.For the production server, I just removed the '--symlink' option (in my deployment script), and added this command at the end:All is done. With this, you can use paths like this in your .css files: ../img/picture.jpegI had the same problem and I just tried using the following as a workaround. Seems to work so far. You can even create a dummy template that just contains references to all those static assets.Notice the omission of any output which means nothing shows up on the template. When I run assetic:dump the files are copied over to the desired location and the css includes work as expected.If it can help someone, we have struggled a lot with Assetic, and we are now doing the following in development mode:I offen manage css/js plugin with composer which install it under vendor.\nI symlink those to the web/bundles directory, that's let composer update bundles as needed.exemple: 1 - symlink once at all (use command fromweb/bundles/2 - use asset where needed, in twig template : Regards."},

I have been looking around google and this site and can't find anything, any help would be appreciated. Thank youSass was originally written for Ruby, but now they've created libSass which is a C/C++ port of the Sass engine, which makes it easier to integrate the engine into an IDE or another language. At this point, you can use the Sass engine in Ruby, Node.js, Python, PHP, Java, .NET and others. For more information, visit libSass. Also, your IDE might have a plugin which would support Sass, without the need of ruby by using the libSass.The original answer below may or may not apply to your situation (depends on whether or not your language has implemented support for libSass or not). I decided to leave it the way it is for archive reasons.Sass (requires Ruby)Compass (requires Ruby, as it's based on SASS)Less (written in js, requires node.js or less.js included in the page)These are the main processors out there that I know of.\nYou may write your own parser/port for any another language of choice.In other words, no you can't use sass/compass without having Ruby because the program itself (sass & compass) IS written in Ruby. So you'll definitely need it in order to run it.It's true that the question is not clear enough, but i'll try to address some issues. There are other CSS pre-processors that don't rely on Ruby (two coming to my mind right now are Less, which i've used and liked, but not as powerful as Sass, and Stylus, which i haven't used, both based on JavaScript), but as you're specifically asking about Sass+Compass, and as i'm still looking for the same answer, i'll talk about that.@JamundFerguson said:Sass is a pre-processing language. There's a compiler built in Ruby for it and anyone can write a compiler in any language. There's a C implementation of a Sass compiler called libsass which can be used on any language that allows to import C libs. It's the library used by node-sass, which is a compiler built in Node.js, which I didn't tried yet and don't know how it could work and if it's ready for production use. It may be a question of time for Compass to be ported (maybe you end up doing that?) and so we can have a compiler which doesn't depends on the Ruby gem (currently, there's a node-compass module that does relies on the Ruby gem).So far i've mentioned the possibility for a Node.js compiler, which, as you may know, it's a JavaScript environment, being the language of the web and my language of choice. But you didn't specified which language you would like the compiler to be written into. I think there may be compilers built in many languages, for example, @EricMeyer mentioned a Python compiler. Maybe he's using pyScss? That seems to have built-in support for Compass. But then you need a Python environment. So the thing is: you'll need some environment for a compiler unless you run natively compiled binaries. (Less has less.js which can be included on the page to run client-side and avoid the compiling step, but it's not meant for using it on production.)I've worked for a year with CodeKit, which does very well, compiles Sass/Compass, Less, Stylus and template languages like Haml, Slim, Jade, etc. Rebuilds your assets when they change automatically and you see the changed on your browser immediately. The only thing that i didn't liked was that when moving to a different computer, installing CodeKit, checking out project and trying to use it, i had to reconfigure the project settings, which i had to remember so i could get to a build like the one i made in the other computer. Also i started working with a team, and they had also to configure the project with the same settings (sometimes not having the same project config lead to ugly inconsistencies) and also members of the team using Ubuntu couldn't use it. That's why i started to think on making a command-line tool to build projects and discovered Grunt immediately, and fell in love with it.\nAs @Dave mentioned, there's Scout and also there's LiveReload, but haven't used them.Conclusion is i have not a strong conclusion. I'm still looking for the same answer, but i hope this answer sheds a little bit of light on the status of compiling Sass/Compass outside of the Ruby environment.Actually there is a library that provides binding for Node.js to libsass, the C version of the Sass: https://npmjs.org/package/node-sassIt allows you to natively compile .scss files to css at incredible speed without Ruby installed.To install just run:And there is also a Grunt extension if needed: https://github.com/sindresorhus/grunt-sass (this is what I've been looking for in this question)Find out more at: https://github.com/andrew/node-sassJust a little bit of an update on this, you can use SCSS/SASS files and generate the correct files on the fly without installing Ruby by using a program called Scout.Scout has its own self contained ruby environment and is coded in java so make sure you java is up to date before using. Linky here.Regards :)You can actually parse sass without ruby, you can use node-sass.\ndetails here: https://github.com/andrew/node-sassIf this is for .NET, there is now a wrapper for libsass. Available from Nuget.Adobe Brackets (free, open source)  can compile LESS, SASS and Stylus when the files are changed, and update styles during live preview, you just need to install required extensions from the extension manager.\nGet Brackets and enjoy !Edit: As other questions suggest node-sass is also a good option if you have nodejs already installed."},

While in the Elements section, just click on the \"filename:linenumber\" link next to the CSS rules.  The CSS file that shows up will contain all of the modifications.This place exactly:In Chrome, you can right-click a CSS file in the Sources tab and click \"Local Modifications\"This shows you all of your local changes. Each revision is timestamped and you can rollback to  any previous revision.See the Live Editing and Revision History section of this tutorial.Firediff is a Firebug add-on that tracks changes done in Firebug. It logs everything you'll do in the HTML pane (great) but also your brief use of the Web Developer Toolbar extension (not so great), say Shift-Ctrl-F to obtain a font-size information in px.I have seen a Firebug extension in Chrome but didn't test it, I use Firediff with Firefox.I've suggested this product on SO before (I'm not affiliated with them in any way).http://www.skybound.ca/Excellent product. Sounds like exactly what you're looking for and much more.EDIT: Several other answers here have mentioned Google Chrome's ability to link to your local files (which is very very cool). Check out the other answers!I built a Chrome extension that does exactly this.It's called StyleURL - it takes whatever CSS changes you made in Chrome Inspector and outputs valid CSS as the diff: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/styleurl/emplcligcppnlalfjknjbanolhlnkmgpHere's an example where I added \"padding-bottom: 50px\" to this page:\nIt's open-source and on GitHub too: https://github.com/Jarred-Sumner/styleurl-extensionIf you edit external CSS, then you can drag its latest revision out of the Resources panel into any text editor that supports DnD (see http://www.webkit.org/blog/1463/web-inspector-styles-enhanced/, the \"Persisting Changes\" section for more detail.) You can also revert your CSS changes to any earlier version of the stylesheet resource (in the right-click popup menu of any stylesheet revision.)As mentioned by cloudworks, the answer to this has changed. This can now be accomplished rather well by the Chrome DevTools Autosave extension. This tool tracks CSS and JavaScript changes made within the Chrome Developer Tools console, and saves them back to local files. For instructions to install and setup the extension, please refer to the guide written by @addyosmani on his blog, here.There is also a handy screencast which details the extension rather well.With Workspaces you can have your CSS saved as you type them in your inspector (in Chrome). The problem is that every change is automatically saved and there's no way to disable this feature, as pointed in http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/developertools/revolutions2013/ and Disable automatic saving of CSS changes in Chrome Developer Tools. In Chrome there is also the Changes tab in the console drawer that displays all the modifications of CSS. It's not an export, but at least it is very convenient to quickly grasp what has changed. If you're using the Firefox stock dev tools you can edit the css directly in the tools dialog - click the CSS viewport button (that's the button at the top with the {} symbol) and edit your css directly. It will update in realtime in the browser and when you're done just copy-paste it directly into your css file. Nice!To add an answer for Safari specifically — it's kind of possible.When you edit CSS in the Styles section in the Inspector for an existing CSS file, you can hit Cmd-S to re-save the entire file with the changes.  However, if you're using a meta language like Sass / preprocessor / generating your CSS with bundling etc, I don't think this really solves that problem, though it may be possible with CSS source maps.When you edit CSS at the top of the Styles section, under Style Attribute to add inline styles (not tied to an existing CSS file), it doesn't seem possible to easily export all of those changes.  For now, I'm just copying and pasting the overrides manually for each element.The official Apple docs are a little dated but found here: Web Inspector Tutorial - Editing Code to Change Your Webpage.In Chrome, in the css inspector you can click and hold the + button, then choose to add your changes to the inspector-stylesheet.  It's not as convenient as directly editing in your css-selectors, but what you write will all be in inspector-stylesheet.cssMy in-beta-soon product LIVEditor does this exactly.To let you understand it easily, you can think of Firebug's inspector is embedded into your text editor.That way you don't have to make the changes manually again in your code editor after you tweaking it using Firebug or Webkit's developer tools."},

When loading the images with normal resolution they are upscaled via interpolation and therefore blurry. For me applying this rule in the media query to include those devices succeeded in  best customer feedback.If you are planing to use the same image for retina and non-retina screen then here is the solution. Say that you have a image of 200x200 and have two icons in top row and two icon in bottom row. So, it's four quadrants.Scaling and positioning of the sprite icons to 50% than actual value, you can get the expected result.Another handy SCSS mixin solution by Ryan Benhase.For more info about above mixin READ HERE.

Note that this seems pretty consistent across browsers. What determines whether an object can accept a :before and :after property?img and input are both replaced elements.:before and :after only work with non-replaced elements.From the spec:With span:before, span:after, the DOM looks like this:Evidently, that won't work with <img src=\"\" />.:before and :after are not required to work for replaced elements, and CSS specifications do not specify how they would work for them, and the concept of replaced element is somewhat vague.The CSS 2.1 specification clearly suggests that they can work for replaced elements, just saying that it does not “fully define” how. This relates to the issue that a replaced element is expected to have its own visual rendering, which is not controlled by CSS, whereas the pseudo-elements should add something to the content of the element. The spec adds that this will be defined “in more detail” in a future specification, but this has not taken place so far.Browser vendors just decided to avoid problems by not implementing these pseudo-elements for some elements at all.It is not clear at all what “replaced element” means, and the meaning appears to have changed somewhat. It is often interpreted as meaning the same as empty element (an element with EMPTY declared content, i.e. an element that cannot have any content), but CSS 2.1 itself shows a sample style sheet with the selector br:before (though browsers have ignored this, implementing br their own way). It can be argued that more and more elements have moved into the scope of CSS rendering, at least in part. For example, an input element (incuding its font, colors, etc.) is largely controllable with CSS in modern browsers.Current browsers (Firefox, IE, Chrome) do not seem to support the :after and :before pseudo-elements for empty elements other than hr. For hr, IE and Chrome place the generated content inside a bordered box, which is the implementation of hr; the content makes the box taller. Firefox places the content of both (!) pseudo-elements after the horizontal rule that is its implementation of hr. This variation illustrates the kinds of “interaction” problems that are referred to in CSS 2.1.It is often claimed that these pseudo-elements cannot be used for empty elements since their HTML definitions do not allow any content. This is a category error. The syntax rules of a markup language do not restrict what you can do in CSSTo conclude, :after and :before are currently not usable for empty elements (except marginally for hr), but this is mainly due to implementations and may change in the future.Elements that doesn't have closing tag are void elements and they can't display content inside them:https://www.w3.org/TR/html5/syntax.html#void-elementsAll Blink, Webkit and Quantum browsers allow you to create pseudo elements only on checkboxes but this is controversial since no spec allow this behavior.Here an example:\nhttps://codepen.io/equinusocio/pen/BOBaEM/"},

What I mean by victim is that the height and width of a text box is the sum of the height/width properties assigned above, in addition to the padding height/width, and the border width. For this reason, your text boxes will be slightly different sizes in different browsers depending on the default padding in different browsers. Although different browsers tend to define different padding to text boxes, most reset style sheets don't tend to include <input /> tags in their reset sheets, so this is something to keep in mind.You can standardize this by defining your own padding. Here is your CSS with specified padding, so the text box looks the same in all browsers:I added 1 pixel padding because some browsers tend to make the text box look too crammed if the padding is 0px. Depending on your design, you may want to add even more padding, but it is highly recommend you define the padding yourself, otherwise you'll be leaving it up to different browsers to decide for themselves. For even more consistency across browsers, you should also define the border yourself.Your textbox code:Your CSS code:orSo, first you select your element with attributes (look at first example) or classes(look last example). Later, you assign height and width values to your element.This works for me in IE 10 and FF 23If you don't want to use the class method you can use parent-child method to make changes in the text box.For eg. I've made a form in my form div. HTML Code: Now CSS code will be like:Problem solved. Lookout!

You should, of course, in this case, set some margins/paddings in your body element so that the content won't extend all the way to the page's edge. Since  common printers just can't get no-margins printing and it's probably not what you want, you should use something like this:As Martin pointed out in a comment, if the page have a long element that scrolls past one page (like a big table), the margin is ignored and the printed version will look weird.At the time original of this answer (May 2013), it only worked on Chrome, not sure about it now, never needed to try again.

Z-index only works when you have a non static positioning scheme.z-index property enables you to take your control at front. the bigger number you set the upper your element you get.position property should be relative because position of html-element should be position relatively against other controls in all dimensions.I gonna assumed you making a popup with code from WW3 school, correct? \ncheck it css. the .modal one, there're already word z-index there. just change from 1 to 100."},

In this case the scrollbar at the bottom of the window is moved out of the viewport half way and is hard to recognize/reach. This can be avoided using body { margin: 0; } if suitable.

I know I can set the Style to :hover, but I still can't see the html or css of the tooltip. Any ideas?I actually found a trick to do that with the Twitter Bootstrap tooltips. If you open the dev tools (F12) on another monitor, then hover over the element to bring up the tooltip, right click as if you were to select 'Inspect Element'. Leaving that context menu open, move the focus over to the dev tools. The html for the tooltip should show up next to the element its a tooltip for in the HTML. Then you can look at it as if it were another element. If you go back to Chrome the HTML disappears so just something to be aware of.Kind of a weird way but it worked for me so I figured I would share it.This solution works without any extra code.Hit command-option-j to open the console. Click the window-looking button on the top right corner of the console to open the console in a different window.Then, in the Chrome window, hover over the element that triggers the popover, hit command-` however many times you need to focus on the console, then type debugger. That'll freeze the page, then you can inspect the element in the Elements tab. F8 will pause debugging. Mouse over the tooltip, and press F8 while it is displayed. You can now use the inspector to look at the CSS. You would just need to force the tooltip to show as suchNow the tooltip will show regardless of hovering state.Scroll down near the bottom of the DOM where you should see the markup.Update see cneuro's comment for Bootstrap 3.Update see Marko Grešak's answer for Chrome and apparently Safari as well, $0 can be used as a shortcut for the currently selected element. This appears to work in Safari as well.For me, the accepted answer didn't work: clicking in DevTools immediately closed the ToolTip.However, I found https://superuser.com/questions/249050/chrome-keyboard-shortcut-to-pause-script-execution which helped me:You can now inspect the element, with JavaScript paused so the DOM won't change.Click f12 go to the console tab and add the following:This will give you 5 seconds to do whatever you want and it will break at 5 seconds. Then you can inspect the target element(ex. hover the element and wait 5 seconds then inspect..)Single window answer, with no codingNone of the other answers are quite right, or have enough detail, so here's my attempt.No code solution for JS activated tooltips:With Chrome's devtools inspect the containing / parent element of the tooltip. In the \"elements\" tab, right click on that container DOM element then choose \"break on\" > \"subtree modifications\". The next time you hover over the part of the DOM the tooltip is housed in, the JS code will be paused allowing you to inspect the contents of the tooltip. Here’s a simple solution: If you have dynamic tooltips, you can make them “persistent” by (temporarily) changing the trigger event to click. This will have the effect that the tooltip only disappears on a click-out:This way, it can be easily inspected with FF’s or Chrome’s debugging tools.Follow these stepsI had problems with this so I went to the documentation and inspected the tooltip that is already rendered on the page. That helped me see the dom structure of the tooltip and edit it accordingly.In Chome on Linux this can be achieved for JS generated tooltips such as those for references on WikiPedia by doing the following:As stated above, open the dev tools using F12. Open them in another window.\nHighlight the tooltip and click Ctrl-Shift-C (The HTML Inspector). As you move over the tip, the dev window will show the appropriate section.If you need to keep the tip open when you mouse off it, to be able to inspect it in the other window more thoroughly, then right click on the tooltip and leave the context menu up, and click on the the dev tools window. In this scenario it leaves the tip up in the wikipedia window.To a degree it also works with bootstrap tips.For some reason the answers provided here weren't working for me on Windows. I was able to inspect the tooltip by opening the dev tools, then hovering over the element that brings up the tooltip, then right clicking on that element (not the tooltip). Then, move the cursor over into the inspector panel and scroll down to the bottom. The tooltip element should still be there.1)Open the Inspect window by clicking F122)Go to source tab(next to console)3)Now hover on element to be inspected and keep your mouse over there.4)Using keyboard(Tab or shift+tab) to move the control to pause button or F8Refer the image5)When keyboard focus is on Play button. Hit enter. Your hover element will be freezed you can do anything nowThe dev tools provides a way to inspect a hovered element like a tooltip.1 - Open the dev tools using F12. 2 - Select \"Elements\" tab.3 - Select the parent element that contains the tooltip.4 - Click on \"...\" (on the line of the parent element) and after select \"Break on\"/\"subtree modifications\" (see image below)5 - Finally go back to application and make the Tooltip shows up. It should block the execution after the Tooltip gets visible Hope it can be useful for someone!Worth noting that toggling the :hover state from within the dev tools only has an impact if the hint text is enabled via CSS :hover rules in the first place. The toggle only applies the hover state to the element for rendering purposes, but does not trigger a corresponding JavaScript mouseover event.Many frameworks such as AngularJS dynamically attach tooltip HTML to the bottom of the document body via JavaScript when a target element is hovered, so any amount of hovering and inspecting the target element won't help. @joeyyang's answer worked very well for me in this scenario.One of the easiest ways I found is:"},

I cannot tell from the question whether the change in the appearance is the only thing you want to control.I'd recommend to replace all :hover properties to :active when you detect that device supports touch. Just call this function when you do so as touch().I used the not() CSS operator and jQuery's addClass() function. Here is an example, when you click on a list item, it won't hover anymore:For example:HTMLCSSjQueryTry just setting the link color:Edit: or better yet, use the CSS, as Christopher suggestedActually an other way to solve this could be, overwriting the CSS with insertRule.It gives the ability to inject CSS rules to an existing/new stylesheet.\nIn my concrete example it would look like this:Demo with my 4 years old original example:\nhttp://jsfiddle.net/raPeX/21/"},

The first one should work fine for everything provided:A variation of the gif method, but may have performance issues.CodePen examples: http://codepen.io/chrisboon27/pen/ACdkaNo, it's not possible.You could try a CSS pre-processor, though, if you want to do this sort of thing.From what I could see, at least LESS and Sass have functions that can make colors more, or less, transparent.No, that's not possible.If you want to use rgba, you must set each value together. There's no way to only change the alpha.It's now 2017 and this is now possible withOne classic use case for CSS variables is the ability to individualize parts of a property's value.So here, instead of repeating the whole rgba expression once again -\nwe split up or 'individulaize' the rgba values into 2 parts / variables  (one for the rgb value and one for the alpha)Then, on hover we can now just modify the --alpha variable:Individualizing CSS Properties with CSS Variables (Dan Wilson)there is an alternative,you can add a linear-gradient background image onto the original color.also, with css3 filter property,you can do that too,but it seems that it will change the text colorhere is a jsfiddle:https://jsfiddle.net/zhangyu911013/epwyL296/2/Why not use :hover and specify a different opacity in the hover class?I had a similar problem. I had 18 different divs working as buttons, and each with a different color. Rather than figure out the color codes for each or use a div:hover selector to change the opacity (which affects all children) I used the pseudo-class :before like in @Chris Boon's answer. Because I wanted to do the coloring on the individual elements, I used :before to create a transparent white div on :hover. This is a very basic washout.According to CanIUse.com, this should have something like 92% support as of early 2014.

You'll need to write two separate selectors of:According to the W3C, the rgba property doesn't have/support the inherit value.I faced a similar problem. Here's what I did and it works fine( only alpha changes on hover and also the text is not affected) by the following steps:1) Apply a highlighted(or any of your choice) class to whichever element you wish to change background alpha of.2) Get the background color rgba3) Store it in a string and manipulate it(change alpha) as you want on hover(mouseenter and mouseleave)HTML Code:CSS Code:Javascript Code:Working Fiddle:http://jsfiddle.net/HGHT6/1/simple solution :exemple : https://jsfiddle.net/epwyL296/14/just play with alpha of background. if you want light instead of darkness, just replace #000 by #fffSimple workaround with opacity if you can accommodate a slight change in background-color:This is about the simplest way; put this in your css stylesheet:done!"},

In Twitter's Bootstrap all grids are fluid. Columns are defined as percentage of the total width. But the gutter have a fixed width in pixels. By default a padding of 15px on both side of the column. The combination of width in pixels and percentage could be complex. With border-box this calculating is easy because the border-box value (as opposed to the content-box default) makes the final rendered box the declared width, and any border and padding cut inside the box.

This site will convert your classes to inline styles: http://premailer.dialect.ca/The answers here are outdated, as of today Sep 30 2016. Gmail is currently rolling out support for the style tag in the head, as well as media queries.  If Gmail is your only concern, you're safe to use classes like a modern developer!For reference, you can check the official gmail CSS docs.As a side note, Gmail was the only major client that didn't support style (reference, until they update anyway).  That means you can almost safely stop putting styles inline.  Some of the more obscure clients may still need them.  Gmail started basic support for style tags in the head area. Found nothing official yet but you can easily try it yourself.\nIt seems to ignore class and id selectors but basic element selectors work.it will create a style tag in its own head area limited to the div containing the mail bodyI agree with everyone who supports classes AND inline styles. You might have learned this by now, but if there is a single mistake in your style sheet, Gmail will disregard it.You might think that your CSS is perfect, because you've done it so often, why would I have mistakes in my CSS? Run it through the CSS Validator (for example http://www.css-validator.org/) and see what happens. I did that after encountering some Gmail display issues, and to my surprise, several Microsoft Outlook specific style declarations showed up as mistakes.Which made sense to me, so I removed them from the style sheet and put them into a only for Microsoft code block, like so:This is just a simple example, but, who know, it might come in handy some time.As others have said, some email programs will not read the css styles.  If you already have a web email written up you can use the following tool from zurb to inline all of your styles:http://zurb.com/ink/inliner.phpThis comes in extremely handy when using templates like those mentioned above from mailchimp, campaign monitor, etc. as they, as you have found, will not work in some email programs.  This tool leaves your style section for the mail programs that will read it and puts all the styles inline to get more universal readability in the format that you wanted.Note that services and tools for sending emails may be able to inline your CSS for you, allowing CSS in <style> tags to work in Gmail.For instance, if you're sending emails with MailChimp, your CSS from <style> tags will get inlined automatically by default.

Transparent borders require setting background-clip: padding-box; because otherwise the background color of the table cells is displayed on the border.Transparent borders and background-clip are supported in IE9 upwards (and all other modern browsers). If you need IE8 compatibility or don't need actual transparent space you can simply set a white border color and leave the background-clip out.Well, the above does work, here is my solution that requires a little less markup and is more flexible.Make a new div with whatever name (I will just use table-split) and give it a width, without adding content to it, while placing it between necessary divs that need to be separated.You can add whatever width you find necessary.

Before switching the content, I temporarily lock the dimensions of the element so my layout doesn't bounce around during the transition. I've found that using jQuery like this:is causing some funniness, like there are sub-pixel differences between the actual width and the calculated width. (Specifically, I will see a word jump from one line of text to another, indicating the the width has been changed, not just locked.) From another question -- Getting the actual, floating-point width of an element -- I found out that window.getComputedStyle(element).width will return an unrounded calculation. So I changed the above code to something likeAnd with THAT code -- no funny bouncing! That experience seems to suggest that the unrounded value actually does matter to the browser, right? (In my case, Chrome Version 26.0.1410.65.)Ross Allen's answer is a good starting point but using getBoundingClientRect().width will also include the padding and the border width which ain't the case the the jquery's width function:If your intent is to get the width value with the precision, you'll have to remove the padding and the border like this:You can use getComputedStyle for it: Use the following to get an accurate width:"},

The downside (too big in my opinion) is that any browser that doesn't support text-shadow but supports rgba (IE 9) won't render the text unless you use a library such as Modernizr (not tested, just a theory).Firefox uses the text color to determine the color of the dotted border. So say if you do...Firefox will render the dotted border transparent. But of course your text will be transparent too! So we must somehow display the text. text-shadow comes to the rescue:We put a text shadow with no offset and no blur, so that replaces the text. Of course older browser don't understand anything of this, so we must provide a fallback for the color:This is when IE9 comes into play: it supports rgba but not text-shadow, so you will get an apparently empty select box. Get your version of Modernizr with text-shadow detection and do...Enjoy.Well, Duopixel’s answer is plain perfect.

Use this CSS selector as part of your usual CSS reset.

Can I do this on one element? I was hoping to avoid stacking two DOM elements with individual borders.Yep: Use the outline property; it acts as a second border outside of your border. Beware, tho', it can interact in a wonky fashion with margins, paddings and drop-shadows. In some browsers you might have to use a browser-specific prefix as well; in order to make sure it picks up on it: -webkit-outline and the like (although WebKit in particular doesn't require this).This can also be useful in the case where you want to jettison the outline for certain browsers (such as is the case if you want to combine the outline with a drop shadow; in WebKit the outline is inside of the shadow; in FireFox it is outside, so -moz-outline: 0 is useful to ensure that you don't get a gnarly line around your beautiful CSS drop shadow).Edit: Some people have remarked that outline doesn't jive well with IE < 8. While this is true; supporting IE < 8 really isn't something you should be doing.This is very possible. It just takes a little CSS trickery!Is that what you are looking for?Another way is to use box-shadow:See example here.Have you tried the different border styles available within the CSS spec? There's already two border styles that might accommodate your need:OrOutline is good, but only when you want the border all around.Lets say if you want to make it only on bottom or top you can useAnd for bottom:Hope that this helps.Instead of using unsupported and problematic outline just use Example:HTML:CSS:TEST(JSFiddle):If by \"embossing\" you mean two borders around each other with two different colours, there is the outline property (outline-left, outline-right....) but it is poorly supported in the IE family (namely, IE6 and 7 don't support it at all). If you need two borders, a second wrapper element would indeed be best.If you mean using two colours in the same border. Use e.g.there are special border-styles for this as well (ridge, outset and inset) but they tend to vary across browsers in my experience.Not possible, but you should check to see if border-style values like inset, outset or some other, accomplished the effect you want.. (i doubt it though..)CSS3 has the border-image properties, but i do not know about support from browsers yet (more info at http://www.css3.info/preview/border-image/)..Simply write style=\"border:medium double;\" for the html tagYou could use This produces a nice effect."},

I doubt that old IE versions deal with that correctly, but what it's supposed to do is tell the browser about allowable word breaks that it can use if it has to.Now, how exactly would you pick where to stuff those characters?  That depends on the actual string and what it means, I guess."},

So instead of \"images/pattern.png\"You can use\"images/*\"Just to clarify, according to the documentation, every file in an extension is also accessible by an absolute URL like this:Note the <extensionID> is a unique identifier that the extension system generates for each extension.

I think it is the better and simple approach..Honestly, option 1. I would suggest you to look at this example from W3.org(link below).

This makes all sorts of UIs impossible to work with, since you have no way of entering text into textareas without scrolling your page all the way down and losing your place. Is there any way to workaround this bug cleanly? Based on this good analysis of this issue, I've used this in html and body elements in css:I think it's working great for me.The best solution I could come up with is to switch to using position: absolute; on focus and calculating the position it was at when it was using position: fixed;. The trick is that the focus event fires too late, so touchstart must be used.The solution in this answer mimics the correct behavior we had in iOS 7 very closely.The body element must have positioning in order to ensure proper positioning when the element switches to absolute positioning.The following code is a basic example for the provided test-case, and can be adapted for your specific use-case.Here is the same code without the hack for comparison.If the position: fixed; element has any other parent elements with positioning besides body, switching to position: absolute; may have unexpected behavior. Due to the nature of position: fixed; this is probably not a major issue, since nesting such elements is not common.While the use of the touchstart event will filter out most desktop environments, you will probably want to use user-agent sniffing so that this code will only run for the broken iOS 8, and not other devices such as Android and older iOS versions. Unfortunately, we don't yet know when Apple will fix this issue in iOS, but I would be surprised if it is not fixed in the next major version.I found a method that works without the need to change to position absolute!Full uncommented codeBreaking it downFirst you need to have the fixed input field toward the top of the page in the HTML (it's a fixed element so it should semantically make sense to have it near the top anyway):Then you need to save the current scroll position into global variables:Then you need a way to detect iOS devices so it doesn't affect things that don't need the fix (function taken from https://stackoverflow.com/a/9039885/1611058)Now that we have everything we need, here is the fix :)I was able to fix this for select inputs by adding an event listener to the necessary select elements, then scrolling by an offset of one pixel when the select in question gains focus.This isn't necessarily a good solution, but it's much simpler and more reliable than the other answers I've seen here. The browser seems to re-render/re-calculate the position: fixed; attribute based on the offset supplied in the window.scrollBy() function.Much like Mark Ryan Sallee suggested, I found that dynamically changing the height and overflow of my background element is the key - this gives Safari nothing to scroll to.So after the modal's opening animation finishes, change the background's styling:When you close the modal change it back:While other answers are useful in simpler contexts, my DOM was too complicated (thanks SharePoint) to use the absolute/fixed position swap.Cleanly? no.I recently had this problem myself with a fixed search field in a sticky header, the best you can do at the moment is keep the scroll position in a variable at all times and upon selection make the fixed element's position absolute instead of fixed with a top position based on the document's scroll position. This is however very ugly and still results in some strange back and forth scrolling before landing on the right place, but it is the closest I could get.Any other solution would involve overriding the default scroll mechanics of the browser.This is now fixed in iOS 10.3! Hacks should no longer be needed. Haven't dealt with this particular bug, but maybe put an overflow: hidden; on the body when the text area is visible (or just active, depending on your design). This may have the effect of not giving the browser anywhere \"down\" to scroll to.A possible solution would be to replace the input field.codepenNone of these solutions worked for me because my DOM is complicated and I have dynamic infinite scroll pages, so I had to create my own.Background: I am using a fixed header and an element further down that sticks below it once the user scrolls that far down. This element has a search input field. In addition, I have dynamic pages added during forward and backwards scroll.Problem: In iOS, anytime the user clicked on the input in the fixed element, the browser would scroll all the way to the top of the page. This not only caused undesired behavior, it also triggered my dynamic page add at the top of the page.Expected Solution: No scroll in iOS (none at all) when the user clicks on the input in the sticky element.Solution:Requirements: JQuery mobile is required for the startsroll and stopscroll functions to work.Debounce is included to smooth out any lag created by the sticky element.Tested in iOS10.I just jumped over something like this yesterday by setting height of #a to max visible height (body height was in my case) when #b is visibleex: ps: sorry for late example, just noticed it was needed.I had the issue, below lines of code resolved it for me -"},

Take this for example:CSSIn the following code you can see how I included the original @media query that handles the drop before the 979px mark and the new query to support your desired drop point of 550px. I modified the original query straight from the bootstrap-responsive css to reset all the styles applied to that specific query for the navbar elements and ported them to the new query that carries the drop point you need instead. This way we can commute all the styles from the original query down to the new query without messing around in the bootstrap-responsive stylesheet, this way the default values will still apply to the other elements in your document.Here is a short demo with a media query set to drop at 550px as you require:\nhttp://jsfiddle.net/wU8MW/Note: I placed the above modified @media queries way down below the css frame as the new modified css is supposed to be loaded first than the responsive css.bootstrap-sass will support the variable $navbarCollapseWidth in the next version (2.2.1.0).

I was wondering if there are implications to using this transform in the following manner:CSS transformations create a new stacking context and containing block, as described in the spec. In plain English, this means that fixed position elements with a transformation applied to them will act more like absolutely positioned elements, and z-index values are likely to get screwed with.If you take a look at this demo, you'll see what I mean. The second div has a transformation applied to it, meaning that it creates a new stacking context, and the pseudo elements are stacked on top rather than below.So basically, don't do that. Apply a 3D transformation only when you need the optimization. -webkit-font-smoothing: antialiased; is another way to tap into 3D acceleration without creating these problems, but it only works in Safari.If you want implications, in some scenarios Google Chrome performance is horrible with hardware acceleration enabled. Oddly enough, changing the \"trick\" to -webkit-transform: rotateZ(360deg); worked just fine.I don't believe we ever figured out why.It forces the browser to use hardware acceleration to access the device’s graphical processing unit (GPU) to make pixels fly. Web applications, on the other hand, run in the context of the browser, which lets the software do most (if not all) of the rendering, resulting in less horsepower for transitions. But the Web has been catching up, and most browser vendors now provide graphical hardware acceleration by means of particular CSS rules.Using -webkit-transform: translate3d(0,0,0); will kick the GPU into action for the CSS transitions, making them smoother (higher FPS).Note: translate3d(0,0,0) does nothing in terms of what you see. It moves the object by 0px in x,y and z axis. It's only a technique to force the hardware acceleration.Good read here: http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2012/06/21/play-with-hardware-accelerated-css/I can attest to the fact that -webkit-transform: translate3d(0, 0, 0); will mess with the new position: -webkit-sticky; property. With a left drawer navigation pattern that I was working on, the hardware acceleration I wanted with the transform property was messing with the fixed positioning of my top nav bar. I turned off the transform and the positioning worked fine. Luckily, I seem to have had hardware acceleration on already, because I had -webkit-font-smoothing: antialiased on the html element. I was testing this behavior in iOS7 and Android. On mobile devices sending everything to the GPU will cause a memory overload and crash the application. I encountered this on an iPad app in Cordova. Best to only send the required items to the GPU, the divs that you're specifically moving around. Better yet, use the 3d transitions transforms to do the animations like translateX(50px) as opposed to left:50px;"},

To center it, just push the pseudo-element the half of its width (50% / 2 = 25%) to the right....as davidmatas commented, using margin:auto is sometimes more practical, than calculating the margin-offset by hand.So, we can align the underline to the left, right or center (without knowing the current width) by using one of these combinations:Full exampleThis can easily be adopted, so that we can use block-level elements. The trick is to set the pseudo-elements height to the same height as its real element (simply height:100%):Here is another solution that rely on linear-gradient where you can easily create any kind of line you want. You can also have multiple lines (on each side for example) by using multiple background:Here is another syntax to achieve the same as above:I used a grid to build draw some of the borders.See here.Code:CSS does not support partial borders.

CSS would also be preferable to javascript.EDIT: Should mention that the images are of different sizes and aspect ratios.Adam Luter gave me the idea for this, but it actually turned out to be really simple:IE6 now scales the image fine and this seems to be what all the other browsers use by default.Thanks for both the answers though!I'm glad that worked out, so I guess you had to explicitly set 'auto' on IE6 in order for it to mimic other browsers!I actually recently found another technique for scaling images, again designed for backgrounds.  This technique has some interesting features:The markup relies on a wrapper element:Given the above markup you then use these rules:If you then control the size of wrapper you get the interesting scale effects that I list above.To be explicit, consider the following base state: A container that is 100x100 and an image that is 10x10.  The result is a scaled image of 100x100.So, in other words, the image is always at least as big as the container, but will scale beyond it to maintain it's aspect ratio.This probably isn't useful for your site, and it doesn't work in IE6.  But, it is useful to get a scaled background for your view port or container.Well, I can think of a CSS hack that will resolve this issue.You could add the following line in your CSS file:The above code will only be seen by IE6.\nThe aspect ratio won't be perfect, but you could make it look somewhat normal.\nIf you really wanted to make it perfect, you would need to write some javascript that would read the original picture width, and set the ratio accordingly to specify a height.The only way to do explicit scaling in CSS is to use tricks such as found here.IE6 only, you could also use filters (check out PNGFix).  But applying them automatically to the page will need javascript, though that javascript could be embedded in the CSS file.If you are going to require javascript, then you might want to just have javascript fill in the missing value for the height by inspecting the image once the content has loaded.  (Sorry I do not have a reference for this technique).Finally, and pardon me for this soapbox, you might want to eschew IE6 support in this matter.  You could add _width: auto after your width: 75px rule, so that IE6 at least renders the image reasonably, even if it is the wrong size.I recommend the last solution simply because IE6 is on the way out: 20% and going down almost a percent a month.  Also, I note that your site is recreational and in the UK.  Both of these help the demographic lean to be away from IE6:  IE6 usage drops nearly 40% during weekends (no citation sorry), and UK has a much lower IE6 demographic (again no citation, sorry).Good luck!"},

They fade on hover but take no space when hidden, perfect!I changed a bit but the result is beautiful.Thank you to everyone.There is another good method to get this done by using pointer-events:Unfortunately, this is not supported in IE10 and below.I had the same problem.  I tried using animations instead of transitions - as suggested by @MichaelMullany and @Chris - but it only worked for webkit browsers even if I copy-pasted with \"-moz\" and \"-o\" prefixes.I was able to get around the problem by using visibility instead of display.  This works for me because my child element is position: absolute, so document flow isn't being affected.  It might work for others too.This is what the original code would look like using my solution:If you are triggering the change with JS, let's say on click, there is a nice workaround. You see the problem happens because the animation is ignored on display:none element but browser applies all the changes at once and the element is never display:block while not animated at the same time. The trick is to ask the browser to render the frame after changing the visibility but before triggering the animation.Here is a JQuery example:On absolute or fixed elements you could also use z-index:Other elements should have a z-index between -100 and 100 now.I know, this is not really a solution for your question, because you ask for My approach solves a more general question, but maybe this was the background problem that should be solved by using display in combination with opacity.My desire was to get the Element out of the way when it is not visible.\nThis solution does exactly that: It moves the element out of the away, and this can be used for transition:This code does not contain any browser prefixes or backward compatibility hacks. It just illustrates the concept how the element is moved away as it is not needed any more.The interesting part are the two different transition definitions. When the mouse-pointer is hovering the .parent element the .child element needs to be put in place immediately and then the opacity will be changed:When there is no hover, or the mouse-pointer was moved off the element, one has to wait until the opacity change has finished before the element can be moved off screen:Moving the object away will be a viable alternative in a case where setting display:none would not break the layout.I hope I hit the nail on the head for this question although I did not answer it.HOW TO ANIMATE OPACITY WITH CSS:\nthis is my code:\nthe CSS codeor check this demo fileOne thing that I did was set the initial state's margin to be something like \"margin-left: -9999px\" so it does not appear on the screen, and then reset \"margin-left: 0\" on the hover state. Keep it \"display: block\" in that case. Did the trick for me :)Edit: Save the state and not revert to previous hover state? Ok here we need JS:To have animation on both ways onHoverIn/Out I did this solution. Hope it will help to someonedisplay: is not transitionable.

All you need is to write your fix tag like this, and put it in your body sectionWith the current Bootstrap version (3.3.2) there is a nice way to achieve a fixed sidebar for navigation. This solution also works well with the re-introduced container-fluid class, meaning it is easily possible to have a responsive full-screen layout.Normally you would need to use fixed widths and margins or the navigation would overlap the content, but with the help of the empty placeholder column the content is always positioned in the right place.The below setup wraps the content around when you resize the window to less than 768px and releases the fixed navigation.See http://www.bootply.com/ePvnTy1VII for a working example.CSSHTML"},

The following link is to a working demo:Link Updated according to lanoxx's commenthttp://jsfiddle.net/C8Dtf/366/Just remember to add these:i don't see any other way of achieving this. Especially not by using css only.This is a lot to go through. Hope this helps :)All of these suggestions are great and all, but they're either only fixing either the header or a column, not both, or they're using javascript. The reason - it don't believe it can be done in pure CSS. The reason:If it were possible to do it, you would need to nest several scrollable divs one inside the other, each with a scroll in a different direction. Then you would need to split your table into three parts - the fixed header, the fixed column and the rest of the data. Fine. But now the problem - you can make one of them stay put when you scroll, but the other one is nested inside the scrolling area of first and is therefore subject to being scrolled out of sight itself, so can't be fixed in place on the screen. 'Ah-ha' you say 'but I can somehow use absolute or fixed position to do that' - no you can't. As soon as you do that you lose the ability to scroll that container. It's a chicken and egg situation - you can't have both, they cancel each other out.I believe the only solution is through javascript. You need to completely seperate out the three elements and keep their positions in sync through javascript. There are good examples in other posts on this page. This one is also worth a look:http://tympanus.net/codrops/2014/01/09/sticky-table-headers-columns/I've made some changes in in jsfiddle. This might be what you're trying to do.I have hardcoded the titles like so:And I added some styles as well.Hope this is what you want :)An example using only CSS:To fix both Headers and Columns, you can use the following plugin:Updated in July 2019Recently is emerged also a pure CSS solution that is based on CSS property position: sticky; (here for more details about it) applied onto each TH item (instead of their parent container)I recently had to create a solution with a fixed header group and a fixed first column. I split my table into div's and used jquery to capture window scrolling.http://jsfiddle.net/TinT/EzXub/2346/A co-worker and I have just released a new GitHub project that supplies an Angular directive that you can use to decorate your table with fixed headers: https://github.com/objectcomputing/FixedHeaderIt relies on css and angular only, with a directive that adds some divs. There is no jQuery required.This implementation isn't as fully-featured as some other implementations, but if your need is simply to add fixed tables, we think this might be a good option.After two days fighting with Internet Explorer 9 + Chrome + Firefox (Windows) and Safari (Mac), I have found a system that is Result:\nHTML:\n  \n    CSS:need to fix header footerI found an excellent solution by Paul O'Brien for the issue and would like share the link:\nhttps://codepen.io/paulobrien/pen/LBrMxaI removed style for footer:Something like this may work for you... It will probably require you to have set column widths for your header row.http://jsfiddle.net/vkhNC/Update:I am not convinced that the example you gave is possible with just CSS.  I would love for someone to prove me wrong.  Here is what I have so far.  It is not the finished product but it could be a start for you.  I hope this points you in a helpful direction, wherever that may be.Another solution is to use AngularJS. The AngularUI module has a directive called ng-grid which supports a feature called column pinning. It is not 100% pure CSS but neither are the other solutions.http://angular-ui.github.io/ng-grid/#columnPinninghttp://jsfiddle.net/cCarlson/L98m854d/Drawback: The fixed header structure/logic is fairly dependent upon specific dimensions, so abstraction is probably not a viable option.The existing answers will suit most people, but for those who are looking to add shadows under the fixed header and to the right of the first (fixed) column, here's a working example (pure css):http://jsbin.com/nayifepaxo/1/edit?html,outputThe main trick in getting this to work is using ::after to add shadows to the right of each of the first td in each tr:Took me a while (too long...) to get it all working so I figured I'd share for those who are in a similar situation.Position : sticky doesn't work for some elements like (thead) in chrome and other webkit browsers like safari.But it works fine with (th)Or visit my codepen example : I think this will help you:\n    https://datatables.net/release-datatables/extensions/FixedHeader/examples/header_footer.htmlIn a nutshell, if you know how to create a dataTable, You just need to add this jQuery line to your bottom:bottom: true    // is for making the Bottom header fixed as well.If you only want to use pure HTML and CSS i've got a solution for your problem:\nIn this jsFiddle you can see a non-script solution that provides a table with a fixed header.\nIt shouldn't be a problem to adapt the markup for a fixed first column as well.\nYou would just need to create a absolute-positioned table for the first column inside the hWrapper-div and reposition the vWrapper-div.\nProviding dynamic content should not be a problem using server-side or browser-side tempting-engines, my solution works well in all modern browsers and older browsers from IE8 onwards.Just need to change style as Demo: https://plnkr.co/edit/Qxy5RMJBXmkaJAOjBtQn?p=preview"},

Doing it this way adds no extra elements to the DOM, and adding/removing the strikethrough is a simple as adding/removing the class.Here's a demoYou can use background linear-gradient with currentColor to avoid hardcoding font color:If you don't need the element to be fully inline, you can use a pseudo element to place the line on top of the element.

You might have to pull off some funky VML code to support older versions of IE, for example.CSS3 gradientMy example won't fill your needs perfectly but, for more info and funny tweaks, see http://gradients.glrzad.com/.What you have to do is create a background-gradient of white-black-white and position your opacity at something like 48% 50% 52%.I don't think there is a sustainable css solution to this.My pure CSS solution would be to place another element of text behind your first element of text that  is identical in number of characters (characters being ' '), a text-decleration of line-through, and a transform of rotate.Something like:Text Rotation exampleI am looking forward to seeing better answers from other users.This is an old question but as an alternative you can use CSS3 Linear Gradients for example (http://codepen.io/yusuf-azer/pen/ojJLoG).For extensive explaining and a LESS Solution checkhttp://www.yusufazer.com/tutorials-how-to/how-to-make-a-diagonal-line-through-with-css3/I did it this way using an SVG in the HTM with a CSS class:HTML:CSS:There might be simpler easier ways by now.

Is this possible?  I tried this: http://jsfiddle.net/Zf5am/565/But I can't get the div to show up.  I'd suggest using a pseudo element in place of the overlay element. Because pseudo elements can't be added on enclosed img elements, you would still need to wrap the img element though.LIVE EXAMPLE HERE -- EXAMPLE WITH TEXTAs for the CSS, set optional dimensions on the .image element, and relatively position it. If you are aiming for a responsive image, just omit the dimensions and this will still work (example). It's just worth noting that the dimensions must be on the parent element as opposed to the img element itself, see.Give the child img element a width of 100% of the parent and add vertical-align:top to fix the default baseline alignment issues.As for the pseudo element, set a content value and absolutely position it relative to the .image element. A width/height of 100% will ensure that this works with varying img dimensions. If you want to transition the element, set an opacity of 0 and add the transition properties/values.Use an opacity of 1 when hovering over the pseudo element in order to facilitate the transition:END RESULT HEREFor the simplest approach, just add the text as the pseudo element's content value:EXAMPLE HEREThat should work in most instances; however, if you have more than one img element, you might not want the same text to appear on hover. You could therefore set the text in a data-* attribute and therefore have unique text for every img element.EXAMPLE HEREWith a content value of attr(data-content), the pseudo element adds the text from the .image element's data-content attribute:You can add some styling and do something like this:EXAMPLE HEREIn the above example, the :after pseudo element serves as the black overlay, while the :before pseudo element is the caption/text. Since the elements are independent of each other, you can use separate styling for more optimal positioning.Although this feature is only implemented in webkit, and it doesn't have browser compatibility, but It's worth taking a look at:JSFiddle DemoYou were close. This will work:You needed to put the :hover on image, and make the .overlay cover the whole image by adding right:0; and bottom:0.jsfiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/Zf5am/569/Here's a good way using :after on the image div, instead of the extra overlay div: http://jsfiddle.net/Zf5am/576/.overlay didn't have a height or width and no content, and you can't hover over display:none.I instead gave the div the same size and position as .image and changes RGBA value on hover.http://jsfiddle.net/Zf5am/566/You can accomplish this by playing with the opacity of the image and setting the background color of the image to black. By making the image transparent, it will appear darker.CSS:You might need to set the browser-specific opacity too to make this work in other browsers too.I would give a min-height and min-width to your overlay div of the size of the image, and change the background color on hoverSee what I've done here: http://jsfiddle.net/dyarbrough93/c8wEC/First off, you never set the dimensions of the overlay, meaning it wasn't showing up in the first place. Secondly, I recommend just changing the z-index of the overlay when you hover over the image. Change the opacity / color of the overlay to suit your needs.   "},

If you're a massive site and you wish to internationalize your content, then this image-less technique is actually really cool.

Google gets a lot of bang for the buck by making something like this because of the vast number of buttons and languages that they need; I suspect that most sites and applications would be just as well-off using an image.An open-source component is a good idea, though: spread the wealth and effort widely.The majority of the work here probably won't be the design - those posts are already an excellent How-To on the gradient effects.The problem is getting this working in all browsers, or more specifically the quirky piles of rubbish that are IE6 and IE7.I think you're on the right track with a standard button that gets re-written with jQuery - that way you'll still be accessible for screen readers and can degrade nicely in really old browsers.For the HTML I think your best bet is to visit Gmail with each browser and see what HTML is produced - I'd expect it to be completely different for IE6, IE7, (also depending on whether they need quirks-mode) and everything else. These were released as part of the closure library: see the button demoThe Web Developer Toolbar has a view style information under the css menu that will tell  you what css is applied to an item. There is also the Edit CSS feature in that menu that will let you change the CSS on the fly to see how it affects the page.The post with a link to the closure library does not apply. What was released as part of the closure library uses buttons with gradients.The other solutions listed are useless. You cannot go from there and get these buttons working on every browser Gmail has them working. What Bowman shows on his site is not working code."},

You'll also want to have position: relative on .container_row if you want the absolutely positioned elements to be positioned with respect to their parent rather than the document's body:Your problem is that position: absolute removes elements from the normal flow:This means that absolutely positioned elements have no effect whatsoever on their parent element's size and your first <div class=\"container_row\"> will have a height of zero.So you can't do what you're trying to do with absolutely positioned elements unless you know how tall they're going to be (or, equivalently, you can specify their height). If you can specify the heights then you can put the same heights on the .container_row and everything will line up; you could also put a margin-top on the second .container_row to leave room for the absolutely positioned elements. For example:Actually this is possible without position absolute and specifying any height. All You need to do, is use display: grid on parent element and put descendants, into the same row and column.Please check example below, based on Your HTML. I added only <span> and some colors, so You can see the result.You can also easily change z-index each of descendant elements, to manipulate its visibility (which one should be on top). Great answer, \"mu is too short\".\nI was seeking the exact same thing, and after reading your post I found a solution that fitted my problem.I was having two elements of the exact same size and wanted to stack them.\nAs each have same size, what I could do was to makeon only the last element. This way the first element is inserted correctly, \"pushing\" the parents height, and the second element is placed on top.Hopes this helps other people trying to stacking 2+ elements with same (unknown) height.I had to set Container_height = Element1_height = Element2_heightUse can use z-index to set which one to be on top.Here's another solution using display: flex instead of position: absolute or display: grid.Due to absolute positioning removing the elements from the document flow position: absolute is not the right tool for the job. Depending on the exact layout you want to create you will be successful using negative margins, position:relative or maybe even transform: translate.\nShow us a sample of what you want to do we can help you better.Of course, the problem is all about getting your height back. But how can you do that if you don't know the height ahead of time? Well, if you know what aspect ratio you want to give the container (and keep it responsive), you can get your height back by adding padding to another child of the container, expressed as a percentage.You can even add a dummy div to the container and set something like padding-top: 56.25% to give the dummy element a height that is a proportion of the container's width. This will push out the container and give it an aspect ratio, in this case 16:9 (56.25%).Padding and margin use the percentage of the width, that's really the trick here.After much testing, I have verified that the original question is already right; missing just a couple of settings:Here's some reusable css that will preserve the height of each element without using position: absolute:The first element in your stack is the background, and the second is the foreground."},

{"title": "What is the difference between a pseudo-class and a pseudo-element in CSS?", "author": "tybro0103", "date": "2011-11-09 18:48:34Z", "question": "Things like a:link or div::after...Information on the difference seems scarce.", "url": "[What is the difference between a pseudo-class and a pseudo-element in CSS?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8069973/what-is-the-difference-between-a-pseudo-class-and-a-pseudo-element-in-css)", "vote": 89, "content": "Things like a:link or div::after...Information on the difference seems scarce.The CSS 3 selector recommendation is pretty clear about both, but I'll try to show the differences anyway.SourceThe important nature of pseudo-classes is stated in the very first sentence: \"the pseudo-class concept [...] permit selection\". It enables the author of an stylesheet to differ between elements based on information that \"lies outside of the document tree\", for example the current status of a link (:active,:visited). Those aren't saved anywhere in the DOM, and there exists no DOM interface to access these options.On the other hand, :target could be accessed via DOM manipulation (you could use window.location.hash in order to find the object with JavaScript), but this  \"cannot be expressed using the other simple selectors\".So basically a pseudo-class will refine the set of selected elements as any other simple selector in a sequence of simple selectors. Note that all simple selectors in a sequence of simple selectors will be evaluated at the same time. For a complete list of pseudo-class check the CSS3 selector recommendation.The following example will color all even rows gray (#ccc), all uneven rows which aren't dividable by 5 white and every other row magenta.SourceThe most important part here is that \"pseudo-elements allow authors to refer to [..] otherwise inaccessible information\" and that they \"may also provide authors a way to refer to content that does not exist in the source document (e.g., the ::before and ::after pseudo-elements give access to generated content).\". The biggest difference is that they actually create a new virtual element on which rules and even pseudo-class selectors can be applied to. They don't filter elements, they basically filter content (::first-line,::first-letter) and wrap it in a virtual container, which the author can style however he want (well, almost).For example the ::first-line pseudo-element cannot be reconstructed with JavaScript, as it heavily depends on the current used font, the fonts size, the elements width, floating elements (and probably the time of the day). Well, that's not entirely true: one could still calculate all those values and extract the first line, however doing so is a very cumbersome activity.I guess the biggest difference is that \"only one pseudo-element may appear per selector\". The note says that this could be subject to change, but as of 2012 I don't believe we see any different behavior in the future (it's still in CSS4).The following example will add a language-tag to every quote on a given page using the pseudo-class :lang and the pseudo-element ::after:Pseudo-classes act as simple selectors in a sequence of selectors and thereby classify elements on non-presentational characteristics, pseudo-elements create new virtual elements.A pseudo-class filters existing elements.\na:link means all <a>s that are :link.A pseudo-element is a new fake element.\ndiv::after means non-existing elements after <div>s.::selection is another example of a pseudo-element.\nIt doesn't mean all elements that are selected; it means the range of content that is selected, which may span portions of multiple elements.Short description that helped me to understand the difference:From the Sitepoint docs:A conceptual answer:Below is the simple answer:We use pseudo-class when we need to apply css based on the state of an element. Such as:We use pseudo-element when we need to apply css to the specific parts of an elements or a newly inserted content. Such as:Below is the example of both:Pseudo-ClassA pseudo-class is way of selecting certain parts of a HTML document, based in principle not on the HTML document tree itself and its elements or on characteristics like name, attributes or contents, but on other phantom conditions like language encoding or the dynamic state of an element.The original pseudo-class defined dynamic states of an element that are entered and exited over time, or through user intervention. CSS2 expanded on this concept to include virtual conceptual document components or inferred portions of the document tree e.g. first-child. Pseudo-classes operate as if phantom classes were added to various elements.RESTRICTIONS: Unlike pseudo-elements, pseudo-classes can appear anywhere in selector chain.Example pseudo-class code:A page that demonstrates a rendering of the above pseudo-class codePseudo-elementsPSEUDO-ELEMENTS are used to address sub-parts of elements. They allow you to set style on a part of an element's content beyond what is specified in the documents. In other words they allow logical elements to be defined which are not actually in the document element tree. Logical elements allow implied semantic structure to be addressed in CSS selectors.RESTRICTIONS: Pseudo-elements may only be applied to external and document-level contexts - not to in-line styles. Pseudo-elements are restricted in where they can appear in a rule. They may only appear at the end of a selector chain (after the subject of the selector). They should come after any class or ID names found in the selector. Only one pseudo-element can be specified per selector. To address multiple pseudo-elements on a single element structure, multiple style selector/declaration statements must be made.Pseudo-elements can be used for common typographic effects such as initial caps and drop caps. They can also address generated content that is not in the source document (with the \"before\" and \"after\") An example style sheet of some pseudo-elements with properties and values added follows./* The following rule selects the first letter of a heading 1 and sets the font to 2em, cursive, with a green background. First-letter selects the first rendered letter/character for a block-level element. */Sources:LinkIn brief, from Pseudo-classes on MDN:And, from Pseudo-elements on MDN:"},

I'm still working on making this work for IE and Opera.The key is putting the content inside of the div to which the filter is applied:And then the CSS:So mask has the filters applied. Also, note the use of url() for a filter with an <svg> tag for the value -- that idea came from http://codepen.io/AmeliaBR/pen/xGuBr.

Any ideas?Try this, if you don't mind not having borders.Something like this will work, depending on your browser support requirements:People will always have controversial opinions about using empty table elements to layout a page (as evidenced by this answer's downvote).  I recognize this, but sometimes its easier to use them this way when you are working in a \"quick and dirty\" way.  I've used empty rows in past projects to space groups of table rows.  I assigned the spacer rows a css class of their own and defined a height for that class that acted as a top and bottom margin for that group of table rows.  If you don't have borders on your table cells, you could also define a height to your typical cell or row in your style sheet that evenly spaces out all rows of your table.I had been in trouble spacing properly multiple <tbody> with ::before pseudo, in presence of <tr> containing <td> with rowspan in a couple of browsers.Basically, if you have a <tbody> structured like this:And you follow who advises to write css on ::before pseudo element like this:This will affect the rowspan, making table \"losing\" within the second <tr> how many <td>-rowspan are present in the first one.So, if anyone encounters that type of problem, the solution is to style ::before pseudo in this way:Here's a fiddleHere's another possibility that relies on :first-child which is not available in all browsers:Just set display as block and it will work.Of all of the answers given above, only djenson47's answers retain separation of presentation and content. The drawback of the collapsed border model method is that you can no longer use the table's border or cellspacing attributes to separate the individual cells. You could argue that this is a good thing, and there are some workarounds, but it can be a pain. So I think the first-child method is the most elegant.Alternatively, you could also set your TBODY class' overflow property to anything other than \"visible.\" This method allows you to retain a separated borders model as well:Because padding can be applied to TD's, you can do a trick with the + sign. Then it will be possible to give a top padding to the TD's of the first TR of a tbody:I have added the \"tbody + tbody\" so the first tbody won't have a top padding. However, it's not required.As far as I know there are no drawbacks :), though didn't test the older browsers.You can use border-spacing in a table with table row groups to add a space between those groups. Though, I don't think there is a way to specify which groups are spaced and which are not.CSSYou can use as many <tbody> tags as you like. I didn't realize that was ok by W3C until now. Not to say my below solution doesn't work (it does), but to do what you're trying to do, assign your <tbody> tags classes and then reference their individual <td> tags through CSS like so:and your HTML thusly:Try that guy out :)whatever you do, DON'T insert blank rows...you shouldn't have more than 1 tbody element in your table. what you can do is set the class or id attribute in your <tr> elements and give their corresponding <td> tags padding:You can even assign the top and bottom <tr>'s an additional class so that they only do top or bottom padding, respectively:and in your HTML, your <tr> tag would look like this:Hope this helps!djensen47 answer works great for newer browsers, however, as it was pointed out, IE7 it does not work in.My workaround for this issue to support the older browsers was to wrap each cells contents inside a div.  Then add a margin-top to the div.CSSThe height setting keeps the cells at least 30px high to prevent any cell coloring used inside the div from collapsing around the text.  The margin-top creates the desired space by making the entire row taller.Came across this while trying to solve it myself. I had success with putting a <br> tag right before the closing </tbody> tag. It is a purely visual fix, but seems to work on most browsers I tested.Should be accessible as well."},

Assuming you havee.g. any of the following would override it:The first two “win” by selector specificity; the third one wins by !important, a blunt instrument.You could also organize your style sheets so that e.g. the rulewins simply by order, i.e. by being after an otherwise equally “powerful” rule. But this imposes restrictions and requires you to be careful in any reorganization of style sheets.These are all examples of the CSS Cascade, a crucial but widely misunderstood concept. It defines the exact rules for resolving conflicts between style sheet rules.P.S. I used left and background-none as they were used in the question. They are examples of class names that should not be used, since they reflect specific rendering and not structural or semantic roles.Just use !important it will help to override Take a look at this : when-using-important-is-the-right-choiceAs an alternative to the important keyword, you could make the selector more specific,\nfor example:(Note: no space between the class names).In this case, the rule will apply when both .left and .background-none are listed in the class attribute (regardless of the order or proximity).You should override by increasing Specificity of your styling. There are different ways of increasing the Specificity. Usage of !important which effects specificity, is a bad practice because it breaks natural cascading in your style sheet. Following diagram taken from css-tricks.com will help you produce right specificity for your element based on a points structure. Whichever specificity has higher points, will win. Sounds like a game - doesn't it?Checkout sample calculations here on css-tricks.com. This will help you understand the concept very well and it will only take 2 minutes. If you then like to produce and/or compare different specificities by yourself, try this Specificity Calculator: https://specificity.keegan.st/ or you can just use traditional paper/pencil.  For further reading try MDN Web Docs.All the best for not using !important.If you list the bakground-none class after the other classes, its properties will override those already set. There is no need to use !important here.For example:andThe link will not have a red background. Please note that this only overrides properties that have a selector that is less or equally specific.LIFO is the way browser parses CSS properties..If you are using Sass declare a variable called as use it instead of directly assigning values like red or blue.\nWhen you want to override just reassign the value to thenit should smoothly override.

Your directory structure for css should be like:Notice that your /styles directory should be under /staticThen, do thisFlask will now look for the css file under static/styles/mainpage.cssIn jinja2 templates (which flask uses), useThe static files are usually in the static folder, though, unless configured otherwise.I have read multiple threads and none of them fixed the issue that people are describing and I have experienced too.I have even tried to move away from conda and use pip, to upgrade to python 3.7, i have tried all coding proposed and none of them fixed. And here is why (the problem):by default python/flask search the static and the template in a folder structure like: you can verify by yourself using the debugger on Pycharm (or anything else) and check the values on the app (app = Flask(name)) and search for teamplate_folder and static_folderin order to fix this, you have to specify the values when creating the app something like this: the path TEMPLATE_DIR and STATIC_DIR depend on where the file app is located. in my case, see the picture, it was located within a folder under src.you can change the template and static folders as you wish and register on the app = Flask...In truth, I have started experiencing the problem when messing around with folder and at times worked at times not. this fixes the problem once and for allthe html code looks like this:         This the codeHere the structure of the foldersI'm running version 1.0.2 of flask right now.\nThe above file structures did not work for me, but I found one that did, which are as follows:(Please note that 'static' and 'templates' are folders, which should be named exactly the same thing.)To check what version of flask you are running, you should open Python in terminal and type the following accordingly:The flask project structure is different. As you mentioned in question the project structure is the same but the only problem is wit the styles folder. Styles folder must come within the static folder.Still having problems after following the solution provided by codegeek:  <link rel= \"stylesheet\" type= \"text/css\" href= \"{{ url_for('static',filename='styles/mainpage.css') }}\"> ?In Google Chrome pressing the reload button (F5) will not reload the static files. If you have followed the accepted solution but still don't see the changes you have made to CSS, then press ctrl + shift + R to ignore cached files and reload the static files.In Firefox pressing the reload button appears to reload the static files.In Edge pressing the refresh button does not reload the static file. Pressing ctrl + shift + R is supposed to ignore cached files and reload the static files. However this does not work on my computer. I'm pretty sure it's similar to Laravel template, this is how I did mine.Referred:\nCSS file pathing problemSimple flask application that reads its content from a .html file.

It can be further customized so that you can use it side by side with the standard left aligned tabs.To use it, add \"centered\" class to your tabs element Adding the class nav-justified works for me. This not only center aligns the tabs but it also spreads them nicely at the top.Even though the accepted answer works well, I found the above more natural to Bootstrap.Simply addingwhen I set up my tabs, worked for me.For e.g.You can just use bootstrap grid to center your nav-tabs. Since bootstrap grid is divided on 12 equals columns, you can easily use 4 columns for your navigation with 4 columns offset:<div class=\"col-sm-4 col-sm-offset-4\">. Therefore your are getting your navigation in the middle of the page (also responsive solution) with 4 columns free on the left and the right side. I found grid really useful for making responsive web pages. \nGood luck! if you use bs4 simply you can add justify-content-center class to your nav-tabs to center it on page. if you want your tabs to be justified (full-with) add nav-justified class to it, in this case if you have 3 items in your nav each of them has 33% with. if 5 items is there each one have 20% with. another way is simply to add text-center if you are use bs3 .Try This:"},

I have a list like this:It is not possible for me to insert anything in the li's such as a 'span' og a 'p'.

And without an image you won't be able to change the color of the bullets only and not the text.Using an imageSeelist-style-imageWithout using an imageThen you have to edit the HTML markup and include a span inside the list and color the li and span with different colors.I managed this without adding markup, but instead using li:before. This obviously has all the limitations of :before (no old IE support), but it seems to work with IE8, Firefox and Chrome after some very limited testing. The bullet style is also limited by what's in unicode.We can combine list-style-image with svgs, which we can inline in css! This method offers incredible control over the \"bullets\", which can become anything.To get a red circle, just use the following css:But this is just the beginning. This allows us to do any crazy thing we want with those bullets. circles or rectangles are easy, but anything you can draw with svg you can stick in there! Check out the bullseye example below: Some browsers require width and height attributes to be set on the <svg>, or they display nothing. At time of writing, recent versions of Firefox exhibit this problem. I've set both attributes in the examples.A recent comment reminded me of encodings for the data-uri. This was a pain-point for me recently, and I can share a bit of information I've researched.The data-uri spec, which references the URI spec, says that the svg should be encoded according to the URI spec. That means all sorts of characters should be encoded, eg < becomes %3C.Some sources suggest base64 encoding, which should fix encoding issues, however it will unnecessarily increase the size of the SVG, whereas URI encoding will not. I recommend URI encoding.browser-support: >ie8css tricks on svgsmdn on svgsBuilding off @Marc's solution -- since the bullet character is rendered differently with different fonts and browsers, I used the following css3 technique with border-radius to make a bullet that I have more control over:I know this is a really, really, old question but i was playing around with this and came up with a way i have not seen posted. Give the list a color and then overwrite the text color using ::first-line selector. I'm no expert so maybe there is something wrong with this approach that I'm missing, but it seems to work.Building off both @Marc and @jessica solutions - This is the solution that I use:I use em for font sizes so if you set your top value to be .5em it will always be placed to the mid point of your first line of text. I used left:-20px because that is the default position of bullets in browsers: parent  padding/2I really liked Marc's answer too - I needed a set of different colored ULs and obviously it would be easier just to use a class. Here is what I used for orange, for example:Plus, I found that the hex code I used for \"content:\" was different than Marc's (that hex circle seemed to sit a bit too high). The one I used seems to sit perfectly in the middle. I also found several other shapes (squares, triangles, circles, etc.) right hereFor me the best option is to use CSS pseudo elements, so for disc bullet styling it would look like that:\nNotes:For more bullets styles you may use other css shapes https://css-tricks.com/examples/ShapesOfCSS/ (choose this which doesn't require pseudo elements to work, so for example triangles)You can use the ::marker CSS pseudo-element to select the marker box of a list item (i.e. bullets or numbers).Building on @ddilsaver's answer. I wanted to be able to use a sprite for the bullet. This appears to work:I tried this today and typed this:\nI needed to display color markers in my lists (both bullets and numbers). I came upon this tip and wrote in in my stylesheet whith mutualization of the properties:I chose a different character to display a bullet, watching it here. I needed to adjust the margin accoardingly, maybe the values won't apply with the font you chose (the numbers use your webfont).Try using this instead:"},

Having an image covering the whole page behind all other components is probably your best bet (looks like that's the solution given above). Anyway, chances are it will look awful anyway.

And other code that I have tried from various websites doesn't seem to be able to translate to my structure.Thanks for any help!When you float those two divs, the content div collapses to zero height.  Just addafter the #right div but inside the content div.  That will force the content div to surround the two internal, floating divs.This works good for me. I have divided the screen into two halfs: 20% and 80%:Another way to do this is to add overflow:hidden; to the parent element of the floated elements.overflow:hidden will make the element grow to fit in floated elements.This way, it can all be done in css rather than adding another html element.The most flexible way to do this:This acts exactly the same as appending the element to #content:but without actually adding an element. ::after is called a pseudo element. The only reason this is better than adding overflow:hidden; to #content is that you can have absolute positioned child elements overflow and still be visible. Also it will allow box-shadow's to still be visible.For whatever reason I've never liked the clearing approaches, I rely on floats and percentage widths for things like this.Here's something that works in simple cases:If you put some content in you'll see that it works:You can see it here: http://cssdesk.com/d64uyMake children divs inline-block and they will position side by side:See DemoNone of the answers given answer the original question.The question is how to separate a div into 2 columns using css.All of the above answers actually embed 2 divs into a single div in order to simulate 2 columns.  This is a bad idea because you won't be able to flow content into the 2 columns in any dynamic fashion.So, instead of the above, use a single div that is defined to contain 2 columns using CSS as follows...assign the above as a class to a div, and it will actually flow its contents into the 2 columns.  You can go further and define gaps between margins as well.  Depending on the content of the div, you may need to mess with the word break values so your content doesn't get cut up between the columns.Best way to divide a div vertically --I know this post is old, but if any of you still looking for a simpler solution. Floats don't affect the flow. What I tend to do is add aat the end of the 'wrapping div' (in this case content). I can justify this on a semantic basis by saying that such a paragraph might be needed. Another approach is to use a clearfix CSS:The trickery with the comments is for cross-browser compatibility.You can use flexbox to control the layout of your div element:This is best answered here Question 211383These days, any self-respecting person should be using the stated \"micro-clearfix\" approach of clearing floats.*In Safari you may need to set 49% to make it works.Divide a division in two columns is very easy, just specify the width of your column better if you put this (like width:50%) and set the float:left for left column and float:right for right column."},

Can I somehow fix this (remove this transparency in Safari)?Phone and Tablet webkit browsers (Safari and Chrome) and desktop IE have a number of default changes to disabled form elements that you'll need to override if you want to style disabled inputs.it's an interesting question and I've tried plenty of overrides to see if I can get it going, but nothing's working.  Modern browsers actually use their own style sheets to tell elements how to display, so maybe if you can sniff out Chrome's stylesheet you can see what styles they're forcing on to it. I'll be very interested in the result and if you don't have one I'll spend a little time myself looking for it later when I have some time to waste.FYI,doesn't override it, so I'm not sure it's opacity.You could change color to #440000 just for Safari, but IMHO the best solution would be not to change looks of button at all. This way, in every browser on every platform, it will look just like users expect it to.UPDATED 2019:Combining ideas from this page into a \"set and forget\" solution.You can use the readonly attribute instead of the disabled attribute, but then you will need to add a class because there isn't a pseudo-class input:readonly.Beware that a disabled input and readonly input aren't the same.\nA readonly input can have focus, and will send values on submit. Look at w3.orgfor @ryanI wanted my disabled input box to look like a normal one. This is the only thing that would work in Safari Mobile.If you want to fix the problem for all the disabled inputs, you can define -webkit-text-fill-color to currentcolor, so the color property of the input will be used.See that fiddle on Safari\nhttps://jsfiddle.net/u549yk87/3/This question is very old but I thought that I would post an updated webkit solution.\nJust use the following CSS:Can you use a button instead of an input?"},

Also, why are there two display properties? That seems very strange to me. I am especially curious about what the content:'.' means.Thanks,GWhen floating elements exist on the page, non-floating elements wrap around the floating elements, similar to how text goes around a picture in a newspaper. From a document perspective (the original purpose of HTML), this is how floats work.Before the invention of display:inline-block, websites use float to set elements beside each other. float is preferred over display:inline since with the latter, you can't set the element's dimensions (width and height) as well as vertical paddings (top and bottom) - which floated elements can do since they're treated as block elements.The main problem is that we're using float against its intended purpose.Another is that while float allows side-by-side block-level elements, floats do not impart shape to its container. It's like position:absolute, where the element is \"taken out of the layout\". For instance, when an empty container contains a floating 100px x 100px <div>, the <div> will not impart 100px in height to the container.Unlike position:absolute, it affects the content that surrounds it. Content after the floated element will \"wrap\" around the element. It starts by rendering beside it and then below it, like how newspaper text would flow around an image.What clearfix does is to force content after the floats or the container containing the floats to render below it. There are a lot of versions for clear-fix, but it got its name from the version that's commonly being used - the one that uses the CSS property clear.Here are several ways to do clearfix , depending on the browser and use case. One only needs to know how to use the clear property in CSS and how floats render in each browser in order to achieve a perfect cross-browser clear-fix.Your provided style is a form of clearfix with backwards compatibility. I found an article about this clearfix. It turns out, it's an OLD clearfix - still catering the old browsers. There is a newer, cleaner version of it in the article also. Here's the breakdown:All in all, these 3 rules keep the .clearfix working cross-browser, with old browsers in mind.When an element, such as a div is floated, its parent container no longer considers its height, i.e. The parent container will not be be 40 pixels tall by default. This causes a lot of weird little quirks if you're using these containers to structure layout. So the clearfix class that various frameworks use fixes this problem by making the parent container \"acknowledge\" the contained elements. Day to day, I normally just use frameworks such as 960gs, Twitter Bootstrap for laying out and not bothering with the exact mechanics.Can read more herehttp://www.webtoolkit.info/css-clearfix.htmlclearfix is the same as overflow:hidden. Both clear floated children of the parent, but clearfix will not cut off the element which overflow to it's parent.\nIt also works in IE8 & above.There is no need to define \".\" in content & .clearfix.

You can see what I mean by hovering on the shape in the below snippet.How can I create this shape with a slanted side and also be able to support dynamic sizes?There are many ways to create the shape with a slanted edge only on one side. The following methods cannot support dynamic sizes as already mentioned in the question:The methods that can support dynamic sizes are described below.(Browser Compatibility)SVG can be used to produce the shape either by using polygons or paths. The below snippet makes use of polygon. Any text content required can be positioned on top of the shape.Pros Cons (Browser Compatibility)Linear gradients can still be used to produce the shape but not with angles as mentioned in the question. We have to use the to [side] [side] syntax (thanks to vals) instead of specifying angles.  When sides are specified, the gradient angles are automatically adjusted based on the container's dimensions.Pros Cons (Browser Compatibility)In this method, a pseudo-element is added, skewed and positioned in such a way that it looks like one of the edges is slanted/angled.If the top or bottom edge is slanted, the skew should be along Y axis, else the rotation should be along X axis. The transform-origin should have the side opposite to the slanted side.Pros Cons (Browser Compatibility)In this method, the main container is rotated along the X or Y axis with a bit of perspective. Setting the appropriate value to transform-origin would produce a slanted edge on only one side. If the top or bottom side is slanted, the rotation should be along Y axis, else the rotation should be along X axis. The transform-origin should have the side opposite to the slanted side.Pros Cons (Browser Compatibility)In this method, the main container is clipped into the required shape using a polygon. The polygon's points should be modified depending on the side where the slanted edge is required.Pros Cons (Browser Compatibility)Canvas can also be used to produce the shape by drawing paths. The below snippet has a demo. Any text content required can be positioned on top of the shape.Pros Cons * - Avoiding pixelation would need repaints of the shape whenever viewport is resized. There is an example of it here but that is an overhead.(Browser Compatibility)Viewport Units are a great innovation in CSS3. While you can usually use percentage values to dynamize your properties, you can't do it for border-widths (nor for font-sizes). With Viewport Units instead you can dynamically set your border widths, along with the sizes of your objects, compared to the viewport dimension. Note: percentage values are referred to the parent object, not to the viewport (visible area of the window).To test the method, launch the following snippet Full Page and resize it both horizontally and vertically.Pros - (1) Everything is dynamic, browser coverage is wide.Cons - (1) You should pay attention at how your OS handles the scrollbar with overflow: auto;.My solution is inspired by the one called Method 7 - Viewport Units by Andrea Ligios, above in this page.I used the \"horizontal\" unit for the height too (height:10vw) to keep the given proportions in the trapezoid when resizing the width of the navigation window. We could call this Method 7b - Viewport Width.Further, using two nested divs, instead of one and the :after selector, allows a better tuning of the text content styles, in my opinion (e.g. text-align, etc.)."},

Gzip'd binary files will have a smaller file size.Takeaway = There's some advantage to encoding and gzipping your UI icons, etc, but unwise to do this for larger images.It will be bigger in base64.Base64 uses 6 bits per byte to encode data, whereas binary uses 8 bits per byte.  Also, there is a little padding overhead with Base64.  Not all bits are used with Base64 because it was developed in the first place to encode binary data on systems that can only correctly process non-binary data.That means that the encoded image will be around 25% larger, plus constant overhead for the padding.Encoding an image to base64 will make it about 30% bigger.See the details in the wikipedia article about the Data URI scheme, where it states:The answer is: It depends.Although base64-images are larger, there a few conditions where base64 is the better choice.Size of base64-imagesBase64 uses 64 different characters and this is 2^6. So base64 stores 6bit per 8bit character. So the proportion is 6/8 from unconverted data to base64 data. This is no exact calculation, but a rough estimate.Example:An 48kb image needs around 64kb as base64 converted image.Calculation: (48 / 6) * 8 = 64Simple CLI calculator on Linux systems:Or using an image:Base64-images and websitesThis question is much more difficult to answer. Generally speaking, as larger the image as less sense using base64. But consider the following points:It will definitely cost you more space & bandwidth if you want to use base64 encoded images. However if your site has a lot of small images you can decrease the page loading time by encoding your images to base64 and placing them into html. In this way, the client browser wont need to make a lot of connections to the images, but will have them in html."},

Also opens submenu items.Maybe you have to tweak it a bit if your toggle class is different. I am using Angular 5 with Boostrap 4. It works for me in this way.The easiest way to do it using only Angular 2/4 template with no coding:This code simulates a click on the burguer button to close the navbar by clicking on a link in the menu, keeping the fade out effect. Solution with typescript for angular 7. Avoid routerLink problems.this is the solution to close menu when click on anchor then apply this line in list item the real example that work for me is belowu can use a simply bind on click and close, like this: (click)=\"drawer.close()"},

Also see different List-Item markers.http://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_ul.aspYou cannot. Whenever there is any style sheet being applied that assigns a property to an element, there is no way to get to the browser defaults, for any instance of the element.The (disputable) idea of reset.css is to get rid of browser defaults, so that you can start your own styling from a clean desk. No version of reset.css does that completely, but to the extent they do, the author using reset.css is supposed to completely define the rendering.You're resetting the margin on all elements in the second css block. Default margin is 40px - this should solve the problem: An answer for the future: CSS 4 will probably contain the revert keyword, which reverts a property to its value from the user or user-agent stylesheet [source]. As of writing this, only Safari supports this – check here for updates on browser support.In your case you would use:See also this other answer with some more details."},

For example, it will be applied to <div class='container_12 grid_6'> but it will not be applied to the <div class='container_12'>. Is this assumption correct?That says \"make all .grid_6's within .container_12's and all .grid_8's within .container_16's 460 pixels wide.\" So both of the following will render the same:As for the commas, it's applying one rule to multiple classes, like this.It's functionally equivalent to:But cuts down on verbosity.This rule matches a DOM node with class container_12 that has a descendant (not necessarily a child) with class grid_6, and applies the CSS rules to the DOM element with class grid_6.Putting > between them says that the grid_6 node must be a direct child of the node with class container_12.A comma, as others have stated, is a way to apply rules to many different nodes at one time. In this case, the rules apply to any node with either a class of container_12 or grid_6.Not exactly what was asked, but maybe this will help.To apply a style to an element only if it has both classes your selector should use no space between the class names.For Example:Comma groups the classes (applies the same style to them all), an empty space tells that the following selector must be within the first selector.Thereforeapplies that style to only class .grid_6 which is within .container_12 class and to .grid_8 class which is within .container_16.The width: 460px; will be applied to the element with the .grid_8 class, contained inside the elements with .container_16 class, and elements with the .grid_6 class, contained inside the elements with .container_12.The space means heritage, and the comma means 'and'. If you put properties with a selector like\n.class-a, .class-b, you will have the properties applied to the elements with anyone of the two classes.Hope I have helped.  You have four classes and two selectors in your example:So .container_12 and .grid_6 are both classes, but the rule width: 460px will only be applied to elements that have the .grid_6 class which are descendants of an element that have the .container_16 class.For example:The above means that you are applying styles to two classes, indicated by the comma.  When you see two elements side by side not separated you can assume that it is referring to an area within an area.  So in the above, this style only applies to grid_6 classes inside of container_12 classes and grid_8 classes inside of container_16 classes.in the example:The first grid_6 will not be effected while the second grid_6 class will because it is contained inside a container_12.A statement like Would only apply the bold to  tags within areas that have class \"description\" that are inside of an area with id \"admin\", such as:width:460px will be only applied to .grid_6 and .grid_8Edit: Here is a very good article for you http://css-tricks.com/multiple-class-id-selectors/Selectors combinations get different meanings - attached image explains easilya) Multiple selectors separated by a comma(“,”) - Same styles are applied to all selected elements.

Works in IE8+.https://github.com/davidjbradshaw/iframe-resizerThe thing is - there is no other way than using Cross-Domain Messaging for this since you need to get the computed height from a document in one domain, to a document in a different domain.So, either you do this using postMessage (works in all moder browsers), or you spend 5 minutes adapting the resize iframe example from easyXDM. The other party really just needs to copy a few files onto their domain, and add a single line of code to their document..Similar to what Sean has mentioned, you can use postMessage. I've spent so much time trying different ways to resize iframe with cross-domain but no luck until I stumbled on this great blog post by David Walsh: http://davidwalsh.name/window-iframeThis is a combination of my code and David's solution. My solution is geared specifically toward resizing iframes.In the child page, find the height of the page and pass it to the parent page (which contains  the iframe). Replace element_id with your element id (html, body, whatever).On the parent window, add this code. Replace iframe_id with your iframe ID:If you open the console, you will see the height being printed in the console log. This will help you in debugging which is why I left it there. Best,\nBakerHaving looked a lots of different solution to this I ended up writing a simple small library to take a account of a number of different use cases. As I needed a solution that supported multiple user generated iFrames on a portal page, supported browser resizes and could cope with the host page JavaScript loading after the iFrame. I also add support for sizing to width and a callback function and allow the override of the body.margin, as you will likely want to have this set to zero.https://github.com/davidjbradshaw/iframe-resizerThe iframe code is just a little self-contained JavaScript, so that it's a good guest on other people pages.The script is then initialised on the host page with the following available options. Instead of use scroll=no on the iframe, I change it to \"auto\". Then, I get the size of the actual window and use that as the iframe height attribute.Well, the result is...We will never have the \"page\" scroll, only the \"iframe\" scroll. When You navigate, doesn't matter who is the scroll, but the important is that there's only 1.Well, there's the problem of the user simply resize the window while he's navigating. To solve that, I use:Did You think that that solution will cause any bugs? It's working for me, and on the iFrame I had dynamic contect generated by php. I'm afraid of future bugs with that...Nowadays there is only 4 solutions I know:Only the third one can resolve many problems. For example you can create responsive iFrame; close it from inside or you can communicate with it. But to do that you need iFrame in Iframe and the \"third party cookies\" workaround (optional).I've created an article about it with example: Event-driven cross-domain iFrameHave you looked into the 'object-fit' HTML5 attributes? Scales video/images to the iframe, rather than scaling the iframe (nice if you grab a medium-sized image that ends up being 5,000px in width). The \"fit\" option (others are \"cover\" and \"fill\") uses a sort-of-letterbox approach to fit the source in while preserving the aspect ratios. For viewing by the HTML5-less out there, it looks like there a whoooole lot of polyfills available. This one is great, but a bug on Edge's end has kept it incompatible with Microsoft's New Nightmare for about a year, now: https://github.com/anselmh/object-fitEDIT: To get around cross domain issues, you can always just do the work in a Chrome Extension Content Script, since it thinks it's part of the page you're sticking your iframe on.HTTPS another link get height to iframe autoheighthttps://-a.com content:https://-b.com iframe content:Work Table:xcom http > ycom https WORKxcom https > ycom https WORKxcom http > ycom http WORKxcom https > ycom http WORKAre you looking to find the height of the page contained within the iframe? I got some javascript working which checks the height of the iframe content then sets the iframe's height to the height of the content.However, this only works if the page you are showing in the iframe is on the same domain. If it's not you cannot access the required information. Hence, the access denied error.To resize an iframe, here's a simple script:this goes in the head: (this was written for a php script, for html, change the ' to \" and the \\\" to '...end of headthis goes in the body (remember, this was written for a php script, for html change all the ' to \" and the \\\" to '...)bonus: there's some hints above. As it is set for php scripting, you can do a lot with it...to learn more, do more...the key to this is \"sizeframe1\" .... for multiple \"resizers\" on the same page, copy the same script but change the id in iframe and the name in the script in the head, and viola! you have multiple resizers on the same page...it works very well!have phun."},

Although you can use the base CSS declaration trigger an animation when the :hover ends, that same animation will then run on page load.

In other words, if I shrink the window all the way down and then slowly widen it, the layout is single column, then two columns, then back to single column again.[UPDATE BELOW]I took another look at the docs and it appears I overlooked a section which talks specifically about this.The answers to my questions:Other than reading the docs too quickly, I think I was confused because I came into Bootstrap 3 with a \"Bootstrap 2 mentality\". Specifically, I was using the (optional) responsive styles (bootstrap-responsive.css) in v2 and v3 is quite different (for the better IMO).UPDATE for stable release:This question was originally written when RC1 was out. They made some major changes in RC2 so for anyone reading this now, not everything mentioned above still applies.As of when I'm currently writing this, the col-*-# classes DO seem to apply upwards. So for example, if you want an element to be 12 columns (full width) for phones, but two 6 columns (half page) for tablets and up, you would do something like this:(They also added an additional xs break point after this question was written.)Here you have a very good tutorial, that explains, how to use the new grid classes in Bootstrap 3.It also covers mixins etc.To amend SDP's answer above, you do NOT need to declarecol-xs-12 in <div class=\"col-xs-12 col-sm-6\">. Bootstrap 3 is mobile-first, so every div column is assumed to be a 100% width div by default - which means at the \"xs\" size it is 100% width, it will always default to that behavior regardless of what you set at sm, md, lg. If you want your xs columns to be not 100%, then you normally do a col-xs-(1-11).This should be as simple as: No need to add the col-lg-6 too.Demo: http://www.bootply.com/73119The best way to understand is to simply think from top to bottom ( Large Desktops to Mobile Phones) Firstly, as B3 is mobile first so if you use xs then the columns will be same from Large desktops to xs ( i recommend using xs or sm as this will keep everything the way you want on every screen size )Secondly if you want to give different width to columns on different devices or resolutions, than you can add multiple classes e.gthe above will change the width according to the screen resolutions, REMEMBER i am keeping the total columns in each class = 12I hope my answer would help!"},

However, some browsers do not really take these properties into account.This demo gives an overview of what is possible and how it is displayed in various browsers: \nhttps://www.456bereastreet.com/lab/styling-form-controls-revisited/radio-button/As you'll see, styling radio buttons is not easy :-DA workaround is to use JavaScript and CSS to replace the radio buttons and other form elements with custom images:This css seems to do the trick:Setting the border to 0 seems to allow the user to change the size of the button and have the browser render it in that size for eg. the above height: 2em will render the button at twice the line height. This also works for checkboxes (input[type=checkbox]). Some browsers render better than others.From a windows box it works in IE8+, FF21+, Chrome29+.Old question but now there is a simple solution, compatible with most browsers, which is to use CSS3. I tested in IE, Firefox and Chrome and it works.Change the value 1.5, in this case an increment of 50% in size, according to your needs. If the ratio is very high, it can blur the radio button. The next image shows a ratio of 1.5.Not directly. In fact, form elements in general are either problematic or impossible to style using CSS alone. the best approach is to:javascripthtmlYou can control radio button's size with css style:style=\"height:35px; width:35px;\"This directly controls the radio button size.Resizing the default widget doesn’t work in all browsers, but you can make custom radio buttons with JavaScript. One of the ways is to create hidden radio buttons and then place your own images on your page. Clicking on these images changes the images (replaces the clicked image with an image with a radio button in a selected state and replaces the other images with radio buttons in an unselected state) and selects the new radio button.Anyway, there is documentation on this subject. For example, read this: Styling Checkboxes and Radio Buttons with CSS and JavaScript.Here's one approach. By default the radio buttons were about twice as large as labels.\n(See CSS and HTML code at end of answer)Safari: 10.0.3Chrome: 56.0.2924.87Firefox: 50.1.0Internet Explorer: 9 (Fuzziness not IE's fault, hosted test on netrenderer.com)CSS:HTML:Directly you can not do this. [As per my knowledge].You should use images to supplant the radio buttons. You can make them function in the same manner as the radio buttons inmost cases, and you can make them any size you want.You can also use the transform property, with required value in scale:This works fine for me in all browsers:(inline style for simplicity...)The size of both the radio button and text will change with the label's font-size.try this code... it may be the ans what you exactly looking for"},

If you use width: auto, then add border, your div won't become bigger than its container. On the other hand, if you use width: 100% and some border, the element's width will be 100% + border or margin. For more info see this.As long as the value of width is auto, the element can have horizontal margin, padding and border without becoming wider than its container (unless of course the sum of margin-left + border-left-width + padding-left + padding-right + border-right-width + margin-right is larger than the container). The width of its content box will be whatever is left when the margin, padding and border have been subtracted from the container’s width.On the other hand, if you specify width:100%, the element’s total width will be 100% of its containing block plus any horizontal margin, padding and border (unless you’ve used box-sizing:border-box, in which case only margins are added to the 100% to change how its total width is calculated). This may be what you want, but most likely it isn’t.Source:http://www.456bereastreet.com/archive/201112/the_difference_between_widthauto_and_width100/The initial width of a block level element like div or p is auto.Use width:auto to undo explicitly specified widths.if you specify width:100%, the element’s total width will be 100% of its containing block plus any horizontal margin, padding and border.So, next time you find yourself setting the width of a block level element to 100% to make it occupy all available width, consider if what you really want is setting it to auto.Width 100% :\nIt will make content with 100%. margin, border, padding will be added to this width and element will overflow if any of these added.Width auto : \nIt will fit the element in available space including margin, border and padding. space  remaining after adjusting margin + padding + border will be available width/ height.Width 100% + box-sizing: border box :\nIt will also fits the element in available space including border, padding (margin will make it overflow the container).Using width:auto; + display:inline-block; in css giving awesome effect.When we say width will never exceed the total width of parent element. Maximum width is it's parent width. Even if we add border, padding and margin, content of element itself will become smaller in order to give space for border, padding and margin. In case if space required for border + padding + margin is greater than total width of parent element then width of content will become zero.When we saywidth of content of element will become 100% of parent element and from now if we add border, padding or margin then it will cause child element to exceed parent element's width and it will starts overflowing out of parent element."},

You want to put labels on each individual radio group, as shown below.You should keep in mind that two elements should never have the same ID. The name attribute is used so that the radio buttons function as a group and only allow a single selection at a time.There seems to be a little unclickable space between the radio button and the label if done according to Nathan's answer. Here is how to make them join seamlessly (see this article):The label tag should be around each answer, e.g. around Abe, Andrew, etc... and it needs to be unique for each of them.Nesting the input tag within the label tag ensures the label appears right next to the radio button. With the earlier approaches suggested, you can put the label tag anywhere within the html file and it will select the associated radio button when clicked. Check this out:Doing it this way instead eliminates this flaw:You can do it like thisSo if you click on the text or label it selects the radio button.\nBut if you do this...and you add this to what the code I wrote just before this then if you click on the 2nd label then it will also select the radio.I have been doing this for years, but neither of these work for me, using variables.and here is the source:"},

It causes another issue. It will now do the 100% width but it won't be responsive on smaller devices:All these answers introduced another problem by recommending display: table;. The only solution as of right now is to use it as a wrapper:This solution worked for me:just add another class into your table element:\nw-100 d-block d-md-tableso it would be :\n<table class=\"table table-responsive w-100 d-block d-md-table\">for bootstrap 4 w-100 set the width to 100% d-block (display: block) and d-md-table (display: table on min-width: 576px)Bootstrap 4 display docsIf you're using V4.1, and according to their docs, don't assign .table-responsive directly to the table. The table should be .table and if you want it to be horizontally scrollable (responsive) add it inside a .table-responsive container (a <div>, for instance).doing that, no extra css is needed.In the OP's code, .table-responsive can be used alongside with the .col-md-12 on the outside .For some reason the responsive table in particular doesn't behave as it should. You can patch it by getting rid of display:block;I may file a bug report.Edit:It is an existing bug.None of these answers are working (date today 9th Dec 2018). The correct resolution here is to add .table-responsive-sm to your table:This applies the responsiveness aspect only to the SM view (mobile). So in mobile view you get the scrolling as desired and in larger views the table is not responsive and thus displayed full width, as desired.Docs: https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/content/tables/#breakpoint-specificThe solution compliant with the v4 of the framework is to set the proper breakpoint. Rather than using .table-responsive, you should be able to use .table-responsive-sm (to be just responsive on small devices)You can use any of the available endpoints: table-responsive{-sm|-md|-lg|-xl}That's because the .table-responsive class adds the property display: block to your element which changes it from the previous display: table.Override this property back to display: table in your own stylesheet Note: make sure this style executes after your bootstrap code for it to override.It's caused by the table-responsive class giving the table a property of display:block, which is strange because this overwrites the table classes original display:table and is why the table shrinks when you add table-responsive. Most likely its down to bootstrap 4 still being in dev. You are safe to overwrite this property with your own class that sets display:table and it won't effect the responsiveness of the table.e.g.Taking in consideration the other answers I would do something like this, thanks!just wrap table with .table-responsive{-sm|-md|-lg|-xl}for example bootstrap 4 tablesI found that using the recommended table-responsive class in a wrapper still causes responsive tables to (surprisingly) shrink horizontally:The solution for me was to create the following media breakpoints and classes to prevent it:Then I can add the appropriate class to my table element. For example:Here the wrapper sets the width to 100% for large and greater per Bootstrap. With the table-lg class applied to the table element, the table width is set also set to 100% for large and greater, but set to 992px for medium and smaller.

(the span tag)Hello maybe this answer is late but is the correct one to achieve this.Ok the fact is that you must specify an internal tag to make the LIst text be on the usual black (or what ever you want to get it). But is also true that you can REDEFINE any TAGS and internal tags with CSS. So the best way to do this use a SHORTER tag for the redefinitionUsign this CSS definition:And this html code:You get required result. Also you can make each disc diferent color:Just do a bullet in a graphics program and use list-style-image:Wrap the text within the list item with a span (or some other element) and apply the bullet color to the list item and the text color to the span.As per W3C spec, But the idea with a span inside the list above should work fine!You can use Jquery if you have lots of pages and don't need to go and edit the markup your self.here is a simple example:For a 2008 question, I thought I might add a more recent and up-to-date answer on how you could go about changing the colour of bullets in a list.If you are willing to use external libraries, Font Awesome gives you scalable vector icons, and when combined with Bootstrap's helper classes (eg. text-success), you can make some pretty cool and customisable lists.I have expanded on the extract from the Font Awesome list examples page below:Font Awesome (mostly) supports IE8, and only supports IE7 if you use the older version 3.2.1.It works as well if we set color for each elements for example:\nI added some Margin to left now.You could use CSS to attain this.  By specifying the list in the color and style of your choice, you can then also specify the text as a different color.Follow the example at http://www.echoecho.com/csslists.htm.Just use CSS:You'll want to set a \"list-style\" via CSS, and give it a color: value.

This asumes all infowindows are the same size!Short answer: set the maxWidth options property in the constructor. Yes, even if setting the maximum width was not what you wanted to do.Longer story:\nMigrating a v2 map to v3, I saw exactly the problem described. Windows varied in width and height, and some had vertical scrollbars and some didn't. Some had <br /> embedded in the data, but at least one with that sized OK.I didn't think the InfoWindowsOptions.maxWidth property was relevant, since I didn't care to constrain the width... but by setting it with the InfoWindow constructor, I got what I wanted, and the windows now autosize (vertically) and show the full content without a vertical scrollbar. Doesn't make a lot of sense to me, but it works!See: http://fortboise.org/maps/sailing-spots.htmlYou should give the content to InfoWindow from jQuery object.it works for meEDITED (to standout): Trust me, out of the hundred other answers to this question, this is the only correct one that also explains WHY it's happeningOk, so I know this thread is old, and has a thousand answers, but none of them is correct and I feel the need to post the correct answer. Firstly, you do not ever need to specify width's or height's on anything in order to get your infoWindow to display without scrollbars, although sometimes you may accidentally get it working by doing this (but it's will eventually fail).Second, Google Maps API infoWindow's do not have a scrolling bug, it's just very difficult to find the correct information on how they work. Well, here it is:When you tell the Google Maps API to open in infoWindow like this:For all intents and purposes, google maps temporarily places a div at the end of your page (actually it creates a detached DOM tree - but it's conceptually easier to understand if I say you imagine a div being places at the end of your page) with the HTML content that you specified. It then measures that div (which means that, in this example, whatever CSS rules in my document apply to h1 and p tags will be applied to it) to get it's width and height. Google then takes that div, assigns the measurements to it that it got when it was appended to your page, and places it on the map at the location you specified.Here's where the problem happens for a lot of people - they may have HTML that looks like this:and, for whatever reason, CSS that looks like this:Can you see the problem? When the API tries to take the measurements for your infoWindow (immediately before displaying it), the h1 part of the content will have a size of 18px (because the temporary \"measuring div\" is appended to the body), but when the API actually places the infoWindow on the map, the #map-canvas h1 selector will take precedence causing the font size to be much different than what it was when the API measured the size of the infoWindow and in this circumstance you will always get scrollbars.There may be more slightly different nuances for the specific reason why you have scrollbars in your infoWindow, but the reason behind it is because of this:So what I always do, is something like this:and in my CSS:So no matter where the API appends it's measurement div - before the closing body or inside a #map-canvas, the CSS rules applied to it will always be the same.EDIT RE: Font FamiliesGoogle seems to be actively working on the font loading issue (described below) and functionality has changed very recently so you may or may not see the Roboto font load when your infoWindow opens the first time, depending on the version of the API you are using. There is an open bug report (even though in the changelog this bug report was already marked as fixed) that illustrates that google is still having difficulty with this problem. ONE MORE THING: WATCH YOUR FONT FAMILIES!!!In the latest incarnation of the API, google tried to be clever and wrap it's infoWindow content in something that could be targeted with a CSS selector - .gm-style-iw. For people that didn't understand the rules that I explained above, this didn't really help, and in some cases made it even worse. Scrollbars would almost always appear the first time an infoWindow was opened, but if you opened any infoWindow again, even with the exact same content the scrollbars would be gone. Seriously, if you weren't confused before this would make you lose your mind. Here's what was happening:If you look at the styles that google loads on the page when it's API loads, you'll be able to see this:Ok, so Google wanted to make it's maps a bit more consistent by always making them use the Roboto font-family. The problem is, for the majority of people, the before you opened an infoWindow, the browser hadn't yet downloaded the Roboto font (because nothing else on your page used it so the browser is smart enough to know that it doesn't need to download this font). Downloading this font isn't instantaneous, even though it is very fast. The first time you open an infoWindow and the API appends the div with your infoWindow content to the body to take it's measurements, it starts downloading the Roboto font, but your infoWindow's measurements are taken and the window is placed on the map before Roboto finishes downloading. The result, quite often, was an infoWindow whose measurements were taken when it's content was rendered using Arial or a sans-serif font, but when it was displayed on the map (and Roboto had finished downloading) it's content was being displayed in a font that was a different size - and voila - scrollbars appear the first time you open the infoWindow. Open the exact same infoWindow a second time - at which point the Roboto has been downloaded and will be used when the API is taking it's measurements of infoWindow content and you won't see any scrollbars.I tried each one of the answers listed.  None worked for me.\nThis finally fixed it PERMANENTLY.\nThe code I inherited had a DIV wrapper around all the <h#> and <p> entries.  I simply forced some \"style\" in the same DIV, taking into account a desired max width, threw in the line height change just in case (someone else's fix) and my own white-space: nowrap, which then made the auto overflow make the correct adjustments.  No scroll bar, no truncation and no problems!I know this is an old thread, but I just encountered the same problem.  I had <h2> and <p> elements in the InfoWindow, and these both had bottom margins.  I removed the margins, and InfoWindow sized correctly.  None of the other suggested fixes worked.  I suspect that the InfoWindow size calculation doesn't take the margins into account.Going to add my answer to the list, since NONE of these fixed my problem. I ended up wrapping my content in a div, giving that div a class, and specifying the min-width on the div, AND specifying the maxWidth on the infoWindow, AND they both needed to be the same size, otherwise either the width or the height would be overflowing on boxes with just the wrong amount of content.Javascript:CSS:I have tried all of these solutions and none worked.  After some trial and error I figured it out.Set line-height:normal for the map canvas div.It appears that the issue is with the Roboto webfont. The infowindow is rendered with inline width and height properties based on the content provided. However, it is not calculated with the webfont already rendered/loaded. Once the font is rendered AFTER the entire map is printed to the screen, then it causes the scrollbars to appear due to the \"overflow:auto\" properties inline inside the window's DIVs.The solution I found to work is to wrap the content in a DIV and then apply CSS to override the webfont:Funny enough, while the following code will correct the WIDTH scroll bar:It took this to correct the HEIGHT scroll bar:EDIT:\nAdding white-space: nowrap; to either style might correct the spacing issue that seems to linger when the scroll bars are removed. Great point Nathan.This works for me.\nPut a div in the setContentThen add this CSS to your page:For example, see http://www.student-homes-northampton.co.uk; click the links under the house pics to display the Google map.This solved my problem completely:I was having the same problem with IE and tried many of the fixes detailed in these responses, but was unable to remove the vertical scrollbars in IE reliably.  What worked best for me was to switch to fixed font sizes inside the infowindow -- 'px'... I was using ems.  By fixing the font size I no longer needed to explicitly declare the infowindow width or height and the scrollbars were gone for good.  Also important is height of the map container. If to small infoWindow always will be on 80px height. Otherwise maxWidth and #innerDiv fix works like a charm.If nothing else, try adding the content after the window has been opened.  This should force it to resize.Use the domready event and reopen the info window and show the hidden content after the domready event fires twice to ensure all of the dom elements have been loaded. I tried just doing a setTimeout(/* show infowin callback */, 100), but sometimes that didn't work still if the content (ie: images) took too long to load.Hope this works for you.I was having the same issue, particularly noticeable when my <h2> element wrapped to a second line.I applied a class to a <div> in the infoWindow, and changed the fonts to a generic system font (in my case, Helvetica) versus an @font-face web font which it had been using. Issue solved.Add a min-height to your infoWindow class element.That will resolve the issue if your infoWindows are all the same size.If not, add this line of jQuery to your click function for the infoWindow:I couldnt get it to work in any way shape or form, I was including 3 divs into the box. I wrapped them in an outer div, with widths and heights all set correctly, and nothing worked.In the end I fixed it by setting the div as absolute top left, and then before the div, I set two images, one 300px wide and 1px high, one 120px high and 1px wide, of a transparent gif.It scaled properly then!Its ugly but it works.You could also do one image and set a zindex I expect, or even just one image if your window has no interaction, but this was containing a form, so, that wasn't an option...I think that this behavior is because of some css styling in an outer container, I had the same problem but I solved it using an inner div an adding some padding to it, I know it's weird but it solved the problemAnd in my style.cssI had an inline element (an a tag) directly inside of the div with style=\"overflow:auto\"[... wrapped that in a p tag and fixed it.Looks like any inline element that is not nested in a block element directly inside of the infowindow will cause this.My answer is to add a listener (using addListenerOnce) to check if the infoWindow has been added to the DOM, then opening the infoWindow again (no need to close it).Adding the following to my CSS did the trick for me:Just to summarize all the solutions that worked for me in all browsers:I have tested it and it worked on every browser, and I had over 400 markers...I know that lots of other people have found solutions that worked for their particular case, but since none of them worked for my particular case, I thought this might be helpful to someone else.Some details:I'm using google maps API v3 on a project where inline CSS is something we really, really want to avoid. My infowindows were working for everything except for IE11, where the width was not calculated correctly. This resulted in div overflows, which triggered scrollbars.I had to do three things:I don't know why these worked, and I'm not sure if a subset of them would work. I know that none of them work for all of my use cases individually, and that 2 + 3 doesn't work. I didn't have time to test 1 + 2 or 1 + 3.It wasn't acceptable for me to hard code the width and height of the info window, or to set white-space: nowrap, the maxWidth solution didn't help me and everything else either didn't work or was otherwise inappropriate for my use case.My solution was to set the content, open the window and then when the domready event is fired, set the height CSS property on the content to whatever the height is, and then force Google Maps to resize the InfoWindow accordingly.infoWindow is the InfoWindow object, $infoWindowContents is a Jquery object of the contents I want to put in there, map is my Map object. marker is a marker which was clicked.(I posted the same solution over on a similar question How do I get a google-maps InfoWindow to resize to fit the content that is placed inside of it?)After losing time and reading for a while, I just wanted something simple, this css worked for my requirements.Also is not an instant solution but starring/commenting on the issue might make them fix it, as they believe it is fixed:\nhttp://code.google.com/p/gmaps-api-issues/issues/detail?id=5713Well this is the one that did the trick for me:Only setting overflow: visible on .gm-style-iw actually made the problem worse! I noticed in the Chrome developer tools inspector that there are two divs inside the .gm-style-iw element, both which have overflow: auto set by default. I'm displaying quite a lot of HTML-formatted text in my InfoWindows, that might be why the other solutions didn't work at all for me."},

Thanks for the lesson!-webkit-transform: translate3d(0,0,0); makes some devices run their hardware acceleration.A good read is found HereUsing -webkit-transform: translate3d(0,0,0); will kick the GPU into action for the CSS transitions, making them smoother (higher FPS).Note: translate3d(0,0,0) does nothing in terms of what you see. it moves the object by 0px in x, y and z axis. It's only a technique to force the hardware acceleration.An alternative is -webkit-transform: translateZ(0). And If there's flickering on Chrome and Safari due to transforms, try -webkit-backface-visibility: hidden and -webkit-perspective: 1000. For more info refer to this article.I didn't see an answer here that explains this. Lots of transformations can be done by calculating each of the div and its options using a complicated set of validation. However, if you use a 3D function, each of the 2D elements you have are considered as 3D elements and we can perform a matrix transformation on these elements on the fly. However, most of the the elements are \"technically\" already hardware accelerated because they all use the GPU. But, the 3D transforms work directly on the cached versions of each of these 2D renders (or cached versions of the div) and directly use a matrix transformation on them (which are vectorized and parallelized FP math).It is important to note that 3D transforms ONLY makes changes to features on a cached 2D div (in other words, the div is already a rendered image). So, things like changing the border width and color are no longer \"3D\" to be vaguely speaking. If you think about it, changing the border widths require you to rerender the div because and recache it so that the 3D transforms can be applied.Hope this makes sense and let me know if you have any more questions.To answer your quesetion, translate3d: 0x 0y 0z would do nothing since the transforms work directly on the texture that is formed by running the vertices of the div into the GPU shader. This shader resource is now cached and a matrix will be applied when drawing onto the frame buffer. So, basically there is no benefit from doing that.This is how the browser works internally.Step 1: Parse InputStep 2: Develop Composite LayerStep 3: Render Composite LayerThere's a bug with scrolling in MobileSafary (iOS 5) which leads to appearing artifacts as copies of input elements in the scrolling container.Using translate3d for each child element can fix that odd bug.\nHere's an example of CSS which saved the day for me.Translate3D forces hardware acceleration.CSS animations, transforms and transitions are not automatically GPU accelerated, and instead execute from the browser’s slower software rendering engine.In order to use GPU we use translate3dCurrently, browsers like Chrome, FireFox, Safari, IE9+ and the latest version of Opera all come with hardware acceleration, they only use it when they have an indication that a DOM element would benefit from it. Be aware that it creates a stacking context  (plus what the other answers said), so it does potentially have an effect on what you see, e.g. making something appear over an overlay when it isn't supposed to."},

Stephen makes good points, however, his discussion seems inconclusive to me.So my question is: What value does the 'ex' unit lend to web design?(This question could be tagged subjective, but I'll leave that decision to more experienced SO'ers than myself.)It is useful when you want to size something in relation to the height of your text's lowercase letters. For example, imagine working on a design like so: \n\nIn the typographic dimension of design, the height of letters has important spatial relationships to the rest of the elements. The lines in the source image above are intended to help point out the x-height of the text, but they also show where guidelines would be if designing around that text.As Jonathan pointed out in the comments, ex is simply the height version of em (width).To answer the question, one use is with superscript and subscript. Example:Another thing to consider here is how your page scales when a user ups or downs their font size (perhaps using ctrl+mouse wheel (windows)).I have used em with..\npadding-left: 2 em;\npadding-right: 2 em;and ex with\npadding-bottom: 2 ex;\npadding-top: 2 ex;Thus using a vertical unit of measure for a vertically scaling property and a horizontal unit of measure for a horizontally scaling property.The value of having it in the CSS spec, if that's what you're really asking, is exactly the same as the value of having the em unit.It enables you to set fonts to relative sizes.You don't know what my base font size is. So one good strategy for web design is to set font sizes which are relative, rather than absolute; the equivalent of \"double your normal size\" or \"a little smaller than your normal size\" rather than a fixed size like \"ten pixels\".Note that, terms like \"single/double line spacing\" actually mean the offset between two adjacent lines, measured by em. So \"double line spacing\" means each line has a height of 2 em.Therefore, if you want to specify a vertical distance that is proportional to \"lines\", use em. Only use ex if you want the actual height of lowercase letter, which is, I dare say, a much rarer instance."},

CSS is well supportedand Javascript (read: JScript) is now pretty much required for any web experience, and few folks disable javascript.The original answer, as my opinion in 2009.Off the top of my head: With CSS, you may have issues with browser support. With JScript, people can disable jscript (thats what I do).I believe the preferred method is to do content in HTML, Layout with CSS, and anything dynamic in JScript. So in this instance, you would probably want to take the CSS approach.There is another difference to keep in mind between the two. With CSS, the :hover state is always deactivated when the mouse moves off an element. However, with JavaScript, the onmouseout event is not fired when the mouse moves off the element onto browser chrome rather than onto the rest of the page.This happens more often than you might think, especially when you're making a navbar at the top of your page with custom hover states.A very big difference is that \":hover\" state is automatically deactivated when the mouse moves out of the element. As a result any styles that are applied on hover are automatically reversed.\nOn the other hand, with the javascript approach, you would have to define both \"onmouseover\" and \"onmouseout\" events. If you only define \"onmouseover\" the styles that are applied \"onmouseover\" will persist even after you mouse out unless you have explicitly defined \"onmouseout\".In Internet Explorer, there must be declared a <!DOCTYPE> for the :hover selector to work on other elements than the <a> element.Use CSS, it makes for much easier management of the style itself.In reguards to using jQuery to do hover, I always use the plugin HoverIntent as it doesn't fire the event until you pause over an element for brief period of time... this stops firing off lots of mouse over events if you accidentally run the mouse over them or simply whilst choosing an option.If you don't need 100% support for IE6 with javascript disabled you could use something like ie7-js with IE conditional comments. Then you just use css rules to apply hover effects. I don't know exactly how it works but it uses javascript to make a lot of css rules work that don't normally in IE7 and 8."},

They are displayed in the page where they rendered as part of normal HTML flow. Statically positioned elements don't obey left, top, right and bottom rules:Relative positioning allows you to specify a specific offset (left, top etc) which is relative to the element's normal position in HTML flow. So if I have a textbox inside a div I could apply relative positioning on the textbox to have it display at specific place relative to where it would normally be placed within the div:There is also absolute positioning - whereby you specify the exact location of the element relative to the entire document, or the next relatively positioned element further up the element tree: And when a position: relative is applied to a parent element in the hierarchy:Note how our absolutely-position element is bound by the relatively-positioned element.And lastly there is fixed. Fixed positioning restricts an element to a specific position in the viewport, which stays in place during scroll:You may also observe the behaviour that fixed-positioned elements do not cause scroll because they are not considered to be bound by the viewport:Whereas absolutely-positioned elements are still bound by the viewport and will cause scrolling:..unless of course your parent element uses overflow: ? to determine the behaviour of the scroll (if any).With absolute positioning and fixed positioning, the elements are taken out of HTML flow.You can see a simple overview here: W3SchoolAlso, if I recall correctly, when declaring an element relative, it will by default stay in the same place as it otherwise should, but you gain the ability to absolutely position elements inside it relatively to this element, which I've found very useful in the past.In answer to \"why CSS would still implement position: static;\" in one scenerio, using position:relative for a parent and position:absolute for the child limits the scaling width of the child. In a horizontal menu system, where you could have 'columns' of links, using 'width:auto' does not work with relative parents. In this case, changing it to 'static' will allow the width to be variable dependent on the content within.I spent a good few hours wondering why I couldn't get my container to adjust based on the amount of content within it. Hope this helps!Position relative lets you use top/bottom/left/right for positioning. Static won't let you do this unless you use margin parameters. There's a difference between Top and margin-top.You won't need to use static much as it's defaultRelative position is relative to the normal flow. The relative position of that element (with offsets) is relative to the position where that element would have been normally if not moved.Matthew Abbott has a really good answer. Absolute and relative positioned items obey top, left, right and bottom commands (offsets) where static positioned items do not. Relatively positioned items move offsets from where they would normally be in the html. Absolute positioned items move offsets from the document or the next relatively positioned element up the DOM tree.Static :  A STATIC positioned element is what are we get by DEFAULT (Normal positioning of objects).Relative :  Relative to it’s current position, but can be moved.\nOr A RELATIVE positioned element is positioned relative to ITSELF.static and relative are position attributes.relative is used for many uses. Not for one.\nBut keep in mind that static and relative don't harm to normal document flow of the Html.\nstatic is the default position that when you write any element to Html.\n If an element has a relative position, that element can be positioned relative to its native place. when you want to adjust element from small spaces, use the relative position so that you don't need to add the margin, padding e.t.c\n   if the element has a position relative and it has a child element. Here we can do measurements relatively to its parent. If you add width 10% to the child, that means (width+padding)x10%.but you don't add the relative keyword, you get widthx10%.\n      Other than that, the most important usage of the relative is;\nyou can position any element top of it.but you have to use \"absolute\" keyword to child.when adding absolute keyword to the child, the child is out of the normal document flow"},

Thanks in advance for your time, it's much appreciated.\nRegardsInstead of using background-image you can use img directly and to get the image to spread all the width of the viewport try using max-width:100%; and please remember don't apply any padding or margin to your main container div as they will increase the total width of the container. Using this rule you can have a image width equal to the width of the browser and the height will also change according to the aspect ratio. Thanks.Edit: Changing the image on different size of the windowIn this way you change your image in different size of the browser.Tim S. was much closer to a \"correct\" answer then the currently accepted one. If you want to have a 100% width, variable height background image done with CSS, instead of using cover (which will allow the image to extend out from the sides) or contain (which does not allow the image to extend out at all), just set the CSS like so:This will set your background image to 100% width and allow the height to overflow. Now you can use media queries to swap out that image instead of relying on JavaScript.EDIT: I just realized (3 months later) that you probably don't want the image to overflow; you seem to want the container element to resize based on it's background-image (to preserve it's aspect ratio), which is not possible with CSS as far as I know.Hopefully soon you'll be able to use the new srcset attribute on the img element. If you want to use img elements now, the currently accepted answer is probably best.However, you can create a responsive background-image element with a constant aspect ratio using purely CSS. To do this, you set the height to 0 and set the padding-bottom to a percentage of the element's own width, like so:In order to use different aspect ratios, divide the height of the original image by it's own width, and multiply by 100 to get the percentage value. This works because padding percentage is always calculated based on width, even if it's vertical padding.Try this Simplified versionYou can use the CSS property background-size and set it to cover or contain, depending your preference. Cover will cover the window entirely, while contain will make one side fit the window thus not covering the entire page (unless the aspect ratio of the screen is equal to the image).Please note that this is a CSS3 property. In older browsers, this property is ignored. Alternatively, you can use javascript to change the CSS settings depending on the window size, but this isn't preferred.Just use a two color background image:Add the css:And html is:CSS: stretching background image to 100% width and height of screen?It's 2017, and now you can use object-fit which has decent support. It works in the same way as a div's background-size but on the element itself, and on any element including images."},

Still under consideration for IE. Or you can use simply preload=\"none\" attribute to make VIDEO background visible. And you can use background-size: cover; here.I was playing around with this and tried all solutions, eventually the solution I went with was a suggestion from Google Chrome's Inspector. If you add this to your CSS it worked for me:My solution combines user2428118 and Veiko Jääger's answers, allowing for preloading but without requiring a separate transparent image. We use a base64 encoded 1px transparent image instead.I came up with this idea and it works perfectly. Okay so basically we want to get rid of the videos first frame from the display and then resize the poster to the videos actual size. If we then set the dimensions we have completed one of these tasks. Then only one remains. So now, the only way I know to get rid of the first frame is to actually define a poster. However we are going to give the video a faked one, one that doesn't exist. This will result in a blank display with the background transparent. I.e. our parent div's background will be visible.Simple to use, however it might not work with all web browsers if you want to resize the dimension of the background of the div to the dimension of the video since my code is using \"background-size\".HTML/HTML5:CSS:CoverFill\nI had a similar issue and just fixed it by creating an image with the same aspect ratio as my video (16:9).  My width is set to 100% on the video tag and now the image (320 x 180) fits perfectly.  Hope that helps!You can resize image size after generating thumbYou can use poster to show image instead of video on mobile device(or devices which doesn't support the video autoplay functionality). Because mobile devices not support video autoplay functionality.Now you can just style the poster attribute which is inside the video tag for mobile device via media-query.This workedAnd the CSS"},

However you can override this with the word-wrap CSS directive.You would need to set a width on the overall table then a width on the columns. \"width:100%;\" should also be OK depending on your requirements.Using word-wrap may not be what you want however it is useful for showing all of the data without deforming the layout.Make the table rock solid BEFORE the css. Figure your width of the table, then use a 'controlling' row whereby each td has an explicit width, all of which add up to the width in the table tag.Having to do hundreds html emails to work everywhere, using the correct HTML first, then styling w/css will work around many issues in all IE's, webkit's and mozillas.so:Will keep a table at 300px wide.

It should work as you expected.Then the css.You can also work with \"overflow: hidden\" or \"overflow-x: hidden\" (for just the width). This requires a defined width (and/or height?) and maybe a \"display: block\" as well. \"Overflow:Hidden\" hides the whole content, which does not fit into the defined box.Example:http://jsfiddle.net/NAJvp/HTML:CSS:EDIT: Shame on me, I've seen, you already use \"overflow\". I guess it doesn't work, because you don't set \"display: block\" to your element ...I would try setting it to max-width:50px;You can also use percentages, and/or specify in the column headers:The bonus with percentages is lower code maintenance: you can change your table width without having to re-specify the column widths.Caveat:  It is my understanding that table width specified in pixels isn't supported in HTML 5; you need to use CSS instead.This works for me"},

Hats off to Firefox for being awesome for web developing! Heads up, not only will the website now be boosted to twice the size, the Firefox UI will also be doubled. This doubling or zooming is necessary, as that's the only way you'll be able to examine all the pixels on a standard pixel ratio screen.This works fine on Windows 7 with Firefox 21.0, and also on Mac OS X with Firefox 27.0.1.If you're not using media queries and other more advanced logic (i.e. you're feeding everyone the HiDPI images), you can just zoom in with your browser to 200%. The Chrome emulation is a helpful tool as well as it kicks in media queries, but because it prevents zooming, you can't examine image quality.Zooming on Firefox & EdgeCurrently on Firefox and Edge, if you zoom it triggers dppx-based media queries. So this easier approach may be sufficient, but be aware that the functionality is reported as a \"won't fix\" bug for Firefox, so this could change.In Google Chrome version \"33.0.1720.0 Canary\", you can now emulate devices like iPhone5 and others with a great set of parameters like \"Device pixel ratio\", \"android font metrics\" and \"Viewport emulation\".There's no need for that Firefox hack anymore - hard to work with, anyway.Thanks Google dev team!  !:) In chrome you can do it by:1) Open up Chrome Developer Tools and click on the little \"gear\" icon.\n2) Then choose \"Show 'Emulation' view in console drawer.\"\n3) Finally, open up the \"console drawer\" in Developer Tools, and choose Emulation.

Experience tells me that these two lines always improve performances, especially on iPad but also on Chrome.I did test on your exemple and, as far as I can tell, it works.As for the \"why\" part of your question... I don't know. 3D transform are a young standard, so implementation is choppy. That's why it's a prefixed property : for beta testing. Someone could fill a bug report or a question and have the team investigate.Edit per August 19th 2013:There's regular activity on this answer, and I just lost an hour finding that IE10 also need this.\nSo don't forget :The reason animation was slower when you added the null transform hack (translateZ(0)) is that each null 3D transform creates a new layer. When there are too many of these layers, rendering performance suffers because the browser needs to send a lot of textures to the GPU.The problem was noticed in 2013 on Apple's homepage, which abused the null transform hack. See http://wesleyhales.com/blog/2013/10/26/Jank-Busting-Apples-Home-Page/The OP also correctly noticed the explanation in their comment: Interesting. I've tried playing with a few options in about:flags, specifically these ones:Enabled those, tried it and failed miserably with the tickbox enabled (just like you did). But then I noticed yet another option:Given the highlight in the flag description, I'd speculate that hardware acceleration was, in fact, on for me even without the ticked checkbox since I saw the FPS counter with the options above turned on!TL;DR: hardware acceleration is, in the end, a user preference; forcing it with dummy translateZ(0) will introduce redundant processing overhead giving the appearance of lower performance.Check chrome://flags in chrome. It says My expericence is that GPUs aren't generally faster for all kind of graphics. For very \"basic\" graphics they can be slower.You might have gotten different result if you were rotating an image - that's the kind of thing GPUs are good atAlso consider that translateZ(0) is an operation in 3 dimensions, while changing top or left is a 2 dimensional operationI saw you two demo， I think I know the reason you confused：Above, only a personal opinion, thank you!"},

Leaving for historical context. In fact that bug report links back to this question for alternative solutions to using this.Seems I managed to answer my own question after another hour of research.It's as simple as this:(Works in WebKit/Chrome, possibly others too)Have a look at this library, which does what was asked for:  http://www.brothercake.com/site/resources/scripts/cssutilities/It works in all modern browsers right back to IE6, can give you rule and property collections like Firebug (in fact it's more accurate than Firebug), and can also calculate the relative or absolute specificity of any rule. The only caveat is that, although it understands static media types, it doesn't understand media-queries.Challenger appears.Line /* 1 */ builds a flat array of all rules.\nLine /* 2 */ discards non-matching rules.Based on function css(el) by @S.B. on the same page.Maybe I will address these shortcomings one day.Here’s a much more comprehensive implementation taken from someone’s GitHub page\n(forked from this original code, via Bugzilla). Written for Gecko and IE, but is rumoured to work also with Blink.4 May 2017: The specificity calculator has had critical bugs which I have now fixed. (I can’t notify the authors because I don’t have a GitHub account.)12 August 2018: Recent Chrome updates seem to have decoupled object scope (this) from methods assigned to independent variables. Therefore invocation matcher(selector) has stopped working. Replacing it by matcher.call(el, selector) has solved it.Here's a version of S.B.'s answer which also returns matching rules within matching media queries. I've removed the *.rules || *.cssRules coalescence and the .matches implementation finder; add a polyfill or add those lines back in if you need them.This version also returns the CSSStyleRule objects rather than the rule text. I think this is a little more useful, since the specifics of the rules can be more easily probed programmatically this way.Coffee:JS:Here is my version of getMatchedCSSRules function which support @media query.I think the answer from S.B. should be the accepted one at this point but it is not exact. It is mentioned a few times that there will be some rules that may be missed. Faced with that, I decided to use document.querySelectorAll instead of element.matches. The only thing is that you would need some kind of unique identification of elements to compare it to the one you are looking for. In most cases I think that is achievable by setting its id to have a unique value. That's how you can identify the matched element being yours. If you can think of a general way to match the result of document.querySelectorAll to the element you are looking for that would essentially be a complete polyfill of getMatchedCSSRules. I checked the performance for document.querySelectorAll since it probably is slower than element.matches but in most cases it should not be a problem. I see that it takes about 0.001 milliseconds. I also found CSSUtilities library that advertises that it can do this but I feel its old and has not been updated in a while. Looking at its source code, it makes me think there may be cases that it misses.Ensuring IE9+, I wrote a function which calculates CSS for requested element and its children, and gives possibility to save it to a new className if needed in snippet below.Usage"},

In col-xx-#, # is the number of columns you cover and offset is the number of columns you leave. For xx, in a general website, md is preferred and if you want your layout to look the same in a mobile device, xs is preferred.With what I can make of your requirement,Should do the trick.Alternate Bootstrap 4 solution (this way you can use divs which are smaller than col-6):MoreTo align two divs horizontally you just have to combine two classes of Bootstrap:\nHere's how:This does the trick.The response provided by Ranveer (second answer above) absolutely does NOT work. He says to use col-xx-offset-#, but that is not how offsets are used. If you wasted your time trying to use col-xx-offset-#, as I did based on his answer, the solution is to use offset-xx-#.Alternative which I did programming Angular: I recommend css grid over bootstrap if what you really want, is to have more structured data, e.g. a side by side table with multiple rows, because you don't have to add class name for every child:css-grid"},

To properly use npm scripts as an alternative to gulp read this comprehensive article @ css-tricks.com especially read about grouping tasks.A basic example to transpileAdd this code to your gulpfile.js:$ gulp sass runs the above task which compiles .scss file(s) in the sass folder and generates .css file(s) in the css folder.To make life easier, let's add a watch so we don't have to compile it manually. Add this code to your gulpfile.js:All is set now! Just run the watch task:As the name of node-sass implies, you can write your own node.js scripts for transpiling. If you are curious, check out node-sass project page.Libsass is a library that needs to be built by an implementer such as sassC or in our case node-sass. Node-sass contains a built version of libsass which it uses by default. If the build file doesn't work on your machine, it tries to build libsass for your machine. This process requires Python 2.7.x (3.x doesn't work as of today). In addition:The installation of these tools may vary on different OS.Under Windows, node-sass currently supports VS2015 by default, if you only have VS2013 in your box and meet any error while running the command, you can define the version of VS by adding: --msvs_version=2013. This is noted on the node-sass npm page.So, the safe command line that works on Windows with VS2013 is:\nnpm install --msvs_version=2013 gulp node-sass gulp-sassIn Windows 10 using node v6.11.2 and npm v3.10.10, in order to execute directly in any folder:I only followed the instructions in node-sass Github:Close the previous shell and reopen a new one and run either > node-gyp or > node-sass.Note:"},

Prefer to use the style tag, in this case, because it:Inline elements only affect their respective element.An important difference between the style tag and the inline attribute is specificity.  Specificity determines when one style overrides another. Generally, inline styles have a higher specificity. Read CSS: Specificity Wars for an entertaining look at this subject.I hope that helps!Here's one aspect that could rule the difference:If you change an element's style in JavaScript, you are affecting the inline style. If there's already a style there, you overwrite it permanently. But, if the style were defined in an external sheet or in a <style> tag, then setting the inline one to \"\" restores the style from that source.It depends.The main point is to avoid repeated code.If the same code need to be re-used 2 times or more, and should be in sync when change, use external style sheet.If you only use it once, I think inline is ok.To answer your direct question: neither of these is the preferred method. Use a separate file.Inline styles should only be used as a last resort, or set by Javascript code. Inline styles have the highest level of specificity, so override your actual stylesheets. This can make them hard to control (you should avoid !important as well for the same reason).An embedded <style> block is not recommended, because you lose the browser's ability to cache the stylesheet across multiple pages on your site.So in short, wherever possible, you should put your styles into a separate CSS file.From a maintainability standpoint, it's much simpler to manage one item in one file, than it is to manage multiple items in possibly multiple files.  Separating your styling will help make your life much easier, especially when job duties are distributed amongst different individuals.  Reusability and portability will save you plenty of time down the road.When using an inline style, that will override any external properties that are set.I agree with the majority view that external stylesheets are the prefered method.However, here are some practical exceptions:Whenever is possible is preferable to use class .myclass{} and identifier #myclass{}, so use a dedicated css file or tag <style></style> within an html.\nInline style is good to change css option dynamically with javascript.There can be different reasons for choosing one way over the other.Otherwise, as stated, it is better to use a separate css file.You can set CSS using three different ways as mentioned below :-Preferred / ideal way of setting the css style is using as external style sheets when the style is applied to many pages. \nWith an external style sheet, you can change the look of an entire Web site by changing one file.sample usage can be :-If you want to apply a unique style to a single document then you can use Internal style sheet.  Don't use inline style sheet,as it mixes content with presentation and looses many advantages. "},

The latter is used to completely hide everything else.Long version: visibility: collapse hides an element entirely (so that it doesn't occupy any space in the layout), but only when the element is a table element.If used on elements other than table elements, visibility: collapse will act like visibility: hidden. This makes an element invisible, but it will still occupy space in the layout.display: none hides an element entirely, so it doesn't occupy any space in the layout, but it shouldn't be used on table elements.W3C Referencevisibility: collapse behaves exactly like visibility: hidden in most formatting contexts: the space required by the element is 'reserved' in the layout, but the element itself is not rendered, leaving a blank space where it would have been.There are three exceptions that I know of: table-rows, table-columns and flex items, in which visibility: collapse behaves like display: none, but with one major difference: the 'strut'. You can think of the strut as a zero-sized placeholder, that doesn't claim any space of its own in the layout process, but is nevertheless still part of the formatting structure and participates in some size computations.A collapsed table-row, for example, will not occupy any vertical space in the table, but the table columns will still be dimensioned 'as-if' the collapsed row and its contents were actually visible. This is to prevent columns from 'wobbling' as rows are toggled in and out. Likewise, a collapsed flex item doesn't occupy any space along the main axis, but still contributes to the flex line cross-size.'Do not use display: none with tables' is a valuable rule of thumb, but it doesn't tell the whole story. Here is a code snippet demonstrating the difference between display: none and visibility: collapse for a table row:visibility:collapse should only be used on tables. On other elements it will act as a visibility:hidden.visibility:hidden hide the element but still take the space of the element whereas display:none won't even keep the space.Resources :On the same topic :visibility:collapse has a display:none behavior only for table elements. On other elements, it should render as hidden.You can also apply visibility: collapse on an element under a flexbox container (a flex item). It will act as you're applying it on an element with display: table-row or display: table-column"},

I don't think you should use a form tag as others suggest as it's not a form at all.http://learnangular2.com/events/EVENT OBJECTTo capture the event object, pass $event as a parameter in the event callback from the template:This is an easy way to modify the event, such as calling preventDefault:"},

Besides, if the floating box appears earlier in the markup, then it will display what I think it should be.How can we explain this? Can we use \"block formatting context and inline formatting context\" to explain it?Block Formatting ContextsWith my bold, it's the establish bit that is importantWhat this means is that the element you use overflow (anything other than visible) or float or inline-block..etc on becomes responsible for the layout of its child elements. It's the child elements which are then \"contained\", whether that's floats or collapsing margins they should be wholly contained by their bounding  parent. What the above line means:Because a box can only be rectangular and not irregular shaped this means a new block formatting context between two floats (or even beside one) will not wrap around neighbouring side floats. The inner, child boxes can only extend as far as to touch their parents left (or right in RTL) edge. It's this behaviour that's useful for columnar style layouts. The main use of it however is to stop floats, say in a \"main content\" div, actually clearing floated side columns, i.e. floats that appear earlier in the source code.Float ClearanceIn normal circumstances floats are supposed to clear all previous floated elements, that's previously floated in the whole source code, not just your displayed \"column\"\nThe telling quote from the \"float clearance specs\" is:So say you have a three column layout where the left and right columns are floated left and right respectively, the side columns are now in new Block Formatting Contexts, because they are floated (remember float is also one of the properties that establish a new BFC), so you can happily float list elements inside them and they only clear floats which are already inside the side columns they no longer care about floats previously in the source codeNow that middle column, you can simply margin it from both sides so that it appears to sit neatly between the two side floated columns and take the remaining width, a common way to get desired width if the centre column is \"fluid\" - which will be fine until you need to use floats/clearance inside your content div (a common occurrence for those using \"clearfix\" hacks or templates including them)Take this very simple code:It produces the following:In general this is fine, especially if you have no background colours or internal (in the main content) floats -  notice the floats are fine (not cleared yet) they're doing probably what you except them to but they, the H3's top margin and the p's bottom margin are not actually really contained by the content div (lightgrey background). So to the same simple margined scenario of above code add:to the CSS, and change the second HTML floated box to:This time you get this:The second float is clearing the right side but it's clearing the whole height of the right column. The right column is floated earlier in the source code so it's clearing it as told! Probably not the desired effect though, also note the h3 and p margins are still collapsed (not contained).and finally make the main content column take responsibility - become a Block Formatting Context - for its contents : remove margin: 0 200px; from the main content CSS and ADD overflow: hidden; and you get this:This is probably much more like what you would expect to happen, note now the floats are contained, they clear properly ignoring the right side column, and also the h3 and p margins are contained instead of collapsed.With the extensive use of resets these days the margins are less noticeable (and IE still doesn't get them quite right) however what just happened to the centre \"main content\" is that it became a Block Formatting Context and is now responsible for its own child (descendant) elements. It's actually very similar to Microsoft's early days notion of hasLayout, it uses the same properties display: inline-block, float, and overflow anything other than visible, and of course table cells always have layout.. it is however without the bugs ;)Hope that helps a bit, any questions feel free to ask!When you say \"but floating elements are ignored when user agent draws box and take them into account when they fill out content.\" Yes floats normally overlay their container boxes, is that what you mean about parent boundaries? When a block element is drawn and it contains a float the block parent itself is drawn as a rectangle under the float and it is the \"inline anonymous boxes\" or simply \"line boxes\" of the other child elements that are shortened to make room for the floatTake this code:Which produces this:You see that the parent element doesn't actually contain the float, as in it doesn't wrap it entirely.. the float is simply floating on top of the content - if you were to keep adding content to the div it would eventually wrap underneath the float because there would be no need for the (anonymous) \"line boxes\" of the p element to shorten themselves any more. I've coloured the paragraph element so you can see that it too actually goes under the float, the darkgray background is where the paragraph starts, the white text is where the \"anonymous line box\" starts - it's only actually them that \"make room\" for the float, unless you tell it otherwise (i.e. you change the context)Again referring to the above picture, if you were to margin the left side of thep element, yes it will stop the text wrapping under the bottom of the float because the \"line boxes\" (the white text) will only touch the left edge of their container, and you will bring the coloured background of the p to the right, clear of the float, but you won't have changed the behaviour of the p's formatting context. Like the centre column in the first picture way above ;)"},

You can do something like this:You can read more about the step-callback here: http://api.jquery.com/animate/#stephttp://jsfiddle.net/UB2XR/23/And, btw: you don't need to prefix css3 transforms with jQuery 1.7+You can wrap this in a jQuery-plugin to make your life a bit easier:http://jsbin.com/ofagog/2/editI optimized it a bit to make the order of easing, duration and complete insignificant.Thanks to matteo who noted an issue with the this-context in the complete-callback. If fixed it by binding the callback with jQuery.proxy on each node.I've added the edition to the code before from Update 2.This is a possible modification if you want to do something like toggle the rotation back and forth. I simply added a start parameter to the function and replaced this line:If anyone knows how to make this more generic for all use cases, whether or not they want to set a start degree, please make the appropriate edit.Mainly you've two ways to reach the desired result. But at the first, let's take a look on the arguments:jQuery.fn.animateRotate(angle, duration, easing, complete)Except of \"angle\" are all of them optional and fallback to the default jQuery.fn.animate-properties:This way is the short one, but looks a bit unclear the more arguments we pass in.I prefer to use objects if there are more than three arguments, so this syntax is my favorit:Thanks yckart! Great contribution. I fleshed out your plugin a bit more. Added startAngle for full control and cross-browser css.jQuery transit will probably make your life easier if you are dealing with CSS3 animations through jQuery.EDIT March 2014 \n(because my advice has constantly been up and down voted since I posted it)Let me explain why I was initially hinting towards the plugin above:Updating the DOM on each step (i.e. $.animate ) is not ideal in terms of performance. \nIt works, but will most probably be slower than pure CSS3 transitions or CSS3 animations. This is mainly because the browser gets a chance to think ahead if you indicate what the transition is going to look like from start to end.To do so, you can for example create a CSS class for each state of the transition and only use jQuery to toggle the animation state. This is generally quite neat as you can tweak you animations alongside the rest of your CSS instead of mixing it up with your business logic:If any of the transform parameters is dynamic you can of course use the style attribute instead:A lot more detailed information on CSS3 transitions on MDN. HOWEVER There are a few other things to keep in mind and all this can get a bit tricky if you have complex animations, chaining etc. and jQuery Transit just does all the tricky bits under the hood:To do this cross browser including IE7+, you will need to expand the plugin with a transformation matrix. Since vendor prefix is done in jQuery from jquery-1.8+ I will leave that out for the transform property.Note: The parameters options and startAngle are optional, if you only need to set startAngle use {} or null for options.Example usage:See also this jsfiddle for a demo.Update: You can now also pass extra: {} in the options. This will make you able to execute other animations simultaneously. For example:This will rotate the element 90 degrees, and move it to the right with 100px and make it semi-transparent all at the same time during the animation.this is my solution:then you can use it in the default animate fkt:Another answer, because jQuery.transit is not compatible with jQuery.easing. This solution comes as an jQuery extension. Is more generic, rotation is a specific case:The usage is as simple as:Without plugin cross browser with setInterval:"},

Thank you for asking it. The great thing is the fact that:Original Fiddle Used (modified in later edit to fiddle link above)--it utilized imgur.com images, which were not seeming to be very reliable in loading, so the new fiddle is using photobucket.com (let me know if there are persistent image loading issues). I've kept the original link because the explanation code below goes with that (there are a few differences in background-size or position to the new fiddle).The idea came to me almost instantly after reading your question, but took some time to implement. I originally tried getting a single \"hex\" with a single div and just pseudo elements, but as best I could tell, there was no way to just rotate the background-image (which I needed), so I had to add some extra div elements to get the right/left sides of the hex, so that I could then use the pseudo elements as a means of background-image rotation.I tested in IE9, FF, and Chrome. Theoretically any browser supporting CSS3 transform it should work in.First Main Update (added explanation)I have some time now to post some code explanation, so here goes:First, hexagons are defined by 30/60 degree relationships and trigonometry, so those will be the key angles involved. Second, we start with a \"row\" for the hex grid to reside in. The HTML is defined as (the extra div elements help build the hex):We are going to use inline-block for the hexagon display, but we don't want them to accidentally wrap to the next line and ruin the grid, so white-space: nowrap solves that issue. The margin on this row is going to depend on how much space you want between hex's, and some experimentation may be needed to get what you want.Using the immediate children of the .hexrow which are just div elements, we form the basis for the hex shape. The width will drive the horizontal of the top of the hex, the height is derived from that number since all the sides are equal length on a regular hexagon. Again, margin is going to depend on spacing, but this  is where the \"overlap\" of the individual hexagons is going to occur to make the grid look occur.  The background-image is defined once, right here. The shift left on it is to accommodate at least the added width for the left side of the hex. Assuming you want centered text, the text-align handles the horizontal (of course) but the line-height that matches the height is going to allow for a vertical centering.Each odd number hex we are going to shift down in relation to the \"row\" and each even shift up. The shift calculation ( width x cos(30) / 2 ) is also the same as (height / 4).We are using 2 child div elements to create the \"wings\" of the hex. They are sized the same as the main hex rectangle, and then rotated, and pushed \"below\" the main hex. Background-image is inherited so that the image is the same (of course), because the image in the \"wings\" is going to be \"lined up\" to that in the main rectangle. The pseudo elements are used to generate the images, because they need to be \"rerotated\" back to horizontal (since we rotated the parent div of them to create the \"wings\").The :before of the first will translate its background the width of the negative amount equal to the main portion of the  hex plus the original background shift of the main hex. The :before of the second will change the origin point of  the translation and will shift the main width on the x-axis, and half the height on the y-axis.This span houses your text. The line-height is reset to make the lines of text normal, but the vertical-align: middle works since the line-height was larger on the parent. The white-space is reset so it allows wrapping again. The left/right margin can be set to negative to allow the text to go into the \"wings\" of the hex.You can individual target rows and cells in those rows to change images, or span text settings, or opacity, or accommodate a larger image (to shift it to the place you want), etc. That is what the following do for the second row.It actually can be done with just one element per hexagon and pseudo-elements for the background image and text.Basic HTML structure:You can have may more rows, you just need to have n hexagons on odd rows and n+/-1 hexagons on even rows.Relevant CSS:I will provide a simple demo of how to create a hexagonal shape.Here is another approach using COMPASS/SCSS, that allows easily set the hexagons size and layout:http://codepen.io/interdruper/pen/GrBEkif you are able to implement the div shapes trick, then simply give each div a position:relative (you would have to initially position them all one by one at first, by also setting top and left)You can create a fully responsive hexagonal grid using only CSS.\nThe idea is to create a parent shape as a mask using CSS2.1 overflow:hidden which is compatible with almost all browsers, even internet explorer 6.It is a surprisingly simple technique that can be used for creating a responsive grid of all kinds of shapes, it just requires thinking outside of the box to solve the problem.I have an extensive step by step guide on how to do this technique here:\nhttps://www.codesmite.com/article/how-to-create-pure-css-hexagonal-gridsThis is the best way I have found so far, requires no javascript and is both fluid and responsive.I also used the technique in a free HTML template that includes images inside the hexagons which you can demo and download here: https://www.codesmite.com/freebie/hexa-free-responsive-portfolio-templateAFAIK, there is no way of doing in in pure CSS. Your best bet would be to use mask clipping for backgrounds as explained here: http://www.cssbakery.com/2009/06/background-image.html (this will only work if your page background is solid color or you can fit and position your mask to match page background.Then you could use csstextwrap to fit in the text:\nhttp://www.csstextwrap.com/examples.phpThere was a bunch of similar questions on SO.

Ideally, I would like to find a solution which does not assume anything about sizes or special browser quirks. I’m fine with using tables, but I wonder where there is another solution.I think I have finally solved the problem. One commonly recommended solution is to use vertical-align: middle:The problem, however, is that this still produces visible misalignments even though it should theoretically work. The CSS2 specification says that:So it should be in the perfect centre (the x-height is the height of the character x). However, the problem seems to be caused by the fact browsers commonly add some random uneven margins to radio buttons and checkboxes. One can check, for instance in Firefox using Firebug, that the default checkbox margin in Firefox is 3px 3px 0px 5px. I'm not sure where it comes from, but the other browsers seem to have similar margins as well. So to get a perfect alignment, one needs to get rid of these margins:It is still interesting to note that in the table based solution the margins are somehow eaten and everything aligns nicely.The following works in Firefox and Opera (sorry, I do not have access to other browsers at the moment):The CSS:I found the best and easiest way to do it is this one because you don't need to add labels, divs or whatsoever.input { vertical-align: middle; margin-top: -1px;}I wouldn't use tables for this at all. CSS can easily do this. I would do something like this:Note: I have used the clearfix class from : http://www.positioniseverything.net/easyclearing.htmlThis is a bit of a hack but this CSS seems to get it working very nicely in all browsers the same as using tables (apart from chrome)Make sure you use labels with your radios for it to work. i.e.If your label is long and goes on multiple rows setting the width and display:inline-block will help.I found the best fix for this was to give the input a height that matches the label.  At least this fixed my problem with inconsistencies in Firefox and IE.The following code should work :)Regards,This is a simple solution which solved the problem for me:There are several ways to implement it:Below I will insert a checkbox dynamically. Style is included to align the checkbox and most important to make sure word wrap is straight. the most important thing here is display: table-cell; for the alignmentThe visual basic code.'the code to dynamically insert a checkbox'create the checkbox'connect the checkbox'the style for the checkboxand the HTML output@sfjediI've created a class and assigned the css values to it.It is working and you can check it in the below link.\nhttp://jsfiddle.net/gNVsC/\nHope it was useful."},

Without a unit, that isn't really possible.Also, CSS minifiers strip the units off of 0 values anyways, so it won't really matter in the end.They are the same. The browser interprets both as 0, so go with whatever is more readable for you.Zero of anything is zero. 0px = 0% = 0em = 0pt = 0Most people leave the unit off because it is simply unnecessary clutter.As far as I'm aware there is no difference between them, since 0px = 0em = 0ex = 0% = 0. It's purely up to you, as the developer, to decide what you like best (unless you have corporate coding standards that you need to follow, of course). From most of the code samples I've seen, most people use the unitless version. To me, it just looks cleaner. If you're pushing a significant amount of data (say, if you're Google), those two bytes can add up to a lot of bandwidth, especially since you're quite likely to repeat them multiple times in your stylesheet.Zero pixels is equal to zero inches and zero meters and so forth. 0 is all you need.I personally find 0 cleaner than 0px. That's two extra characters that can add up. Why add extra bytes when you don't need to. I have see padding: 0px 0px 0px 0px which can easily be expressed as padding: 0 way too often. You can use either - my best advice is not to worry too much but be consistent in doing it either one way or the other. I personally prefer to specify '0px' for the following reasons:As the others say, it doesn't really matter if its 0, though I choose to add the measurements to all of my values so anyone else looking at my CSS files can gauge what measurements they're likely to deal with elsewhere."},

Or alternatively, can I override the validation method used?You could use the customValidity function for this purpose.If you add a customValidity message to the field, it becomes invalid. When you set the message as an empty string, it becomes valid again (unless it is invalid because of other reasons).field.setCustomValidity(\"Invalid field.\"); will make the field invalid.field.setCustomValidity(\"\"); will make the field valid unless it fails an HTML5 constraint.Edit:\nSomeone clarified that you're looking for \"valid\" \"invalid\" attributes for DOM.I would add attributes to each tag using dom_object.setAttribute(\"isvalid\", \"true\"). You could also have a central validation function which updates these attributes each time (and use dom_object.getAttribute(\"isvalid\") each time).You could run this function each time an element loses focus, or whenever you want.Not exactly elegant, but unfortunately there's no \"pseudo\" support with javascript and HTML5 now.If I understand your question, you can do validation with Javascript. However, be warned that it is very easy to circumvent client side validation, especially javascript validation. You should never trust client data and always do checking on the server side. For example, I could easily find element IDs by inspecting the source code, then do document.getElementById('some_id').setAttribute('max', new_number) to change the max value (this was one of the entries from your link).There are various ways to do it, so I'll try to give you the general idiom.You can grab the value by doing document.getElementById('form_element_id').value (make sure you give the form a name which is sent to the server, and an id which is used by javascript). For textareas, you can use .innerHTML.Then you have the value in a variable, there are various ways to check it.For example, you could do if (parseInt(my_value) < 0) //error.\nYou could also use regular expressions, I won't explain it all but you could start here http://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_obj_regexp.asp . I know w3schools isn't the best source but I find it an okay place to start.Now for the validation part: add onsubmit=\"return validateForm() to your form tag where validateForm() is the function which does all the checking.  And the function just returns true if valid and false otherwise. This overrides the default validation function (which by default does nothing).So in the above example, //error would be replaced by return false. You can do other things too; such as alert the error then return false. You could also use javascript to highlight the invalid fields (not sure if this is what you mean by \"mark an input field as invalid/valid from javascript\")Of course, if you don't want to check all the fields you only have to return true if the certain ones pass. Again, you shouldn't rely on this, but if you're only out to deter average people then it's an easy solution.Unfortunately, you can't style pseudo classes in JavaScript, since they're not real elements, they don't exist in the actual DOM.With vanilla JavaScript you'd use the validation API.In jQuery you can simply do this, http://jsfiddle.net/elclanrs/Kak6S/If you're using HTML5 validation, then stick to the markup. Otherwise, you can disable HTML5 validation with $form.attr('novalidate', 'novalidate') and use JS to validate your fields, and then adding valid or invalid classes where needed. I made a plugin that works like this to support non HTML5 browsers."},

It will work.:)I found a solution that is very easy, just set an empty string into the title attribute.You can disable the tooltip setting a title with a space on webkit browsers like Chrome and an empty string on Firefox or IE (tested on Chrome 35, FF 29, IE 11, safari mobile)This one works for me (at least in Chrome and Firefox):Very easy, forget CSS targeting the input[\"type\"] thing, it doesn't work for me. I don't know why. I got my solution in my HTML tagEnd of the problemThis is a tricky one. I could not find a way to select the 'no file chosen' element so I created a mask using the :after pseudo selector.My solution also requires the use of the following pseudo selector to style the button:Try this: http://jsfiddle.net/J8Wfx/1/FYI: This will only work in webkit browsers.P.S if anyone knows how to view webkit pseudo selectors like the one above in the webkit inspector please let me knowAcross all browsers and simple. this did it for me All the answers here are totally overcomplicated, or otherwise just totally wrong.html:css:javascript:http://jsfiddle.net/odfe34n8/I created this fiddle, in the most simplistic way. Clicking the Select File button will bring up the file select menu. You could then stylize the button any way you wanted. Basically, all you need to do is hide the file input, and trigger a synthetic click on it when you click another button. I spot tested this on IE 9, FF, and Chrome, and they all work fine.You will need to customise the control quite a lot to achieve this.Please follow the guide at: http://www.quirksmode.org/dom/inputfile.htmlWrap  with  and make  invisible.\nWork in Chrome, Safari && FF.Even you set opacity to zero, the tooltip will appear. Try visibility:hidden on the element. It is working for me.Give -webkit-appearance: a go. Worth a try anyway.http://css-infos.net/property/-webkit-appearanceHope that helps :)Directly you can't modify much about input[type=file].Make input type file opacity:0 and try to place a relative element [div/span/button] over it with custom CSS Try this\nhttp://jsfiddle.net/gajjuthechamp/pvyVZ/8/It's better to avoid using unnecessary javascript. You can take advantage of the label tag to expand the click target of the input like so:Even though input is hidden, the link still works as a click target for it, and you can style it however you want.Surprise to see no one mentioned about event.preventDefault()you can set a width for yor element which will show only the button and will hide the \"no file chosen\".I look for good answer for this... and I found this:First delete the 'no file chosen'then work the button with the -webkit-file-upload-button, this way:hope this is what you were looking for, it works for me.Combining some of the suggestions above, using jQuery, here is what I did:And:And put the class \"unused\" on your file inputs.  This is simple and works pretty well.The best solution, for me, is to wrap input [type=\"file\"] in a  wrapper, and add some jquery code:I came up with a hacky solution that totally removes \"No file chosen\" plus the extra space that is added after that text (in Chrome I get something like: \n\"No file chosen                   \"). This was totally messing up my page alignment, so I really fought with it to find a solution. Inside the input tag's style attribute, setting \"width\" to the width of the button will eliminate the trailing text and spaces. Since the width of the button is not the same in all browsers (it's a little smaller in Firefox, for example), you'll also want to set the style's color to the same color as the background of the page (otherwise a stray \"No\" may show through). My input file tag looks like this: It works for me!Then, you can use different kind of styles such as width, height or other properties in order to create your own input file."},

Or zoom back out?It is probably because the browser is trying to zoom the area since the font size is less than the threshold, this generally happens in iphone.Giving a metatag attribute \"user-scalable=no\" will restrict the user from zooming elsewhere. Since the problem is with select element only, try using the following in your css, this hack is originally used for jquery mobile.HTML :CSS:src: unzoom after selecting in iphoneuser-scalable=no is what you need, just so there's actually a definitive answer to this questionThis seemed to work for my case in addressing this issue:Suggested here by Christina Arasmo BeymeriPhone's will zoom form fields slightly if the text is set to less than 16 pixels. I'd suggest setting the mobile form field's text to be 16 pixels and then override the size back down for desktop.The answers saying to disable zoom are unhelpful for partially sighted users may still want to zoom on smaller mobiles.Example:I am a bit late to the party, but I found a pretty neat workaround that solves this issue only with css manipulation. In my case I couldn't change the font size due to design reasons, and I couldn't disable zooming as well.Since iPhone's will zoom form fields slightly if the text is set to less than 16 pixels, we can trick the iPhone to think that the font size is 16px and then transform it to our size.For example, lets take the example when our text is 14px, so it does zoom because it is smaller than 16px. Therefore we can transform the scale, according to 0.875.In the following example I've added the padding to show how to convert other properties accordingly.I hope it helps!Try this:DisablePinchZoom will be fired before the onchange so zoom will be disable at the time the onchange is fired.\nOn the onchange function, at the end you can restore the initial situation.Tested on an iPhone 5SiOS zooms the page to show a larger input field if its font-size is less than 16px.only On click of any field, it's zooming the page. so on click, we are making it as 16px and then changed to default valuebelow snippet works fine to me and targeted for mobile devices,Set all 'select' font size to 16pxselect{\nfont-size: 16px;\n}I don't think you can't do anything about the behavior in isolation.One thing you can try is keep the page from zooming at all. This is good if your page is designed for the phone.Another thing you could try is using a JavaScript construct instead of the generic \"select\" statement. Create a hidden div to show your menu,  process the clicks in javascript.Good luck!As answered here: Disable Auto Zoom in Input \"Text\" tag - Safari on iPhoneYou can prevent Safari from automatically zooming in on text fields during user input without disabling the user’s ability to pinch zoom. Just add maximum-scale=1 but leave out the user-scale attribute suggested in other answers.It is a worthwhile option if you have a form in a layer that “floats” around if zoomed, which can cause important UI elements to move off screen.<meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1\">Try adding this CSS to disable Ios' default styling:This will also work on other elements that get special styling, like input[type=search].Been reading for a few hours on this and the best solution is this jquery here.  This also helps with the \"next tab\" option in iOS Safari.  I have inputs here as well but feel free to remove them or add as you like.  Basically the mousedown fires before the focus event and tricks the browser into thinking its 16px.  In addition, the focusout will trigger on the \"next tab\" feature and repeat the process."},

I still needed the translate or a negative margin offset. Why do I need a negative offset when the parent element is set to margin: 0;? Is it because of a computed margin that I'm not taking into account?By default, your element is at the top of the page, and the top of the element is at 0:When you move it down by 50% height (50% of the entire page), the top of the element is at the 50% mark, meaning the element starts at 50% and is not centered.When the top of the element is at the halfway mark, we can move the element back up by half of its own height to center it with the whole page. That's exactly what transform:translateY(-50%); does:But why can't we just say top: 25% or something like that? I've made a quick snippet to show you the difference with that implementation:While others have provided the answer that the -50 moves the inner element back up half it's own height, I thought this little animation showing the movement to top: 50%; first, followed by transform: translateY(-50%); second, might help.… moves the element down a distance equal to half the height of the parent.Since the default position puts the top of the inner element at the top of the outer element, this puts the top of the inner element at the middle of the outer element.This moves the inner element back up a distance of half the height of the inner element.Combining them puts the middle of the inner element at the middle of the parent element.Rather than answering this question directly, I'm going to answer the more general question of:How does position anchoring work in CSS?Hopefully, in answering the question generally, you'll understand the parts that apply to your specific case.Position anchoring is when a DOM node is positioned in a way that it is \"anchored\" to its parent in a given dimension. If the top left of the node is anchored to the top left of its parent, the nodes will stay aligned at their top left corner, no matter the size of either element.I'm going to use a template for all further examples, so it's important to understand the base example.This example shows a parent .container which has dark red, dark yellow, dark green, and dark blue quadrants to easily view alignment. Inside, it contains a .box which has red, yellow, green, and blue quadrants to show contrast for the alignment.All further examples will have this boilerplate minified to make the relevant code stand out more.Note that by default, the top left of the child is anchored to the top left of the parent.Parent anchoring can be adjusted by using the top, bottom, left, and right properties on the child element.Using the top property will anchor the top edge of the child to the top edge of the parent.Assuming bottom isn't set, top: 0 won't show differently than the default of top: autoUsing a percentage will align the top edge of the child at the given percentage from the top of the parent.top: 50% is the middle of the parent:top: 100% is the bottom of the parent:Bottom anchoring will anchor the bottom edge of the child to the bottom edge of the parent:bottom: 50% is the middle of the parent, with the child aligned opposite from top: 50%:bottom: 100% is the top of the parent:The left property will anchor the left edge of the child to the left edge of the parent.Assuming right isn't set, left: 0 won't show differently than the default of left: auto.left: 50% is the middle of the parent:left: 100% leaves the child hanging off the right side of the parent.The right property will anchor the right edge of the child to the right edge of the parent:right: 50% is the middle of the parent, with the child aligned opposite from left: 50%:right: 100% leaves teh child hanging off the left side of the parent.Child anchoring can be adjusted independently from parent anchoring by making use of the transform property. Specifically the translate, translateX, and translateY functions will be used to bump the child box to use a different alignment.The reason this works is because percentages in the translate value are relative to the child, while percentages in the top, bottom, left, and right properties are relative to the parent.Using transform: translateY(), the alignment of the child can be bumped up or down.transform: translateY(0) will leave the child where it is, and is generally not very useful.When the child is anchored to the top of the parent, transform: translateY(-50%) will align the child at its center:Likewise, when the child is anchored to the bottom of the parent, transform: translate(50%) will align the child at its center:This also means that top: 100% is equivalent to bottom: 0; transform: translateY(100%):Using transform: translateX(), the alignment of the child can be bumped left or right.transform: translateX(0) will leave the child where it is by default.When the child is anchored to the left of the parent, transform: translateX(-50%) will align the child at its center:Likewise, when the child is anchored to the right of the parent, transform: translateX(50%) will align the child at its center:left: 100% is equivalent to right: 0; transform: translateX(100%).Centering is just a matter of aligning the child to the middle of the parent, and then bumping the child's origin into place.Because of the symmetry, you could also use:"},

You can only style the visited state.For other people who find this, make sure that you have them in the right order:If you just want the anchor color to stay the same as the anchor's parent element you can leverage inherit:  Notice there is no need to repeat the rule for each selector; just use a comma separated list of selectors (order matters for anchor pseudo elements).  Also, you can apply the pseudo selectors to a class if you want to selectively disable the special anchor colors:Your question only asks about the visited state, but I assumed you meant all of the states.  You can remove the other selectors if you want to allow color changes on all but visited. For :hover to override :visited, and to make sure :visited is the same as the initial color, :hover must come after :visited.So if you want to disable the color change, a:visited must come before a:hover. Like this:To disable :visited change you would style it with non-pseudo class:Either delete the selector or set it to the same color as your text appears normally.I think if I set a color for a:visited it is not good: you must know the default color of tag a and every time synchronize it with a:visited.I don't want know about the default color (it can be set in common.css of your application, or you can using outside styles).I think it's nice solution:HTML:CSS:You can solve this issue by calling a:link and a:visited selectors together.

Note that I have deliberately omitted absolute positioning on the #container div. In this case how is the browser calculating the height of the body and how is the margin affecting it?Example also on JSFiddleIf you paint the backgrounds of html and body (giving each its own color), you'll quickly notice that body is being shifted down along with #container, and #container itself isn't offset from the top of body at all. This is a side effect of margin collapse, which I cover in detail here (although that answer describes a slightly different setup).It's this behavior that's causing the scrollbar to appear, since you've declared body to have 100% the height of html. Note that the actual height of body is unaffected, as margins are never included in height calculations.A bit late, but maybe it helps someone.Adding float: left; to #container removes the scrollbar, as W3C says: •Margins between a floated box and any other box do not collapse (not even between a float and its in-flow children).Based upon @BoltClock♦'s answer, I fixed it by zeroing the margin...\nsoworks where id \"st-full-pg\" is assigned to a panel div (which further contained panel-heading and panel-body)adding float:left; is nice, but will interfere with central horizontal positioning using margin:auto;if you know how big your margin is, you can account for that in your height percentage using calc:browser support is good, but only IE11+\nhttps://caniuse.com/#feat=calcAdd overflow: hidden; to html and body.This worked for meI have found a solution: add padding: 1px 0; to body prevents vertical scrollbars to appearInspired by @BoltClock, I tried this and it worked, even when zoom out and in.Browser: Chrome 51I guess body was shifted down 20px. If you want to remove the body scrolling add the following style:I saw this problem fixed before where you put all the contents of body in a div called wrap. Wrap's style should be set to position: relative; min-height: 100%;. To position #container div 50px from the top and left put a div inside wrap with a padding set to 50px. Margins will not work with wrap and the div we just made, but they will work in #container and everything inside it.here's my fix on jsfiddle.For those who are coming here for an easier to understand answer that even includes code samples, this answer (copied from here) is for you.No JavaScript or definite pixel values (such as 100px) are required, just, pure CSS and percentages.If your div is just sitting there on its own, height: 50% will mean 50% the height of the body. Normally, the height of the body is zero without any visible content, so 50% of that is just, well, zero.This is the solution (based on this) (uncomment the background lines to get a visualisation of the padding):The above was written so that there would still be the usual padding. You could set the dimensions of the red div to 100% and still see padding on each side/end. If you don't want this padding, use this (although it doesn't look nice, I recommend you stick with the first example):I found a quick solution: try set height to 99.99% instead of 100%"},

Does it reduce readability or cause problems?", "url": "[Should I avoid using “text-align: justify;”?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/315845/should-i-avoid-using-text-align-justify)", "vote": 76, "content": "Is there any reason to avoid using text-align: justify;?  Does it reduce readability or cause problems?Firstly, this is purely a design-related problem and solution. The design of your grid  specifies if justifying text is needed. I think justify align alone has no major effect on usability. Bad typography that makes text illegible is what decreases usability. That said, make sure you have solid contrasts and a good balance of spacing in your type. Font-size matters too.This site is a successful attempt at justifying text online. Since you can't control the  spaces between letters and words nearly as much with CSS as you can with InDesign, it's a lot harder to justify text and not have 'rivers' of whitespace run down your rows, which happens when the spaces between words exceeds the spaces between lines. Things that make justifying text difficult: long words, row widths that don't hold enough words, and too much contrast between the text and the background colors; they make the rivers appear wider and more apparent.The typographic ideal is to have an even text-block, where if you squint the text block becomes a uniform solid shade. So if you keep text at about 10px and 60% gray on white background, and have rows that fit about 20 words, justify align shouldn't look ugly. But keep in mind this does nothing to improve usability. Small, relatively light text annoys a lot of people, especially the older readers. I should note that with &shy; (soft hyphenation) correctly separating long troublesome words like super­awesome you can mimic proper typesetting (e.g. InDesign). There's a lot of stuff out there to help you do this. I would recommend the logic for hiding, manipulating, and displaying the text to be done on the client side, perhaps with this.Edit: As others mention below, css hyphens are possible now, except not feasible (not in Chrome). Plus, css4 offers even more control.text-align: justify shouldn't be used in browsers at the moment. They aren't good at handling the minute details within and the output ends up containing lots of rivers and there's no support for hyphenation (other than soft hyphens).Note above was written 4.5 years ago. Things are slowly changing... http://caniuse.com/#feat=css-hyphensEdit:\nHyphenator was brought to my attention in this answer's comments. It looks like it makes text-align justify worth using, check out the sites that use it. You may want to use javascript to apply text-align justify before using this script so that those without javascript don't get caught out.Edit 2:\nCSS now allows for hyphenation with the hyphens property [browser support]. PPK is now saying to add it to your stylesheets, whilst Eric Meyer says just add it for mobile.Edit 3:\nA good little overview of things available to us now, with some SASS.The problems brought up by others about justify alignment are more prevalent with narrow columns. If your columns are wide enough in relation to the size of your fonts and other parameters then it's ok to justify the text. Let's say you'd want a minimum of 12 to 15 words per line in average. More is better.There's no technical reason not to - it's purely a design decision. Many people find that justified text is harder to read, but I guess it depends on your situation. Though it works fine for print, generally web browsers do not give enough control over the eventual output of text to guarantee that what you're serving won't look like crap on some people's screens.Your best option is to avoid justification.I cant think of a compelling reason why not to justify text - at a certain point the volume and width of content almost demand that it be justified. Of course, you'll get issues with content consisting of certain word combinations, but to my mind if you're seeing rivers and unusually large spaces between words you have a different problem altogether - one of readability and clarity.What I would avoid, at all costs, is centered body text. I don't think there's a greater red flag of ammateurish web design than that.I prefer left justification (text-align: left) because it's generally more readable.  It's also quicker to read evenly-spaced words, so I hear.  Unless you have a stylistic reason for using justify, keep it left, right, or center.  Especially for body text, use left.  (Actually, you'd want something like \"forward\" for text in the other direction (e.g. Hebrew)...)Like any web design question... it depends. As has been suggested, justified text does not usually end up looking good in narrow columns. I'd recommend against it as a general rule in sidebars as sidebars are usually narrow.With body copy at the often recommended 10 words per line (or with any amount above that) you will probably be able to get away with justified text and have it look reasonably good most of the time unless you're using a lot of really long words and/or strings.I think I've pimped this site on StackOverflow before, but Jon Tan uses justified text in his body copy (within articles) and it looks great 99.99% of the time.Justification should not be used without hyphenation. Here is a PHP based hyphenation library, and a port of this library to a WordPress plugin:  wp-Typography.I think it is perfectly OK on print, but it is clunky on most Web browsers, by lack of fine control of spacing and hyphenation. Typographers can even play slightly on letter spacing or font contraction in some cases, as pages/columns (at least in magazines) can be finely tuned.Erhh... No...![seriously] WordPress uses justify, and I think that's a pretty strong statement in regards to whether or not it decreases readability...You can also use text-justify:newspaper. The text-justify css tag helps you control how you wrap the text when you justifyIt should be mentioned that Internet Explorer (at least) up to version 8 does not render text-align: justify correctly. Instead it is interpreted as text-align: center. Here is more info: text-align: justifyCaused me some headaches to find out why IE kept centering stuff. Maybe it saves somebody else some time.Text justification can be done in several ways.Couple of definitions:  Adjusting the spacing between words is \"tracking\"  Adjusting the spacing between characters is \"kerning\"  Good layout programs do some kerning automatically, and it varies by letter pair. The va of variable can be kerned closer than the xa in exact.  Good fonts have built in tables of kerning hints to aid in this process.  In early days of monospace fonts it was done by inserting extra spaces between words.  This made for very clunky looking output. If you had 4 spaces at the end of the line, and 6 spaces in the line, 4 of them would become double spaces. Monospace fonts shouldn't be justified. With variable width fonts, we have em spaces, en spaces, etc, and so the space could be better distributed.I think this is where most browsers are now.  It works reasonably well most of the time.  For it to work well the following conditions need to hold:The average word in English is 5 characters.  So on the average you will have 5 characters (the 5 character word plus space wouldn't fit so gets bumped to the next line) If you have 10 words on the line, then you need to add about half a standard space to each interword gap.If the last word is a long one, like \"headaches\" and there isn't room for it, now you have 10 spaces to distribute.  This starts to look bad.This is where a hyphenation dictionary comes into play.  Hyphenation can be done by algorithm, but there are enough exceptions that having a dictionary helps a lot. (There is a special character ­ for soft hyphens for words not in your dictionary.) Hyphenation can split a word so that the the line fills more evenly.Empirically I decided that a 65 em line length made a good compromise.  This gives 11-13 words per line a lot of the time.  Another approach to justification is to split the space up between characters.  This avoids some of the problems above, but still looks odd if you are distributing a lot of space in not enough line. You see this in newspapers now and then where a word seems to have a full space between each character.  This is a good argument for a longer line. Good typesetting programs (InDesign, *TeX, Framemaker) do a combination of extra space in interword gaps, and tiny extra spaces between characters.There is a new kid on the block, text-justify that can be used in CSS to modify the use of text-align: justify.  Nominally it accepts the optionsCanIuse https://caniuse.com/#search=text-justify \nCSS working group https://drafts.csswg.org/css-text-3/#text-justify-propertyCanIuse reports compliance only for Firefox right now, Chrome supports it but requires that you enable experimental features.  CanIuse claims that support is buggy.  Going to the Chromium bug tracking site, claims that it's fixed.  Go figure.  Haven't tested.Other pragmatic points:I made four changes to my site's style sheet:The result was that time on site and pages per session doubled.  Anecdotal, but may be worth your own test."},

Could be wrong. I tried adding <style=\"display: list-item; list-style-type:disc;\"> on <p> elements, and didn't get bullets. (Tested with Chrome only).You could actually add bullet characters (&bull;) manually or programmatically to the start of each p element, and set margin and padding to look like a UL/LI block, I guess.The bullets on list items are an example of generated content. Other examples of generated content include the numbers in ordered lists, CSS counters and the :before and :after pseudo-elements.Setting display: list-item on an element will make it display bullets. You can change the appearance and position too.See examples below:For more precise control I would suggest that you use pseudo elements (and CSS counters if you want to count)."},

This does not appear to be an issue in \"modern\" brosers, however, this is an issue I have seen, so be sure to check cross-browser performance.For instance, I discovered that in IE prior to 9, colSpan is set for all TD's in a Table, so any single cell has the hidden colspan value of 1.So if you were targetting \"any TD with colspan attribute\" you apply in your webdoc, even the td's having no colspan attribute set, such as any TD being a single cell, will receive the css styling.  IE less than 9 will basically style them all!Only reason to concern over this is all the remaining XP users out there who cannot upgrade above IE8.So for Example, I have a group of tables where the content may shift from end to end, leaving anywhere from 1 to 7 cells blank either at the end or the beginning.I want to apply a color to any blank cells at the end or the beginning utilizing the colspan attribute.\nUsing the following will not work in IE less than 9...all TD's will get styled (funny since the conditional attribute styling was supposedly superior in IE, but I digress...).Using the following works across all browsers when I set the value of colspan to 'single' for any solitary cell/TD I wish to include in the styling scheme, however its a 'hack' and will not properly validate...Alternatively you should be able to more appropriately address the issue using conditional styling using \"if lt IE 9\" to override.  It would be the correct way to do this, just keep in mind you must hide the \"properly constructed css\" from IElt9 in the process, and I think the only proper way to do that is with selective style sheets.  Most of us already do that anyway, but regardless, you still do well to consider and test if a browser applies an auto-attribute when it sees none, and how it may handle your otherwise corect syntax for styling on attribute values.(btw, colspan just happens not to be in the css specification yet [as of css3], so this example throws no validation error.)"},

I Just found a partial solution to chrome (not invalving flash, javascript, extra DOM manipulation with overflow hidden).The problem is that button's doesn't inherit the cursor property in general(?) but the rest of the input[type=file] field dose.\nThats why chrome get the pointer except the buttonIt works differently in different browsers. I guess it's because the file input type is quite special.What browser/version do you use?I know that IE6 does not support to specify the type in the style.Works perfectly.Issue is fixed, so now it works perfectly. See bug report on this issue.\nIn version 3.5 it did not work at all.Uses arrow over the button, but your defined cursor over the rest.Works perfectly.Note that there are several workarounds using different techniques that will come around this problem. The answer by BjarkeCK is one elegant solution that I like, and it works on all major browsers. cursor:pointer does not work on input file just because of the default button. No special reason here. You need to remove its appearance via this code, pay attention with font-size:0.It works perpectly on Chrome, Firefox and IE. I met this issue today and with:It seems to do fine :-)If\nyou want to force the cursor to be hand in order to put it on an image, here is aHTML:JQuery:Then you can press on any button to upload file, and you have a pointer cursor .In Chrome and Opera the cursor becomes a pointer on the padding only and if display:block; , that's why for those browsers you should do this:I made the following:for li:for input:As it was mentioned before, cursor becomes \"pointer\" on the whole input, excluding the button. In most browsers the button is on the left side or on the right side. Ok! Lets give the input a huge width and show only the middle... Button will be hidden. And clickable is the whole input.That works for me.If you're trying to do Ajax uploader, you might try another technique for compatible browsers such as FireFox and Chrome. They support triggering a click event on totally invisible file input. You can hide file input in any way you want except setting it's display property to none. Setting { height: 0; overflow: hidden } on parent form will do the trick. I use separate forms for each uploader.Redirect your custom button click event to hidden file input and you're done.To use this technique you must perform navigator.userAgent check for Gecko or WebKit engine. For other engines you have to use old transparent file input method.I found out that there's another approach to make it. Works perfectly in Opera New, FF, Chrome and Safari. Unfortunately it doesn't work perfect in IE (but good enough for my case).The idea is to wrap input=file element with fixed size div and hidden overflow and set cursor: pointer;. Than we move button outside of the div using left padding.and sample stylesHere you can find live example: http://jsfiddle.net/5c5RH/2/First of all, your code works on Internet Explorer, but doesn't on Firefox.Second, W3C Css standard doesn't allow styling complex tags like <input />.

Search through your HTML and JS for onmousedown handlers and look for a line that reads.This line may be stopping you from focusing by clicking.Re: your comment, I'm assuming you can't edit the code that adds this handler?  If you can, the simplest solution is to just remove the return false; statement.That depends on how the handler is attached.  If it's attached using the traditional registration method, e.g. element.onmousedown, then you could create a wrapper for it:Since this \"wrapper\" doesn't return false, it will not cancel the default action (focusing) for the element.  If your event is attached using an advanced registration method, such as addEventListener or attachEvent then you could only remove the event handler using the function name/reference and reattach it with a wrapped function similar to the above.  If it's an anonymous function that's added and you can't get a reference to it, then the only solution would be to attach another event handler and focus the element manually using the element.focus() method.I had this problem too. I used the disableSelection() method of jQuery UI on a parent DIV which contained my input fields. In Chrome the input fields were not affected but in Firefox the inputs (and textareas as well) did not get focused on clicking. The strange thing here was, that the click event on these inputs worked.The solution was to remove the disableSelection() method for the parent DIV.I know this is a very old thread, but this just happened to me recently; took me a while to figure it out.  This same issue can be caused by putting 'input' elements inside of pair of 'label' tags.  In my case, I had intended to create a pair of 'div' tags but instead I accidently created a pair of 'label' tags, then inserted some text input fields 'input type=\"text\"..' using DOM.  It displayed normally on the screen, but when I clicked on any of the text fields, the cursor kept jumping back to the first 'input' and really acting erratic.  Took me a while to figure this out because this behavior is subtle, and not at all what I would have expected from making this kind of mistake.bsniderUse the onclick=\"this.select()\" attribute for the input tag.I've been struggling with the same problem a while ago. I was using the jquery.layout plugin in a modal jquery-ui dialog and I couldn't access any of the fields in it.It appeared to be a z-index problem (some div was over my input fields, so I couldn't click them). You should check it out and try changing the z-index value of your input fields.This happens sometimes when there are unbalanced <label> tags in the form. I had this problem too, and in my case I found that the color of the font was the same color of the background, so it looked like nothing happened.If you are faced this problem while using canvas with DOM on mobile devices, the answer of Ashwin G worked for me perfectly, but I did it through javascriptAfter, everything worked flawlessly.I have read all the answers above, and some directed me to the problem, but not to the solution for the problem.The root cause of the problem is disableSelection(). It is causing all the problems, but removing it is not a solution, as (at least in 2016 or slightly before), on touch-screen devices, you \"have\" to use this if you want to be able to move objects with jQuery.The solution was to leave the disableSelection() to the sortable element, but also add a binding action just above:The form in the jQuery element is just  to stop propagation on the form, as you might need propagation on some elements.This can occur in bootstrap if you do not place your columns inside a <div class ='row'>. The column floats are not cleared and you could get the next column overlying the previous, hence clicks wont hit the dom elements where you expect.I had the similar issue - could not figure out what was the reason, but I fixed it using following code. Somehow it could not focus only the blank inputs:I had this problem because of this code: I resolved it by removing New code:I'm using JQuery UI and Bootstrap so I faced this issue and I think it is a conflict between the two as in normal case the textarea or the input filed is editable by nature but I made this solution after testing all the above answers but none solve the cross browser support for all major browsers, but I solved it and I like to share my solution you can use it on input text and textarea (Tested on Desktop: IE (All Versions), Chrome, Safari, Windows Edge, Firefox, Visual Studio Cordova Ripple Viewer on Windows & Visual Studio Cordova Windows 10 Store App)(Tested on Mobile: Chrome, Firefox, Android Internet Browser & Visual Studio Cordova App on Android & Visual Studio Cordova Windows 8 + 8.1 + 10 Phone App)This is the HTML Code:This is The CSS Code:This Is The JQuery Code On Document ReadyYou can test it on my web application at www.gahwehsada.comWhen you sayIs this through viewing your html, the source code of the page, or the DOM?If you inspect the DOM with Chrome or Firefox, then you will be able to see any attributes added to the input fields through javasript, or even an overlaying divJust in case someone else is looking for this answer, we had a similar problem and solved it by changing the z-index of the input tags.  Apparently some other divs had extended too far and were overlapping the input boxes.I had this problem for over 6 months, it may be the same issue. Main symptom is that you can't move the cursor or select text in text inputs, only the arrow keys allow you to move around in the input field. Very annoying problem, especially for textarea input fields. I have this html that gets populated with 1 out of 100s of forms via Javascript:Apparently 6 months ago I had tried to make the popup draggable and failed, breaking text inputs at the same time. Once I removed  draggable=\"true\" it works again!I just found another possible reason for this issue, some input textboxes were missing the closing \"/\", so i had <input ...> when the correct form is <input ... />. That fixed it for me.In my case it was Bootstrap popup in opened state.\nText input was in another calendar popup on top of Bootstrap one, input got its focus back after removing tabindex=\"-1\" attribute from Bootstrap modal.iPhone6 chromeProblem for me  was placing the input field inside <label> and <p>like this :  I changed them to And it works for me . After check this answer, Please check other answers in this page, this issue may have different reasonsThis will also happen anytime a div ends up positioned over controls in another div; like using bootstrap for layout, and having a \"col-lg-4\" followed by a \"col-lg=8\" misspelling... the right orphaned/misnamed div covers the left, and captures the mouse events. Easy to blow by that misspelling, - and = next to each other on keyboard.  So, pays to examine with inspector and look for 'surprises' to uncover these wild divs.Is there an unseen window covering the controls and blocking events, and how can that happen?  Turns out, fatfingering = for - with bootstrap classnames is one way...    I had the same problem. I eventually figured it out by inspecting the element and the element I thought I had selected was different element. When I did that I found there was a hidden element that had z-index of 9999, once I fixed that my problem went away.the problem for me was that I was using  class=\"modal fade\", I changed it for  class=\"modal hide\". That solved the issue.I had the same problem. Tore my hair for hours trying all sorts of solutions. Turned out to be an unclosed a tag.Try validate your HTML code, solution could be an unclosed tag causing issuesI had this issue using Bootstrap + contact form 7.\nI for some reason I put the label as the container of the form and that was the issue for not being selectable on mobile.Seemed to break all inputs except the first input and the submit. I had the same issue and the fix was to remove the placeholders and I changed the design of the form to use labels instead of placeholders...I had this issue caused by a sort of overlap of a div element with a bootstrap class =\"row\" over a \"brother\" div element with the class=\"col\", the first hid the focus of the second div element. I solved taking outer the div row element from that level of the divs' tree and so rebalancing bootstrap logical hierarchy based on the row and col classes.I had this same issue just now in React.I figured out that in the Router, Route. We cannot do this as it causes this issue of closing the mobile keyboard.Make sure and use the render instead in this situationHope this helps someone Daniel"},

With this particular issue you should be targeting the ::-ms-expand pseudo element:But!, If we want to add width, we can not do so as: display:noneSo Internet Explorer 10 doesn't support conditional comments, so you'll have to do something else. One solution is to sniff the user agent with JavaScript and add the class yourself:You should probably add this in the <head> so that you don't have a flash of unstyled content, but that might not be a problem.Also, if you're using jQuery, you might want to do something like this:If you want to check for IE10 or above, copy-paste the getInternetExplorerVersion function from this Microsoft page and then change the if to something like this:I had an issue with a hidden drop down arrow on the site on IE 10 and 11 that I am working which uses Zurb Foundation.

Data URIs are now widely supported and IE 7/8 is no longer a relevant browser.  There are many references below because the answer is nuanced today.The data URI spec does not define a size limit but says applications may impose their own.One technology with a higher limit (500MiB in Chrome) that may be an alternative for your use case is Blob URLs via URL.createObjectURL() using the URL API together with blobs via the File API.  An example of that is provided in Using URL.createObjectURL().A few other alternatives as mentioned in How to write a file / give it to the user are: FileSaver.js, StreamSaver.js, and JSZip.You can use Modernizr to detect support for data URIs over 32kb.These answers are pretty much the same as this question, but I mention them to save you the time of reading each one.I just made a quick check embedding eight different Jpeg-images ranging from 3,844 to 2,233,076 Bytes in size.All of the following browsers displayed every image correctly on my Windows 7 (64-bit) system:From http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2397.txt:I've read that Safari has a limit of 128K for data URIs:http://blog.clawpaws.net/post/2007/07/16/Storing-iPhone-apps-locally-with-data-URLs#c1989348And Chrome is 2M:http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=44820#c1It is really the \"data URI scheme\".As per the Wikipedia page, IE7 lacks support, and IE8 betas limit it to 32kB of data.2017 answer is:\nconvert data: to blob with function: dataURLtoBlobthen create blob urlthen use it in new window if you need.works with big files in chrome/firefox 2017Just an FYI, I was able to load a 130K image using a data url in Firefox 3.5 from a JavaScript ajax call.

All you have to do is change the css.Here's a fiddle with a very simple fade animation: http://jsfiddle.net/elthrasher/sNpjH/To make it into a sliding animation, I first had to put my element in a box (that's the slide-container), then I added another element to replace the one that was leaving, just because I thought it would look nice. Take it out and the example will still work.I changed the animation css from 'fade' to 'slide' but please note that these are the names I gave it. I could have written slide animation css named 'fade' or anything else for that matter.The important part is what's in the css. Here's the original 'fade' css:This code changes the opacity of the element from 0 (completely transparent) to 1 (completely opaque) and back again. The solution is to leave opacity alone and instead change the top (or left, if you want to move left-right).I'm also changing from relative to absolute positioning so only one of the elements takes up space in the container at a time.Here's the finished product: http://jsfiddle.net/elthrasher/Uz2Dk/. Hope this helps!update for Angular 1.2+ (v1.2.6 at the time of this post):(plunker)This can actually be done in CSS and very minimal JS just by adding a CSS class (don't set styles directly in JS!) with e.g. a ng-clickevent. The principle is that one can't animate height: 0; to height: auto; but this can be tricked by animating the max-height property. The container will expand to it's \"auto-height\" value when .foo-open is set - no need for fixed height or positioning.see this fiddle by the excellent Lea VerouAs a concern raised in the comments, note that while this animation works perfectly with linear easing, any exponential easing will produce a behaviour different from what could be expected - due to the fact that the animated property is max-height and not height itself; specifically, only the height fraction of the easing curve of max-height will be displayed.I ended up abandoning the code for my other answer to this question and going with this answer instead.I believe the best way to do this is to not use ng-show and ng-animate at all.This class-based javascript animation works in AngularJS 1.2 (and 1.4 tested)Edit:  I ended up abandoning this code and went a completely different direction. I like my other answer much better. This answer will give you some problems in certain situations.});Simply add the .ng-hide-toggle-slidedown class to the container element, and the jQuery slide down behavior will be implemented based on the ng-hide class.    You must include the $(element).css({display:'none'}) line in the beforeRemoveClass method because jQuery will not execute a slideDown unless the element is in a state of display: none prior to starting the jQuery animation.  AngularJS uses the CSS          to hide the element.  jQuery is not aware of this state, and jQuery will need the display:none prior to the first slide down animation.The AngularJS animation will add the .ng-hide-animate and .ng-animate classes while the animation is occuring.You should use Javascript animations for this - it is not possible in pure CSS, because you can't know the height of any element. Follow the instructions it has for you about javascript animation implementation, and copy slideUp and slideDown from jQuery's source.What's wrong with actually using ng-animate for ng-show as you mentioned?"},

This is because the browser default of the html element font-size is 16px and 10rem * 16px =  160.The inside square is 10em big. Because its parent element is 5px the square is 5em * 10px  =  50px.By setting all units to rem have the following advantages:rem , em and px are different units of font-size in css.em\nAn em is equal to the computed font-size of that element’s parent.\nex: div element defined with font-size: 16px, its children 1em = 16px.rem\nrem values are relative to the root html element. \nex: If font-size of the root element is 16px,1 rem = 16px for all elements.Reference:\nhttps://medium.com/code-better/css-units-for-font-size-px-em-rem-79f7e592bb97https://stackoverflow.com/a/13941345/9093112 - it's a best answerm but I only want to add"},

Please don't suggest that I change the way it functions currently. Thanks!CSS transitions work by defining two states for the object using CSS.  In your case, you define how the object looks when it has the class \"saved\" and you define how it looks when it doesn't have the class \"saved\" (it's normal look).  When you remove the class \"saved\", it will transition to the other state according to the transition settings in place for the object without the \"saved\" class.If the CSS transition settings apply to the object (without the \"saved\" class), then they will apply to both transitions.We could help more specifically if you included all relevant CSS you're using to with the HTML you've provided.My guess from looking at your HTML is that your transition CSS settings only apply to .saved and thus when you remove it, there are no controls to specify a CSS setting.  You may want to add another class \".fade\" that you leave on the object all the time and you can specify your CSS transition settings on that class so they are always in effect.The @jfriend00's answer helps me to understand the technique to animate only remove class (not add).A \"base\" class should have transition property (like transition: 2s linear all;). This enables animations when any other class is added or removed on this element. But to disable animation when other class is added (and only animate class removing) we need to add transition: none; to the second class.ExampleCSS:HTML:JS (only needed to add class):plunker of this example.With this code only removing of recently-updated class will be animated.Basically set up your css like:In my case i had some problem with opacity transition so this one fix it:Mouse EnterMouse Leave"},

If you need to maintain the icon inside the original container width, you can add padding to compensate again:IMPORTANT UPDATE:For this method to work, there must be no white space between the text and the closing tag of the element holding the pseudo element. Even though the pseudo element's width is compensated by a negative margin, the white space will make the line break when it meets the edge of the parent element. For example, this works:and this doesn't:This is a little similar to a previous answer, but I thought that I'd flesh it out and explain it fully.As soon as you set display: inline-block, :after becomes a non-text-binding element. This is why it wraps, and why nowrap has no effect. So leave display alone.As it's a text element by default, the content binds to previous text, as long as there's no whitespace between them. So don't add any, but make sure you have content: \"\", or it's the same as display: none. The only problem is height and width are controlled by the content, which in this case is collapsed. So width is 0, and height is the line height. Resize the area with padding; left or right, it doesn't matter. Add a little margin so the icon doesn't touch the text. Keep everything as relative sizes (em, pt, etc.), and use background-size: contain, so that the icon scales with the text, like an emoji or font. Finally position the icon where you want with background-position.I've used this for my external links (a[href*=\"://\"]:after), and it's worked fine in Firefox, Chrome, and iOS. And since the icon remains a text element, even direct text after it binds, so any closing punctuation will wrap too.I was having the same issue. I didn't really like the idea of adding strong or span tags to the last word, so I tried simply adding the icon as a background image with some padding-right instead of using the :after or :before pseudo elements. Worked for me!http://jsfiddle.net/atcJJ/36/If using an icon font: Using the \"non-breaking space\" unicode \\00a0 along with the pseudo-element content (in this case a Font Awesome glyph).This works without any extra mark-up or special formatting or classnames.The line-height: 0; part keeps the lines from twitching when the last 'word + icon' wrap.CodePen examplePlease make sure you end the  tag before Try the below css. Instead of using \"after\" use \"before\" and float right.Please check this:\nhttp://jsfiddle.net/supriti/atcJJ/7/I was attempting this with a link button and had the most success with adding padding to the right of the element as @Hugo Silva suggested, then setting the ::after to absolute position.

Any additional insights?The ::content pseudo-element is being replaced in future implementations of Web Components / Shadow DOM with the ::slotted pseudo-element. Likewise, the element targeted by this pseudo-element has changed from <content to <slot> in the latest version of the Shadow DOM specification. You can see related discussion about that change here.Currently browsers still support <content> and ::content.\nSummary:::content is essentially a way to dig deeper and style descendants of the ShadowHost, which normally aren't available to be styled, because your CSS doesn't know to look for the ShadowDOM fragment without ::content.This answer assumes you are at least somewhat familiar with the <template> element and Web Components, specifically the ShadowDOM, which deals with ShadowTrees and their two main elements, ShadowHost and ShadowRoot.Note - As of this writing, there is less than 50% support (even prefixed, off-by-default support) for Web Components across the five major browsers. While all modern browsers support <template>, only recent versions of Chrome and Opera support the ShadowDOM fully; with Firefox supporting parts of it after you toggle the requisite feature in about:config (dom.webcomponents.enabled) to true. The goal of using the ShadowDOM is similar to MVC's separation of concerns. That is, we want to separate our content from our presentation and allow for encapsulated templates in our code to help make it more manageable. We have this already in various programming languages, but it's remained a problem for some time in HTML and CSS. Further, there can be conflicts with class names when styling elements in web apps. Normally, we interact with the LightDOM (a sort of \"Light Realm\"), but sometimes it would be helpful to take advantage of encapsulation. Crossing into this sort of \"Shadow Realm\" (part of Web Components) is a new method to prevent the problems mentioned above by allowing encapsulation. Any styles applied to markup in your ShadowTree won't apply to markup outside of your ShadowTree, even if the exact same classes or selectors are used. When the ShadowTree (which lives in the ShadowDOM) has a tree from the LightDOM distributed within it, and/or when the ShadowTree is rendered, the result is converted by the browser into what is called a composed tree. When the browser renders your code, content is being distributed and inserted at new locations other than where it was physically typed. This distributed output is what you see (and what the browser sees), and is called the composed tree. In reality, the content is not originally typed in the order that it now appears, but you won't know this, and neither will the browser. This separation between \"end result\" and \"original code\", if you will, is one of the main benefits of encapsulation.Web Components & the Future of CSS is a great 40-minute video on Web Components and specifically the ShadowDOM, pointed out to me by ZachSaucier.Specific to your question, the ::content pseudo element applies to what are called distributed nodes. A distributed node is another term for whatever you put within the <content></content> tags. The content is distributed from its place in the original markup to wherever you have placed your <content> tags in the template.So, when you need specificity in CSS, one way you can handle selectors normally is that you go to the parent element and add that in as part of the selector. Ex: if .container {} is not specific enough, you might use div .container {} or .main .container {} in order to make your selector work.Thinking about the point of the ShadowDOM, which is scoping and encapsulation, you have to realize that this new ShadowTree you've created is a completely new (discrete) DOM fragment. It's not in the same \"Light Realm\" as the rest of your content; it's in a \"Shadow Realm\". So, how does the CSS know to target this \"Shadow Realm\"? By using the ::content pseudo-element! HTML5Rocks has a great sequence of tutorials here, here, and here which cover more information and give some great examples (be sure to visit with Chrome or Opera until more browsers support these features).For example, see this modified and improved (by Leo) version of the code from HTML5Rocks:Also available on JSFiddle (Remember to visit in a WebKit-based browser like Chrome or Opera)Here you can see that the ::contentsection p pseudo element is first selecting the content of the ShadowRoot, which is the contents of the div element in your markup, and then specifying further by adding section p. This may seem unnecessary when compared to normal CSS selector usage (for example, why not just use section p {}?), until you recall that, when traversing a ShadowTree, you cannot normally select descendants of host elements (which distributed nodes are), because they are in the \"Shadow Realm\" I mentioned earlier. Too bad! Unfortunately ::content is v0, and was deprecated.You should now use the v1 ::slotted.Also, <content> was deprecated in favor of <slot>.Please see: http://hayato.io/2016/shadowdomv1/Also see: Web Components - why <content> was replaced with <slot>"},

It includes multiple shadow support.jQuery animates by changing the style property of DOM elements, which can cause surprises with specificity and moves style information out of your stylesheets. I can't find browser support stats for CSS shadow animation, but you might consider using jQuery to apply an animation-based class instead of handling the animation directly. For example, you can define a box-shadow animation in your stylesheet:You can then use the native animationend event to synchronise the end of the animation with what you were doing in your JS code:If you are using jQuery 1.4.3+ then you can take advantage of the cssHooks code that was added.By using the boxShadow hook: https://github.com/brandonaaron/jquery-cssHooks/blob/master/boxshadow.jsYou can do something like this:The hook doesn't let you animate the color yet but I am sure with some work that could be added.Example: http://jsfiddle.net/petersendidit/w5aAn/If you don't want to use a plugin, it can be done with a bit of CSS:Check it out: http://jsfiddle.net/Z8E5U/If you want full documentation on CSS animations, your path to wizardry begins here..I love the ShaneSauce solution !\nUse a class intead of an ID and you can add/remove the effect to any element using jQuery addClass/delay/removeClass :Here is an example of how to do it without a plugin: jQuery animated Box  But it doesn't have the extra functionality that comes with the use of a plugin, but I personally like to see (and understand) the method behind the madness."},

Should make it easier for you to position it correctly if it only has to work within one specific browser.I ran into this problem myself.  I found that not specifying an input height, but using the font-height and padding combined, results in vertically aligned text.For instance, lets say you want to have a 42px tall input box, with a font-size of 20px.  You could simply find the difference between the input height and the font-size, divide it by two, and set your padding to that amount.  In this case, you would have 22px total worth of padding, which is 11px on each side.That would give you a 42px tall input box with perfect vertical alignment.Hope that helps.I've not tried this myself, but try setting:Where 36px is the height of your input.I know I'm late to the party but hopefully this'll help anyone looking for a concise answer that does work across all major browsers (except IE6, we have decided to stop supporting that browser so I refuse to even look at it anymore).cheers!\nJPIn my opinion, the answer on this page with the most votes is the best answer, but his math was wrong and I couldn't comment on it.I needed a text input box to be exactly 40 pixels high including a 1 pixel border all the way around.  Of course I wanted the text vertically aligned in the center in all browsers.1 pixel border top\n1 pixel border bottom\n8 pixel top padding\n8 pixel bottom padding\n22 pixel font size1 + 1 + 8 + 8 + 22 = 40 pixels exactly.One thing to remember is that you must remove your css height property or those pixels will get added to your total above.This is working in Firefox, Chrome, IE 8, and Safari.  I can only assume that if something simple like this is working in IE8, it should work similarly in 6, 7, and 9 but I have not tested it. Please let me know and I'll edit this post accordingly.this is correct way to set vertical-middle position.After much searching and frustration a combo of setting height, line height and no padding worked for me when using a fixed height (24px) background image for a text input field.Try :Because on some versions of IE (< 9) the property height is not properly interpreted.Go for line-height.The vertical-align tag works fine for the submit button but not for the text in the input field.\nSetting line-height to the height of the input field works on all browsers. Incl IE7.Just don't set the height of the input box, only set the font-size, that will be okThis is how I do it.then inside your CSS file,  That should work for you.Late to the party, but the current answers won't work if you have box-sizing: border-box set (which a lot of people do for form elements these days).Just reset the box sizing for IE8 to box-sizing: content-box; then use one of the padding / height answer.The inner vertical alignment will depend on font height and input height, so, it can be adjusted using padding !!! Try some like :...Remember to adjust the values on css class according to your needs !Sorry in advance the simple answer...Just remove your title text and use the input placeholder for your label's title. Some visual and css work after that and your form will be looking tight and user friendly. I'm aware of the disadvantages but this will completely relieve the alignment wrestling.

Asking if there is a second way to do that is sort of asking if there is a second standard.Doing it through scripts will still have the same issue as once the page is loaded, the script would have been run and the email address rendered in the DOM (unless you populate the email address on click or something). Either way, screen readers will still have issues with this since it's not already loaded.Honestly, just get an email service with a half decent spam filter and specify a default subject line that is easy for you to sort in your inbox.What you're asking for is if the standard has two ways to do something, one for bots and the other for non-bots. The answer is it doesn't, and you have to just fight the bots as best you can.Defeating email bots is a tough one. You may want to check out the Email Address Harvesting countermeasures section on Wikipedia.My back-story is that I've written a search bot. It crawled 105,000+ URLs during it's initial run many years ago. From what I've learned from doing that is that web crawling bots literally see EVERYTHING that is text, which appears on a web page. Bots read everything except images.Spam can't be easily stopped via code for these reasons:I don't think it's possible to stop 100% of spam while using traditional email servers, without using filters on the email server and possibly using images.There is one alternative... You can also build a chat-like email client, which runs internally on a website. It would be like Facebook's chat client. It's \"kind of like email\", but not really email. It's simply 1-to-1 instant messaging with an archiving feature... that auto-loads upon login. Since it has document attachment + link features, it works kind of like email... but without the spam. As long as you don't build an externally accessible API, then it's a closed system where people can't send spam into it.If you're planning to stick with strictly traditional email, then your best bet may be to run something like Apache's SpamAssassin on a company's email server. You can also try combining multiple strategies as you've listed above, to make it harder for email harvesters to glean email addresses from your web pages. They won't stop 100% of the spam, 100% of the time... while also allowing 100% of the screen readers to work for blind visitors. You've created a really good starting look at what's wrong with traditional email! Kudos to you for that!A good screen reader is JAWS from Freedom Scientific. I've used that before to listen to how my webpages are read by blind users. (If you hear a male voice reading both actions [like clicking on a link] & text, try changing 1 voice to female so that 1 voice reads actions & another reads text. That makes it easier to hear how the web page is read for the visually impared.)Good luck with your Email Address Harvesting countermeasure endeavours!Here is an approach that does make use of JavaScript, but with a rather small foot-print. It's also very \"ghetto\", and generally I would not recommend an approach with inline JS in the HTML except you have an extreme reluctance to use JS, at all.data-contact is the base64 encoded email address. And, data-subj is an optional base64 encoded subject.The main challenge with doing this without JS is that CSS can't alter HTML attributes. (The article you linked is a \"pie-in-the-sky\" musing and does not have any bearing on what is possible today or in the near future.)The HTML entities approach you mentioned, or some variation of it, is likely the simplest option that will have some efficacy. Additionally, the iframe approach is clever and the server redirect approach is pretty awesome. But, all three are vulnerable to bots:With the approach outlined above, the use of a base64 encoded email address in a data-contact attribute is very \"one-off\" – as long as the scrapper is not specifically designed for your site, it should work. Simple + Lot of @ + Editable without toolsHave you considered using google's recaptcha mailhide? \nhttps://www.google.com/recaptcha/admin#mailhideThe idea is that when a user clicks the checkbox (see nocaptcha below), the full e-mail address is displayed.While recaptcha is traditionally not only hard for screen readers but also humans as well, with the roleout of google's nocaptcha recaptcha which you can read about\n here as they relate to accessibility tests. It appears to show promise with regards to screen readers as it renders as a traditional checkbox from their view.\nExample #1 - Not secure but for easy illustration of the ideaHere is some code as an example without using mailhide but implementing something using recaptcha yourself: https://jsfiddle.net/43fad8pf/36/Note: In my example I have the e-mail in a javascript function. Ideally you would have the recaptcha validated on the server end, and return the e-mail, otherwise the bot can simply get it in the code.Example #2 - Server side validation and returning of e-mailIf we use an example more like this, we get additional security: https://designracy.com/recaptcha-using-ajax-php-and-jquery/Where verify.php is:People who write scrapers want to make their scrapers as efficient as possible. Therefore, they won't download styles, scripts, and other external resources. There's no method that I know of to set a mailto link using CSS. In addition, you specifically said you didn't want to set the link using Javascript.If you think about what other types of resources there are, there's also external documents (i.e. HTML documents using iframes). Almost no scrapers would bother downloading the contents of iframes. Therefore, you can simply do:index.html:frame.html:To human users, the iframe looks just like normal text. Iframes are inline and transparent by default, so we just need set its border and dimensions. You can't make the size of the iframe match its content's size without using Javascript, so the best we can do is giving it predefined dimensions.First, I don't think doing anything with CSS will work. All bots (except Google's crawler) simply ignore all styling on websites. Any solution has to work with JS or server-side.A server-side solution could be making an <a> that links to a new tab, which simply redirects to the desired mailto:That's all my ideas for now. Hope it helps.Short answer to fulfill all your requirements is that it's impossibleSome of the script-based options answered here may work for certain bots, but you wanted no-script, so, no, you can't. The one method I found effective is using it with css like below:<a href=\"mailto:myemail@ignore-domain.com\">myemail@<span style=\"display:none;\">ignore-</span>domain.comand then write a javascript to remove the ignoreme- word from the href=\"mailto:...\" attribute with regex. This will hide email from bot as it will append ignore- word before real domain and this will work on screen reader and when user clicks on the link custom js function will remove the ignore- word from href attribute so it will open the real email.This method has been working very effectively for me till date. you can read more on this - http://techblog.tilllate.com/2008/07/20/ten-methods-to-obfuscate-e-mail-addresses-compared/"},

There doesn't need to be, when you can just use :not(:hover). The whole point of the :not() pseudo-class is to allow authors to write negations without having to specify separate negations of every existing (and future) dynamic pseudo-class where an element can only either match or not match the pseudo-class.For example, only some elements can either be :enabled or :disabled — most elements are neither because the semantics simply don't apply — but an element can only either be designated by the pointing device (:hover), or not (:not(:hover)). Providing negations that can already directly be achieved using :not() would greatly undermine its usefulness (though it could still be used to negate any other simple selector — or entire complex selectors down the road).The argument that such a pseudo-class would be computationally less expensive is pretty weak. The most naïve implementation of such a pseudo-class would be a literal :not(:hover) check, which would be no better. Any more complex or optimized implementations and you're asking vendors to implement a pseudo-class that is either as fast as or even faster than :not(:hover), something that's already uncommon enough of a use case considering the other options you have such as cascading and :not(:hover) (for whenever cascading isn't an option) that you readily have access to. It simply doesn't justify the time and effort to spec, implement and test an alternative to at least one other existing method that is 100% functionally equivalent (and one that applies to at least 80% of scenarios). And there's also the issue of naming such a pseudo-class — you haven't proposed a name for it, and I can't think of a good one either. :not-hover is only shorter by two bytes and only marginally less work to type. If anything, it's potentially more confusing than :not(:hover).If you are worried about specificity, note that the :not() pseudo-class itself is not counted for specificity; only its most specific argument is. :not(:hover) and :hover are equally specific. So specificity is not an issue either.If you are worried about browser support, such a pseudo-class, if introduced, would likely have either been introduced alongside :not(), or in a later level of Selectors, since it didn't appear in CSS2 (where :hover was first introduced more than 17 years ago, and first implemented in IE4 another year yet before). Introducing it in a later level would be pointless because authors would simply be forced to continue using :not(:hover) until browsers begin implementing this new pseudo-class anyway, and they would have no reason to switch.Note that this isn't the same as the following question, which talks about events vs states (it's originally about :focus rather than :hover, but the same principle applies): Does CSS have a :blur selector (pseudo-class)?is a normal (non hovered link)is a hovered link"},

In CSS letter-spacing is the equivalent property for \"tracking\".Given a value for tracking, how do you express this as a value for CSS in pixels?Do you have to use pixels?  The conversions I found is a tracking value of 1000 is equal to 1 em in CSS, so in your case tracking 100 should be 0.1 em.EDITTo go from EM to pixels use this site PXtoEM.com.  For your specific case 0.1 em converts to 2px.  However this is based on a 16pt font, so you will have to adjust for the specific font size you're using.TL;DR: divide the tracking by 1000 and use em'sA bit of background about letter-spacing is always applied to text so we should use a relative unit of length. As font-size can change by the user or even by cascade.The best unit of length for text is the em unit.Why is tracking different?Layout apps such as Adobe's Photoshop, Illustrator and InDesign use em's in their tracking but manipulate the unit so it's an easier number for designers to play with. To make it easier they times it by 1000.Converting tracking back to whole em'sTo do this we just need to divide the tracking number by 1000 to get the unit back to a whole em that CSS can use.So 50/1000 = 0.05em.Calculating this in CSS/SCSSIf you are using SCSS and want a reusable solution - here is a mixin.To use the above functions you can just do this.Alternatively you can just to the maths inline without a mixin so it's less abstracted:The output for the above examples will be:Note:\nYou should not use a pixel based value as pixels are fixed and break when:Additionally browsers render text different to how the graphic design programs do so don't be surprised if the designer tweaks the tracking/letter-spacing on review of the implementation.Tracking Conversion CSS “letter-spacing”For the most part the above answers are accurate enough, however, the 1000 that's being used assumes your font has an Em Size of 1000, and that's not always the case. I've seen fonts that have an Em Size of 1024, and some that were even 2048, which is obviously going to have an impact.You can find out a font's Em Size by opening it inside of something like Font Forge and then selecting the Elements -> Font Info menu item, and the General tab.If you have a font size in pixels you can use the following formula:tracking * font-size / 1000 = letter-spacing"},

I am using the SASS part of Bootstrap.Twitter Bootstrap uses LESS as far as I've seen. On the other hand, !default is actually part of Sass, and is used for giving Sass variables ($var) default values, which would make it invalid in your given context, even in Sass.Besides, I've not been able to find any references to !default in the LESS documentation, and to my knowledge it is exclusive to Sass. Are you sure you found this in Bootstrap's source and not elsewhere? Because I honestly don't remember seeing Sass/SCSS code in Bootstrap's stylesheets.For what it's worth, the only valid token that starts with ! in CSS is !important, which you may already be aware of.!default is used often in Bootstrap Sass. It is similar to a reverse !important. All of Bootstraps Variables are set using !default to allow the developer to further customize bootstrap. With !default sass will only define a variable if it has not already been set.This allows for more flexibility. So Why is this important? \nBootstrap is a package. Most people don't edit the Bootstrap source. NEVER UPDATE THE BOOTSTRAP SOURCE. To customize bootstrap you will add your own variable file and compile it with the bootstrap code but never touch the native bootstrap package. Bootstrap sass's page has the full skinny on how to customize and compile it in the documentations.I don't know why less does not do this. I have not worked much with less and do not know if it has it's own built in variable management. Example fiddle\nhttps://jsfiddle.net/siggysid/344dnnwz/You can find the following exact definition and a decent explanation in sass-lang website in its doc section (variable) - default value:Normally when you assign a value to a variable, if that variable already had a value, its old value is overwritten. But if you’re writing a Sass library, you might want to allow your users to configure your library’s variables before you use them to generate CSS.\nTo make this possible, Sass provides the !default flag. This assigns a value to a variable only if that variable isn’t defined or its value is null. Otherwise, the existing value will be used."},

UPDATE: As this answer is still getting votes both up and down, and is at the time of writing eight years old: There are probably better techniques out there now. Original answer follows below.Clearly you are looking for the Faux columns technique :-)By how the height-property is calculated, you can't set height: 100% inside something that has auto-height. This worked for meUntil CSS's flexbox becomes more mainstream, you can always just absolutely position the sidebar, sticking it zero pixels away from the top and bottom, then set a margin on your main container to compensate.JSFiddlehttp://jsfiddle.net/QDCGv/HTMLCSSNote: This is an über simple way to do this but you'll find bottom does not mean \"bottom of page,\" but \"bottom of window.\" The sidebar will probably abrubtly end if your main content scrolls down.I would use css tables to achieve a 100% sidebar height. The basic idea is to wrap the sidebar and main divs in a container.Give the container a display:tableAnd give the 2 child divs (sidebar and main) a display: table-cellLike so..Take a look at this LIVE DEMO where I have modified your initial markup using the above technique  (I have used background colors for the different divs so that you can see which ones are which)Flexbox (http://caniuse.com/#feat=flexbox)First wrap the columns you want in a div or section, ex:Then add the following CSS:Further to @montrealmike 's answer, can I just add my adaptation?I did this:I did the \"101%\" thing to cater for the (ultra rare) possibility that somebody may be viewing the site on a huge screen with a height more than 5000px!Great answer though, montrealmike. It worked perfectly for me.I have run into this issue several times on different projects, but I have found a solution that works for me. You have to use four div tags - one that contains the sidebar, the main content, and a footer. First, style the elements in your stylesheet:You can edit the different elements however you want to, just be sure you dont change the footer property \"clear:both\" - this is very important to leave in.

So I made some adjustments...Important:Here's the css:And here's the html:I realise this is an old post but I was trying to work something out for my site to have a sidebar.\nWould this work?I think your solution would be to wrap your content container and your sidebar in a parent containing div. Float your sidebar to the left and give it the background image. Create a wide margin at least the width of your sidebar for your content container. Add clearing a float hack to make it all work.use body background if you are using fixed width sidebar give the same width image as your side bar. also put background-repeat:repeat-y in your css codes.Position absolute, top:0 and bottom:0 for the sidebar and position relative for the wrapper (or container) witch content all the elements and it's done !Try this.

It also collapses the borders though so this might not be 100% what you wantThe question asked for a CSS solution, but on the off-chance an HTML solution will do, here is one:Try adding these two attributes to the table element:     frame=\"box\" rules=\"all\"\nlike this:I just found the following. It's standards compliant but it doesn't work in IE. sigh.I happened across this question and haven't seen any answers that really addressed the issue.The problem results because IE7 does not see any internal content for the cell; in programming terms the cell is resulting as a null and like most things, you cannot border a null or perform any action on it.  The browser needs an element/object that has a layout, in order to apply a border/layout.Even empty <div></div> or <span></span> do not contain content, thus there is nothing to render, resulting in that null case again.However, you can trick the browser into thinking the cell has content, by giving the empty div/span layout properties.  The easiest way is to apply the CSS style zoom:1.This workaround is better than using a &nbsp;, since it doesn't unnecessarily mess up screen readers, and isn't misrepresenting the value of the cell.  In newer browser you can use the empty-cell:<show|hide> alternative.Note: in lieu of Tomalak's comment, it should be understood that hasLayout has nothing to do with null, it was merely a comparison of how the browser interacts and renders hasLayout similarly to how a database or programming language interacts with nulls.  It is a strech, but I thought it might be easier to understand for those programmers turned web designers.Ideally, you shouldn't have any empty cells in a table. Either you have a table of data, and there's no data in that specific cell (which you should indicate with \"-\", or \"n/a/\", or something equally appropriate, or - if you must - &nbsp;, as suggested), or you have a cell that needs to span a column or row, or you're trying to achieve some layout with a table that you should be using CSS for.Can we have a bit more detail?This question's old, but still a top result in Google, so I'll add what I've found:Simply adding border-collapse: collapse to the table style fixed this problem for me in IE7 (and didn't affect the way they're displayed in FF, Chrome, etc).Best to avoid the extraneous code of adding an &nbsp; or other spacing element when you can fix with CSS.I guess this can't be done with CSS;\nYou need to put a &nbsp; in every empty cell for the border to show in IE...empty-cell only fixed Firefox (YES I really did have this issue in Firefox) IE 7 & 8 were still problematic..This worked for me in both Firefox 3.6.x, IE 7 & 8, Chrome, and Safari:============================================================Had to use the * to make sure the table style was only applied to the IE browser.Try this if you can't use non-breakable space:I create a div style that has the same font color as the background of your cell and write anything (usually a \"-\" \"n/a\" or \"empty\") to give the cell content. It shows up if you highlight the page, but when viewed normally looks how you want.I use a mix of html and css to create cross browser table grids:html<table cellspacing=\"1\" style=\"background-color:#000;\" border=\"0\">cssI haven't seen any issues with any browsers so far.\"IE\" isn't a useful term in this context anymore now that IE8 is out.IE7 always does \"empty-cells:show\" (or so I'm told ... Vista).\nIE8 in any of its \"Quirks\" or \"IE7 Standards\" modes always does \"empty-cells:hide\".\nIE8 in \"Standards\" mode defaults to \"empty-cells:show\" and supports the attribute via CSS.As far as I know, every other browser has correctly supported this for several years (I know it was added in Firefox 2).I'm taking this from another website but:Use for the CSS for the table and TD element respectively."},

You probably finally realized this between posting this question and today, but the very nature of selectors makes it impossible to navigate through hierarchically unrelated HTML elements.Or, to put it simply, since you said in your comment that... it's just not possible with selectors alone, without modifying the markup in some way as shown by the other answers.You have to use the jQuery .eq() solution.use nth-child(item number)\nEXOR:nth-of-type(item number)\nsame your codeYes, you can do this.  For example, to style the td tags that make up the different columns of a table you could do something like this:This isn't so much an answer as a non-answer, i.e. an example showing why one of the highly voted answers above is actually wrong.I thought that answer looked good. In fact, it gave me what I was looking for: :nth-of-type which, for my situation, worked. (So, thanks for that, @Bdwey.)I initially read the comment by @BoltClock (which says that the answer is essentially wrong) and dismissed it, as I had checked my use case, and it worked. Then I realized @BoltClock had a reputation of 300,000+(!) and has a profile where he claims to be a CSS guru. Hmm, I thought, maybe I should look a little closer.Turns out as follows: div.myclass:nth-of-type(2) does NOT mean \"the 2nd instance of div.myclass\". Rather, it means \"the 2nd instance of div, and it must also have the 'myclass' class\". That's an important distinction when there are intervening divs between your div.myclass instances.It took me some time to get my head around this. So, to help others figure it out more quickly, I've written an example which I believe demonstrates the concept more clearly than a written description: I've hijacked the h1, h2, h3 and h4 elements to essentially be divs. I've put an A class on some of them, grouped them in 3's, and then colored the 1st, 2nd and 3rd instances blue, orange and green using h?.A:nth-of-type(?). (But, if you're reading carefully, you should be asking \"the 1st, 2nd and 3rd instances of what?\"). I also interjected a dissimilar (i.e. different h level) or similar (i.e. same h level) un-classed element into some of the groups.Note, in particular, the last grouping of 3. Here, an un-classed h3 element is inserted between the first and second h3.A elements. In this case, no 2nd color (i.e. orange) appears, and the 3rd color (i.e. green) shows up on the 2nd instance of h3.A. This shows that the n in h3.A:nth-of-type(n) is counting the h3s, not the h3.As.Well, hope that helps. And thanks, @BoltClock.Perhaps using the \"~\" selector of CSS?See my example on jsfiddle"},

Sometimes it is very boring to have to zoom out to see all the content. For example when you type on an input on iOS it zooms to get it in the center of the screen. You have to zoom out after that cause closing the keyboard does not do the work. Also I agree that when you put many I hours in making a great layout and user experience you don't want it to be messed up by a zoom. But the other argument is valuable as well for people with vision issues. However In my opinion if you have issues with your eyes you are already using the zooming features of the system so there is no need to disturb the content. Unfortunately, the offered solution doesn't work in Safari 10+, since Apple has decided to ignore user-scalable=no.

That approach also means you can keep things accessible for users who aren't on a normal web browser-- just hide your ul by default and show the radio buttons.I know this is an old question, but since I was just looking to do this, I thought I would post what I ended up with.

There is text-overflow:ellipsis; and word-wrap: break-word; but they are IE only (break-word is in the CSS3 draft, however, so it will be the solution to this 5 years from now).Bottom line is that if it is very important for you to stop this from happening with wrapping the text over to the next line the only reasonable solution is to inject  &shy; (soft hyphen), <wbr> (word break tag), or &#8203; (zero-width space, same effect as &shy; minus hyphen) in your string server side. If you don't mind Javascript, however, there is the hyphenator which seems to be pretty solid.word-wrap: break-word; is available in IE7+, FF 3.5 and Webkit enabled browsers (Safari/Chrome etc). To handle IE6 you will also need to declare word-wrap: break-all;If FF 2.0 is not on your browser matrix then using these is a viable solution. Unfortunately it does not hyphenate the preceding line where the word is broken which is a typographical nightmare. I would suggest using the Hyphenator as suggested by Paolo which is unobtrusive JavaScript. The fall-back for non JavaScript enabled users will then be the broken word without hyphens. I can live with that for the time being. This problem will most likely arise in a CMS, where the web designer does not have control over what content will be entered or where line-breaks and soft-hyphens may be implemented.I have taken a look at the W3 specification where hyphenation in CSS3 is discussed. Unfortunately it appears there are a few suggestions but nothing concrete yet. It appears the browser vendors are yet to implement anything either yet. I have checked both Mozilla and Webkit for proprietory code but there is no sign of any.word-break:break-all works a treatJust mentioned this over here but probably more relevant to this question. The best property shortly will be overflow-wrap. and the best value if it gets implemented would be:Doesen't seem to be supported in any way just yet at the time of writing on the iphone or firefox, and overflow-wrap:hyphenate isn't even in the working draft. in the meantime i'd use:I use the code for preventing all long strings, urls and so on..Hopefully someday we'll get access to the word-wrap property in CSS3: Force Wrapping: the 'word-wrap' property.Someday...Normally Cells will do this naturally, but you could force this behavior on a div with:Always specify line-height property - if you don't specify, it might cause the failure of your word-break: break-all; property.It seems that this does the trick for latest Chrome:I have not checked any browsers but Chrome."},

A good trick with the original HTML from the OP is to add a CSS rule like this:Poof!  Now (without my additional <div>) it works fine! Well, except for that extra pixel from the borders. In particular, I think it's a combination of the way that clear: both works and the margin collapse rules that result in the unexpected layout from the code in the OP.edit again — For the complete (and, I think, completely accurate) story, see Mark Amery's excellent answer. The details have some complexity that this answer glosses over.While Pointy shows how you can wrap the floats in a div, alternatively you can insert an empty div between the floats and the main data section. For example:This might prove useful in cases where adding a div wrapper around some HTML is not desirable.The logic behind this in the spec is mind-bending, and involves a complicated interaction of the rules for clearance and collapsing margins.You're probably familiar with the conventional CSS box model, in which the content box is contained within a padding box contained within a border box contained within a margin box:For elements with clear set to something other than none, an additional component may be introduced to this model: clearance.In other words, the box model in those cases really looks more like this:But when is clearance introduced, and how big should it be? Let's start with the first of those questions. The spec says:Let's apply this logic to the question asker's code. Remember, we're trying to explain the position of the third div in the code below (backgrounds added to aid in visualisation):Let us imagine, as the spec asks us to, that clear is set to none on the third div, instead of both. Then what would the snippet above look like?Here, the third div is overlapping the two floated divs. But wait; why is this so? Sure, it's allowable for floated elements to overlap block-level ones (per the Floats spec, \"Since a float is not in the flow, non-positioned block boxes created before and after the float box flow vertically as if the float did not exist.\"), but our third div has loads of margin-top on it, and comes after the two floated divs; shouldn't the two floated divs appear at the top of the body, and the third div appear 200px down, well below them?The reason this doesn't occur is that the margin of the third div collapses into the margin of the divs' parent (in this case, the body - but the same behaviour happens if you wrap all three divs in a parent div). The Collapsing margins spec (quoted below with several irrelevant details omitted) tells us that:The third div in our example certainly isn't the body's first child, but it is its first in-flow child. Note that per https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS22/visuren.html#positioning-scheme:Since the first and second div in our example are floated, only the third div is in-flow. Thus its top margin adjoins the top margin of its parent, and the margins collapse - pushing down the entire body, including the two floated elements. Thus the third div overlaps its siblings despite having a large margin-top. Consequently - in this hypothetical case, where the third element's clear is set to none - we satisfy the condition that:Thus:How much clearance? The spec gives browsers two options, with a couple of clarifying notes:Before we can start applying these rules, we immediately hit a complication. Remember that collapsing margin that we had to take into account in the hypothetical case where clear was none? Well, it doesn't exist in this non-hypothetical case where we're calculating the clearance to use, because the existence of the clearance inhibits it. Recall the collapsing margin rules from 8.3.1, quoted earlier, dictate that margins are only adjoining if:(emphasis added). As such, the third div's top margin and the top margin of its parent are no longer adjoining. We can simulate this pre-clearance scenario in our example snippet by keeping clear: none but adding padding-top: 1px to the body, which also disables margin collapse, per the rule quoted above.Now, unlike when the margins were collapsed, our third div is comfortably below its two floated siblings. But we have already decided, based upon a hypothetical scenario where the margins did collapse, that clearance must be added; all that remains is to choose the amount of clearance, in order to:And so we have no choice but to apply a negative clearance to the third div, in order to drag its top border edge up to touch the bottom outer edge (also known as margin edge) of the floated elements above it. As such, if the floated elements are each 10px high and the third div has 200px of top margin, -190px of clearance will be applied. That, at last, gets us to the final result seen by the question asker:(Note that if you inspect the third div in the snippet above using your browser's dev tools, you will still be able to see the 200px of top margin above the div, going way out above all the rest of the content - it's just that the entire margin box has been hauled upwards by the large negative clearance.)Simple!Pointy and Randall Cook have excellent answers.  I thought I'd show one more solution.  If you make the 3rd element \"float: left;\" AND \"clear: both;\", it should have the desired effect of giving the 3rd element a 200 pixel margin.  Here's a link to an example.This also might affect other followup elements as to whether they need to be floats or not.  However, it might also have the desired effect.Alternative solution:http://jsfiddle.net/9EY4R/Note: Having made this suggestion I have to immediately retract it as not generally a good idea, but in some limited situations may appropriate;The panel with items is called order-details with this cssIn the above fiddle - the yellow panel has a margin-top, but unless it is greater than the tallest floated item then it won't do anything (of course that's the whole point of this question).If you set the margin-top of the yellow panel to 20em then it will be visible because the margin is calculated from the top of the outer blue box.Use 'padding-top' in your main data div instead. Or, alternatively, wrap the main data div in one with 'padding-top'.Try setting a bottom margin on one of the floated elements. Alternatively, you can wrap the floats in a parent element, and use a css hack to clear it without additional markup.Sometimes a combination of position relative and margin can solve these type of problems.I use this technique for my alignright and alignleft classes in WordPress.For instance if I want a \"bottom margin\" that is respected by clearing elements you can use.For your example you could do something like "},

So, the borders look funny because the background is repeated on each side outside the padding-box to cover the border-box.The box-shadow:inset is rendered inside the padding-box (just like background) and gives visually the same effect as a border, so you could try using that in place of border:Because a box-shadow doesn't take up any space, you need to increase your padding accordingly.Illustration of padding-box and border-box:\nDemo http://jsfiddle.net/ilpo/fzndodgx/5/The simplest way to fix this issue would be by setting the value for the background-origin property as border-box .The following are the relevant background properties that determine the way the background gradient is displayed for this case:Now combining all three we can see that the border must be repeated as much as possible for it to be present even under the borders and that it's starting position is after the border of the box. This implies that the background must be repeated in a cyclic manner so as to fill up the area under the border on the left side. Because of this the left border has the color as the right end of the gradient and vice-versa.By changing it to border-box, we are making the background get positioned with respect to the border box.  This setting also has an effect on the size of the background image and the reason for it is described below in detail.Setting box-sizing as border-box does not bring about any change because that property affects only the size of the box. It has absolutely no effect on the following:As per W3C spec, the below is how the image's dimensions are calculated when no explicit size is provided (default value is auto).Note how it talks about the size of the image and not that of the box. In essence, irrespective of the size of the box, the size of the background image would be calculated based on the definition for keyword contain when the image itself has no intrinsic height (which CSS gradients don't have unlike images). The definition for contain is as follows: Background positioning area is defined as follows (under background-origin property definition):Thus, when the image has no intrinsic height (and in this case no background-size also), the size of the image would be equal to that of background-origin's value (which in our case is padding-box). This is why even setting the box-sizing as border-box has no effect.Note: emphasis within the quoted texts are all mineIf you explicitly set the background-size as the size of the box, you would notice how the issue is resolved on the right side but not on the left side. This is because now the image is large enough to not repeat under the right border but its starting point is still after the left border.The background is repeating itself under the border. The background runs only in the \"body\" of the element, under the border is an expansion and repeat starts occurring.See this example with no-repeat on the border.UPDATEPlaying with background position & size can help by expanding the background and then adjusting it's location.Check this fiddle out.Or see snippet:The gradient starts within the padding box according to the default CSS box model behaviour, so it makes sense that the very start and very end colours appear until infinity either side of the gradient, where the border would be.The same is true of this gradient (NSFW):It continues infinitely in the starting value (violet) to the left, and continues infinitely with the end value (orange) to the right. It can continue infinitely upwards with this gradient, and so it does.That's my understanding of why this is appearing so, a solution would to use a different box model.The default value of background-origin property is padding-box which means the background is positioned and sized relative to the padding box.The background also extends below border since the background-clip property defaults to border-box; it simply repeats itself below the border. This is why you see the right side of background below left border and vice versa.So, just change the origin:Alternately you can play with background size and position: add 20px to the background size and position it at -10px -10px:Other answers have already shown how to fix the issue, but I thought I should just point out that if you increase the border-width it becomes apparent that the background is actually repeating.will produceIf you don't want to use box-shadow, you could use border-image and adjust the colors of the gradient: http://jsfiddle.net/9pcuj8bw/5/Careful this works not on IE10 or lower: http://caniuse.com/#feat=border-image"},

As an added bonus, not only can you adjust the thickness of the strikeout, but you can control its color separately from the text color:Use RGBa colors to make the strikeout semi-transparent:Or even make the strikeout a gradient! Just use a background combined with a height, in place of a border:This works in IE9 (sans gradient) and up – or even IE8 if you use the single-colon :after syntax and manually write the negative margin-top value instead of using calc().The main downside is that this only works on a single line of text. But hey, you take what you can get ;-)This seems to be a longstanding question without an ideal solution for multi-line strikethroughs.Conveniently, using CSS gradients, you can easily adjust your line thickness like so:See the demo and full vendor prefixing here: http://codepen.io/pearlchen/pen/dhpxushort answer: no. it depends on the font, it's the same for the thickness of underline—it changes with the thickness of the textI have an idea but it would require adding an additional element for each level of thickness.htmlcssBTW the spaces in the second span are specials - you will have to use alt+0160 or alt+255.\nYou can use pixels unit too on the negative top when ull try to position it precisely.There is another alternative which involve using first text-decoration and then style <strike> or <del> and see if you can nudge it vertically without moving the text with it.htmlcssBoth are working fine here, but remember to use a transitional doctype cause <strike> has been deprecated.No.However, if the strike-through color is the same as the text color, you can easily get away with using a custom image in the background.If you require different colors, then overlaying the custom strike-through image is the only way to go.I realize this is old, but there is a way to do it using nested span tags:Strikethrough is dependent upon the size of the font, so if you double the outer span it will make the line twice as thick.  Then, you need to reduce the inner one by half.  The vertical-align is  necessary or else the line is too high, making it appear to almost be an overline.In action:  http://jsfiddle.net/moodleboy/deep3qw8/Works in Chrome/FF, but not Safari, IE10 or Opera.  Works on Chrome on Mac, but not Windows.I've found another approach for multiline text:http://output.jsbin.com/weqovenopi/1/This approach assumes repeating an image (1px width and npx height). Also it works independent on the font-size.Only one disadvantage - background renders under the text.The line thickness is determined by the font (family, size, etc.).  There is no provision in CSS for changing this http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-CSS1/#text-decorationThis does not answer the question, but is relevant in that it solves the lack of a unique strike-through using scripting. I am not a purist, but I believe this is a x-browser solution.I couldn't find an appropriate method here so I used\nbackground-image with a linear-gradient and ex CSS length units.Unfortunately this means that using different font faces will render the strikethrough in a slightly different position (if the fonts have different x-heights).

However, Private Use code points can be represented as any other Unicode value, e.g. in CSS using a notation like \\f066, as others have answered. You can even enter the code point as such, if your document is UTF-8 encoded and you know how to type an arbitrary Unicode value by its number in your authoring environment (but of course it would normally be displayed using a symbol for an unknown character).However, this is not the normal way of using icon fonts. Normally you use a CSS file provided with the font and use constructs like <span class=\"icon-resize-small\">foo</span>. The CSS code will then take care of inserting the symbol at the start of the element, and you don’t need to know the code point number.At first link fontwaesome CSS file in your HTML file then create an after or before pseudo class like \"font-family: \"FontAwesome\";\n    content: \"\\f101\";\" then save.

I know it's a workaround, but it works. For me I had 4 items per row, so I broke it up into two rows of 4 with each row height: 50%, get rid of flex-grow, have <RowOne /> and <RowTwo /> in a <div> with flex-column. This will do the trickThis seems to be working in cases with fixed parent height (tested in Chrome and Firefox):If it's not possible to use grids for some reason, maybe it's the solution.In your case height will be calculated automatically, so you have to provide the height\nuse this you can do it by fixing the height of \"P\" tag or fixing the height of \"list-item\".I have done by fixing the height of \"P\"and overflow should be hidden.for same height you should chage your css \"display\" Properties.

I hope that by understanding the purpose of collapsing margins, I will understand when to use them and how to avoid them when they are not needed.What is the purpose of this feature?The general meaning of \"margin\" isn't to convey \"move this over by 10px\" but rather, \"there must be 10px of empty space beside this element.\"I've always found this is easiest to conceptualize with paragraphs.If you just gave paragraphs margin-top: 10px and had no margins on any other elements, a series of paragraphs would be spaced beautifully. But of course, you'd run into trouble when placing another element underneath a paragraph. The two would touch.If margins didn't collapse, you'd hesitate to add margin-bottom: 10px to your previous code, because then any pair of paragraphs would get spaced 20px apart, while paragraphs would separate from other elements by only 10px.So vertical margins collapse. By adding top and bottom margins of 10px you're saying, \"I don't care what margin rules any other elements have. I demand at least 10px of padding above and below each of my paragraphs.\" "},

So you need to hard code the height (if you can't hard code the values then you need to use javascript, but this is an entirely different question);You mention that you're using Animate.css, which I'm not familiar with, so this is a vanilla CSS.You can see a demo here: http://jsfiddle.net/duopixel/qD5XX/There are a few answers already, but here is my solution:I use opacity: 0 and visibility: hidden. To make sure that visibility is set before the animation, we have to set the right delays.I use http://lesshat.com to simplify the demo, for use without this just add the browser prefixes.(e.g. -webkit-transition-duration: 0, 200ms;)So as soon as you add the class hidden to your element, it will fade out.I had the same problem, because as soon as display: x; is in animation, it won't animate.I ended up in creating custom keyframes, first changing the display value then the other values. May give a better solution.Or, instead of using display: none; use position: absolute; visibility: hidden; It should work.You can manage to have a pure CSS implementation with max-heightYou might have to also set padding, margin and border to 0, or simply padding-top, padding-bottom, margin-top and margin-bottom.I updated the demo of Duopixel here : http://jsfiddle.net/qD5XX/231/The following will get you to animate an element whenCSSJavaScriptWhen animating height (from 0 to auto), using transform: scaleY(0); is another useful approach to hide the element, instead of display: none;:Here is my solution to the same problem.Moreover I have an onclick on the last frame loading another slideshow, and it must not be clickable until the last frame is visible.Basically my solution is to keep the div 1 pixel high using a scale(0.001), zooming it when I need it. If you don't like the zoom effect you can restore the opacity to 1 after zooming the slide.Other keyframes are removed for the sake of bytes. Please disregard the odd coding, it is made by a php script picking values from an array and str_replacing a template: I'm too lazy to retype everything for every proprietary prefix on a 100+ divs slideshow."},

Inside that function, call console.info(element) on whichever element you'd like to know about.When you run this with firebug active, the element will be available to inspect in the firebug console.You can do this in Firebug but its a little \"buggy\". If you inspect the element and then click off the the html tab, to the DOM tab for instance, when you go back to the html tab the \"style\" css tab on the right will have an arrow drop down selector where you can select the :hover state of that element to be active. Sucks to have to switch tabs to get it to show but it works for me.When inspecting links, Firebug shows the default CSS state, i.e. styles applied to a:link. By default, the :hover and :active styles are not shown. Fortunately, you can change the state of the link by clicking Style and choosing the appropriate option:In firebug, while in the HTML view, look to the right-side panel and find the \"Styles\" tab. Click the down arrow and select :hover.In Firefox (v33.1.1):Some JavaScript toolkits, such as Dojo use CSS classes such as dijitButtonHover to style rather than :hover.So the Style tab :hover trick doesn't work.Instead, you can right-click the Node (who's CSS classes change) in the HTML tab, and \"Break on Attribute Change\"In Chrome (version 35):for css issues, i find web developer plugin invaluable:http://chrispederick.com/work/web-developer/load it, then you have 2 possible tools at your disposal.the latter would also return all classes applied to the element.of course it has other great uses such as, superb debugging of forms, including of editing of hidden fields and cookies (which can be used for penetration testing)You can also inspect that element, then on the style the tab there should be a little drop down arrow. It will have something like \"Show User Agent\", \"Expand Shorthand Properties\", then there should be 2 more under that (I'm guessing that you are inspecting something that has a hover state) :active and :hover select the :hover and you should be golden.I had the same problem and found that whilst I couldn't inspect hover objects in Firefox with Firebug, Safari's Web Inspector would freeze the current state and allow inspection.  To activate Safari's web inspector just enter the following line into the terminal and restart Safari:Activate the hover element in the browser, then right click and select 'Inspect Element'. The page will freeze in it's current state allowing you to inspect the fleeting objects to your heart's content. There is no perfect solution (mouseover/hover-simulation effect) in firebug.However, there are a couple ways to edit your hover state in firebug:I often make some alternate CSS or Javascript to \"freeze\" my hovered event; tweak it to perfection with Firebug and put my hover back in place.Yes, you can right-click \"Inspect element\" when triggering the hover state. This worked for me in Firebug and WebKit.I know this post is a bit old, but for those who find this on Google, I created a cross browser tool that allows you to visualize your HTML / CSS layout just by moving the mouse.  You can easily view elements in their hover state.HTML Box Visualizer - GitHubIn newer Firefox versions (at least v57 and above), the inspector's UI is slightly different than when the other answers were posted.

Because css on its own will not be enough to produce the effect you need.You can play with the left and top css attributes to show the error message on top, left, right or bottom of the element.\nFor example to show the error on the top:And so on. You can refer to jQuery documentation about css for more options.Here is the css I used. The result looks exactly like the one you want. With as little CSS as possible:And here is the background image you need:\n(source: scriptiny.com)  If you want the error message to be displayed after a group of options or fields. Then group all those elements inside one container a 'div' or a 'fieldset'. Add a special class to all of them 'group' for example. And add the following to the begining of the errorPlacement function:If you only want to handle specific cases you can use attr instead:That should be enough for the error message to be displayed next to the parent element.You may need to change the width of the parent element to be less than 100%.I've tried your code and it is working perfectly fine for me. Here is a preview:\nI just made a very small adjustment to the message padding to make it fit in the line:You can change those numbers to increase/decrease the padding on top/bottom or left/right. You can also add a height and width to the error message. If you are still having issues, try to replace the span with a div And then give the container a width (this is very important)About the blank page. As I said I tried your code and it is working for me. It might be something else in your code that is causing the issue.I use jQuery BeautyTips to achieve the little bubble effect you are talking about. I don't use the Validation plugin so I can't really help much there, but it is very easy to style and show the BeautyTips. You should look into it. It's not as simple as just CSS rules, I'm afraid, as you need to use the canvas element and include an extra javascript file for IE to play nice with it.A few things:First, I don't think you really need a validation error for a radio fieldset because you could just have one of the fields checked by default. Most people would rather correct something then provide something. For instance:is more likely to be changed to the right answer as the person DOESN'T want it to go to the default. If they see it blank, they are more likely to think \"none of your business\" and skip it.Second, I was able to get the effect I think you are wanting without any positioning properties. You just add padding-right to the form (or the div of the form, whatever) to provide enough room for your error and make sure your error will fit in that area. Then, you have a pre-set up css class called \"error\" and you set it as having a negative margin-top roughly the height of your input field and a margin-left about the distance from the left to where your padding-right should start. I tried this out, it's not great, but it works with three properties and requires no floats or absolutes:Unfortunately I can't comment with my newbie reputation, but I have a solution for the issue of the screen going blank, or at least this is what worked for me. Instead of setting the wrapper class inside of the errorPlacement function, set it immediately when you're setting the wrapper type. });I'm assuming doing it this way allows the validator to know which div elements to remove, instead of all of them. Worked for me but I'm not entirely sure why, so if someone could elaborate that might help others out a ton.That answer really helped me, in my case i had to filter some elements out and have special aligment on their error div,Add following css to your .validate method to change the css or functionality        If you could provide some reason as to why you need to replace the label with a div, that would certainly help...Also, could you paste a sample that'd be helpful ( http://dpaste.com/ or http://pastebin.com/)"},

Hope it helps!I like ThomasA's answer, but wanted a more realistic context with the wave being used to separate two divs. So I created a more complete demo where the separator SVG gets positioned perfectly between the two divs.Now I thought it would be cool to take it further. What if we could do this all in CSS without the need for the inline SVG? The point being to avoid extra markup. Here's how I did it:Two simple <div>:Demo Wavy divider (with CSS pseudo-elements to avoid extra markup)It was a bit trickier to position than with an inline SVG but works just as well. (Could use CSS custom properties or pre-processor variables to keep the height and padding easy to read.)To edit the colors, you need to edit the URL-encoded SVG itself.Pay attention (like in the first demo) to a change in the viewBox to get rid of unwanted spaces in the SVG. (Another option would be to draw a different SVG.)Another thing to pay attention to here is the background-size set to 100% 100% to get it to stretch in both directions.Recently an awesome tool called Get Waves was introduced where you can simply from UI create your own waves and then export this to SVG format. This is as simple as going to the https://getwaves.io/ website and enjoying it!Here's another way to do it :)  The concept is to create a clip-path polygon with the wave as one side.  This approach is fairly flexible.  You can change the position (left, right, top or bottom) in which the wave appears, change the wave function to any function(t) which maps to [0,1]).  The polygon can also be used for shape-outside, which lets text flow around the wave when in 'left' or 'right' orientation.At the end, an example you can uncomment which demonstrates animating the wave."},

Add an option like so: The correct way:According to Mozilla Dev Network, placeholder is not a valid attribute on a <select> input.Instead, add an option with an empty value and the selected attribute, as shown below. The empty value attribute is mandatory to prevent the default behaviour which is to use the contents of the <option> as the <option>'s value.In modern browsers, adding the required attribute to the <select> element will not allow the user to submit the form which the element is part of if the selected option has an empty value.If you want to style the default option inside the list (which appears when clicking the element), there's a limited number of CSS properties that are well-supported. color and background-color are the 2 safest bets, other CSS properties are likely to be ignored.In my option the best way (in HTML5) to mark the default option is using the custom data-* attributes.1 Here's how to style the default option to be greyed out:However, this will only style the item inside the drop-down list, not the value displayed on the input. If you want to style that with CSS, target your <select> element directly. In that case, you can only change the style of the currently selected element at any time.2If you wanted to make it slightly harder for the user to select the default item, you could set the display: none; CSS rule on the <option>, but remember that this will not prevent users from selecting it (using e.g. arrow keys/typing), this just makes it harder for them to do so.1 This answer previously advised the use of a default attribute which is non-standard and has no meaning on its own.\n2 It's technically possible to style the select itself based on the selected value using JavaScript, but that's outside the scope of this question.

Thus, you need to restrict the height indirectly using inner markup, normally a div element (<td><div>content</div></td>), and set height and overflow properties on the the div element (without setting display: table-cell on it, of course, as that would make its height obey CSS 2.1 table cell rules).I don't think that the accepted answer actually fully solves the problem. You wanted to have a vertical-align: middle on the table-cells content. But when you add a div inside the table-cell and give it a height the content of that inner DIV will be at the top. \nCheck this jsfiddle. The overflow:hidden; works fine, but if you shorten the content so that it's only one line, this line won't be centered verticallyThe solution is not to add a DIV inside the table-cell but rather outside. Here's the Code:You can do either of the following:good luck!Try something like this:-In css you can't set table-cells max height, and if you white-space nowrap then you can't break it with max width, so the solution is javascript working in all browsers.So, this can work for you.For Limiting max-height of all cells or rows in table with Javascript:This script is good for horizontal overflow tables.This script increase the table width 300px each time, maximum 4000px until rows shrinks to max-height(160px) ,  and you can also edit numbers as your need.Source: HTML Table Solution Max Height Limit For Rows Or Cells By Increasing Table Width, JavascriptUse the style below:With the HTML being:if you are using display:table-cell, max-height will not work for div of this style.\nso the solution which worked for me is to set the max height of inner div TryMight this fit your needs?This is what you want:"},
{"title": "CSS keyframe animation CPU usage is high, should it be this way?", "author": "Ilya Tsuryev", "date": "2012-11-01 12:08:32Z", "question": "I use following keyframe animation on several elements:On my computer I am getting around 40% CPU usage both in Chrome and Firefox. \nIs it the current state of animations (nice but not usable for now) or am I missing some magic property?You can check the following sample with the same animation:\nhttp://jsfiddle.net/Nrp6Q/", "url": "[CSS keyframe animation CPU usage is high, should it be this way?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/13176746/css-keyframe-animation-cpu-usage-is-high-should-it-be-this-way)", "vote": 69, "content": "I use following keyframe animation on several elements:On my computer I am getting around 40% CPU usage both in Chrome and Firefox. \nIs it the current state of animations (nice but not usable for now) or am I missing some magic property?You can check the following sample with the same animation:\nhttp://jsfiddle.net/Nrp6Q/Yes, this is normal because you have several infinite-loop animations on the page. The CPU is therefore continually doing work while these elements are rendered. There is a \"magic\" property that will significantly cut-down the CPU usage and that is:This will composite the elements into their own layers (by tricking the browser into thinking it will be doing 3D transforms) and the browser should, in most cases, take advantage of GPU acceleration, lessening the burden on the CPU. For me this cut it down by about 20% (almost half).To read more about this technique take a look at: http://ariya.blogspot.com/2011/07/fluid-animation-with-accelerated.htmlAdditionally, the more keyframes you have in the animation, the more taxing it will be as well. Just try the animation with the middle keyframe cut out and you will see another substantial (~10-12%) drop in CPU usage.Lastly, not all properties are equal -- box-shadow is much harder for the browser to animate smoothly than, say, background-color. Leaving all of the keyframes intact but dropping the box-shadow property, using the translateZ(0) trick had my CPU usage hovered at only 10-11%.As much as it pains me to say this, for infinite-loop animations an animated .gif is going to perform much, much better than CSS3 in the current state of browser animation, especially if you plan for many of them to remain rendered on the page for some time.Update 2017:For those still finding their way to this question and answer, translate3d(0, 0, 0) provides the same benefit as translateZ(0), you're just also setting translateX() and translateY() at the same time. Please ignore the comment by @Farside as he uses translate3d(X, Y, Z) in his demo but does not compare it to translate(X, Y), which would show that using this technique still makes a significant difference.According to this question, some people have found better performance across all browsers, especially Chrome, with transform: rotateZ(360deg).One of the possible ways to reduce the load on CPU, is to use a so called null transform hack, which is often hailed as something of a silver bullet. In many cases it will drastically improve rendering performance in WebKit and Blink browsers like Chrome, Opera and Safari.The null transform hack basically does two things:To \"force\" a browser, simply add one of these CSS properties to the element:When working with 3D transforms, it's good to have these properties as well to improve the performance:Enabling a hardware acceleration in CSS3 for a lot of objects may slow down performance!\nApparently, each null 3D transform creates a new layer. However, force-hacking layer creation may not always be the solution to certain performance bottlenecks on a page. Layer creation techniques can boost page speed, but they come with a cost: they take up memory in system RAM and on the GPU. So even if the GPU does a good job, the transfer of many objects might be a problem so that using GPU acceleration might not be worth it. The cite from W3C:Moving a few big objects has a higher performance, than moving lots of small items when using 3D-acceleration. So they must be used wisely and you need to make sure that hardware-accelerating your operation will really help the performance of your page, and that a performance bottleneck is not being caused by another operation on your page.Moreover, a GPU is designed specifically for performing the complex mathematical/geometric calculations, and offloading operations onto the GPU can yield massive power consumption. Obviously, when hardware kicks in, so does the battery of the target device. The progress is not standing on the one place... W3C introduced the will-change CSS property. To cut the long story short, the will-change property allows you to inform the browser ahead of time of what kinds of changes you are likely to make to an element, so that it can set up the appropriate optimizations before they're needed.Here's what they say in the the draft:Using will-change, hinting to the browser about an upcoming transformation can be as simple as adding this rule to the element that you’re expecting to be transformed:When developing for mobile, developers are forced to take the wide array of device constraints into consideration while writing mobile web apps. Browsers are becoming smarter, and sometimes, it's better to leave the decision to the platform itself, instead of overlapping acceleration and forcing the behavior in a hacky-way.I had a similar case of high CPU usage when animating some elements with CSS3. I was animating the \"left\"-property of ~7 elements, with some opacity- and shadow-properties used in my whole page. I decided to switch to jQuery.animate, which sadly didn't improve the performance at all. My CPU (i7) was still at ~9-15% while displaying the page, several tricks (translateZ, etc) didn't really improve the performance either - while having my layout messed up (some absolute-positioned elements were involved, ouch!).Then I stumbled upon this wonderful extension: http://playground.benbarnett.net/jquery-animate-enhanced/I simply referenced the .js-file, didn't make a single change at the jQuery transitions, and my CPU usage is now 1-2% on the very same page.My recommendation: when facing CPU issues using CSS3 transitions, switch to jQuery + the animate-enhanced-plugin.You can also use this on any of the following class elements where you want to use GPU instead of CPUTo a particular case of 'pulsing' background animation, reported here, I've come up with a css+js solution.In my case the background animation was on background-position property rather than on the background-color, but the principle is the same.Ok, let's say you have a block with a particular background:Let's style it: (scss)Now it's time to make the effect happen by adding a class 'animated' to the block with some JavaScript:This improved performace in my case by ~15 times.(i) Note to calculate seconds for transition and timeouts correctly both in css and js if you want values different from 5 seconds."},

Since this rule appears later in the source order, it overrides any previous or external declarations.I'd argue this isn't exactly the most robust or elegant approach, but it illustrates the most basic example.Another solution I ran across tonight, which worked for my needs, was to add box-sizing attributes:These attributes force the border to be part of the box model's width and height and correct the issue as well.According to caniuse.com » box-sizing, box-sizing is supported in IE8+.If you're using LESS or Sass there is a Bootstrap mixin for this.LESS:Sass:"},

It's a great little API and has great support for Bootstrap.I tend to use the template filters for quickly porting old code and quick forms, and the template tags when I need more control over the rendering.This is what I came up with:When django-crispy-forms cannot be used (e.g. when the template treats individually each field of the form), jcmrgo's answer is the only way to go. Based on his answer, here is a solution for Bootstrap 3 (leaving his version for Boostrap 2), and with adjustment of field classes inside the template. While field classes are not reachable from within the template with Django's standard library (which leads to that extra forms or template tags in other solutions), here is a solution that sets the right classes to field tags without having to code outside the template:This needs django-widget-tweaks installed and widget_tweaks added to INSTALLED_APPS.You could do something like this:In order to add CSS attributes to Django generated forms it's enough to use the following code in your forms.py:It will produce the following HTML code:I definitely recommend https://github.com/dyve/django-bootstrap-toolkitFor Example, you could created a class which defines the attributes the way you want and just call it accordingly.Bootstrap styles forms with <div>s rather than <p>s. So, if you want it to look nice, you need to go bootstrap way 100% IMHO. And here is my preferred way of doing it:Use django-bootstrap3 app. Example:Notice the horizontal in 1) form class attribute 2) bootstrap_form layout and 3) buttons layout.Here is my version using django_tweaks with a better looking result. I find render_field lighter to use than adding filters. I have also added bootstrap formatted alert messages and turned off navigator validation (with novalidate). I am relatively new to Django so don't hesitate to comment if you find any non-senseThe fastest and easiest way would be to define your own base class that extends the Django Form class, and redefine its as_p method to output in the format Bootstrap requires. Then change your forms to inherit from your new Form class instead of Django's.besides what other friends said, I would recommend using 'django-widget-tweaks'.the answer would be sth like this:"},

This will keep the structure the way you want it to look and provide the viewer with the ability to scroll over to see more.Edit: the nice thing about overflow: auto compared to overflow: scroll is that with auto, the scrollbars will only appear when overflowing content exists.  With scroll, the scrollbars are always visible.I'm surprised that nobody has mentioned one of my favorite solutions to this problem, the <wbr> (optional line-break) tag. It's fairly well-supported in browsers and essentially tells the browser that it can insert a line-break if it's necessary. There's also the related zero-width space character, &#8203; with the same meaning.For the use case mentioned, displaying user comments on a web page, I would assume that there is already some output formatting to prevent injection attacks, etc. So it's simple to add these <wbr> tags every N characters in words that are too long, or in links.This is especially useful when you need control over the format of the output, which CSS doesn't always let you do.I would put the post in a div that would have a fixed width setting overflow to scroll (or to hide completely depending on the content).so like:But that's just me.EDIT: As cLFlaVA points out... it is better to use auto then scroll.

Replace the \"Dropdown.prototype.toggle\" function in your bootstrap.js (or dropdown.js) with the following:On the second click (ie: if the menu item has the class \"open\") it will first check if the href is undefined or set to \"javascript:;\" before sending you along your merry way.Enjoy!This enables the link in the top-level menu of the dropdown when it's opened and disables it when closed, with the only drawback of apparently having to \"tap\" twice outside of the dropdown to close it in mobile devices.Note this assumes the \"standard\" markup and Turbolinks (Rails). You can try with $(document).ready(...)Alternatively here's a simple jQuery solution:i know  its too  late but anyone who came here for help now you can see this  post .There are two options either use css/ JavaScript and if you use css it will be applicable to devices greater that  769px width for clickable top menu, that will be work perfectly fSee here  for article Most of the above solutions are not mobile friendly.The solution I am proposing detects if its not touch device and that the navbar-toggle (hamburger menu) is not visible and makes the parent menu item revealing submenu on hover and and follow its link on clickAlso makes tne margin-top 0 because the gap between the navbar and the menu in some browser will not let you hover to the subitemsThis worked in my case:This 100% works:HTML:CSS:EXAMPLE in CODEPEN"},

So you can try using some kind of transparent linear gradient layer placed on top of the text area, we can achieve this in a neat way using the pseudo-element :before like this:FiddleI’d suggest something like this:Apply the gradient to an absolutely positioned pseudo-element (:after), that get’s positioned at say 160px from top with 40px height – that way, it’ll not be shown at all in shorter boxes (because of their max-height in combination with overflow:hidden). And the gradient itself is from totally transparent (rgba(0,0,0,0)) to solid black.http://jsfiddle.net/b9vtW/2/I think your are looking for something like this, right?http://jsfiddle.net/QPFkH/If you don't need to rely on percentage values, use box-shadow instead of background-image. It makes it possible to let the user interact with the elements behind your fading-thingy, without the need of pointer-events: none (http://caniuse.com/#feat=pointer-events):But be warned, box-shadow can slow down scrolling:I recomend you to use http://www.colorzilla.com/gradient-editor/.What you are looking for may be:and if not workign as you wish, copy and paste those css in the url (css window) and modifie it at will.Your code is correct just the liner gradient percent must be setTry the fiddle linkhttp://jsfiddle.net/ShinyMetilda/kb4fL/1/You could alse specfiy it in pixel like thisBoth works the sameI had a similar problem with a bootstrap button which has a vertical gradient and also change of gradient on hover.

First way:Second way:If you control the css changes, the second option is a lot more elegant and efficient way of doing it.Documentations:Please don't use techniques described in other answers here. They are either not working with css3 animations size changes, floating layout changes or changes that don't come from jQuery land. You can use a resize-detector, a event-based approach, that doesn't waste your CPU time.https://github.com/marcj/css-element-queriesIt contains a ResizeSensor class you can use for that purpose.Disclaimer: I wrote this libraryFor future sake I'll post this.

If you view the code that is used for the demo website and basically copy/paste, you'll be fine.To get an inline Fancybox working, you will need to have this code present in your index.html file:Remember to be precise about what folders your script files are placed in and where you are pointing to in the Head tag; they must correspond.Just something I found for Wordpress users,As obvious as it sounds, If your div is returning some AJAX content based on say a header that would commonly link out to a new post page, some tutorials will say to return false since you're returning the post data on the same page and the return would prevent the page from moving. However if you return false, you also prevent Fancybox2 from doing it's thing as well. I spent hours trying to figure that stupid simple thing out. So for these kind of links, just make sure that the href property is the hashed (#) div you wish to select, and in your javascript, make sure that you do not return false since you no longer will need to.Simple I know ^_^ "},

The pro,benefit for this solution is you keep font size scaling without having super mini letters and you can keep it js free.Looks like I'm a bit late but for others with this issue try this codeuse whatever tag you prefer and size you prefer (replace the 3)is used for a max size.CSS Solution:Just in case if some need scss mixin:AFAIK it's not possible with plain CSS,\nbut you can do a pretty expensive jQuery operation like:jsBin demoInstead of using the Global Selector * I'd suggest you (if possible) to be more specific with your selectors.Judging by your above comment, you're OK doing this with jQuery — here goes:A cleaner way to do this might be to have a \"min-font\" class in your CSS that sets font-size: 12px, and just add the class instead:The font-min-size and font-max-size CSS properties were removed from the CSS Fonts Module Level 4 specification (and never implemented in browsers AFAIK). And the CSS Working Group replaced the CSS examples with font-size: clamp(...) which doesn't have the greatest browser support yet so we'll have to wait for browsers to support it.

Why can't the css just reference the body tag?The container div, and sometimes content div, are almost always used to allow for more sophisticated CSS styling.  The body tag is special in some ways.  Browsers don't treat it like a normal div; its position and dimensions are tied to the browser window.But a container div is just a div and you can style it with margins and borders.  You can give it a fixed width, and you can center it with margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto.Plus, content, like a copyright notice for example, can go on the outside of the container div, but it can't go on the outside of the body, allowing for content on the outside of a border.THis method allows you to have more flexibility of styling your entire content.  Effectivly creating two containers that you can style.  THe HTML Body tag which serves as your background, and the div with an id of container which contains your content.This then allows you to position your content within the page, while styling a background or other effects without issue.  THink of it as a \"Frame\" for the content.The most common reasons for me are so that:Certain browsers (<cough> Internet Explorer) don't support certain properties on the body, notably width and max-width.I know this is an old question, but i faced this issue myself redesigning a website.\nTroy Dalmasso got me thinking. He makes a good point. So, i started to see if i could get it working without a container div.I could when i set the width of the body. In my case to 960px.This is the css i use:This nicely centers the inline-blocks which also have a fixed width.Hope this is of use to anyone.This is one of the biggest bad habits perpetrated by front end coders.All the answers above me are wrong. The body does take a width, margins, borders, etc and should act as your initial container. The html element should act as your background \"canvas\" as it was intended. In dozens of sites I've done I've only had to use a container div once.I'd be willing to be that these same coders using container divs are also littering their markup with divs inside of divs--everywhere else.Dont' do it. Use divs sparingly and aim for lean markup.-=-=-\nUPDATE - Not sure what's wrong with SO because I can edit this answer from 5 years ago but I can't reply to the comments as it says I need 50 Rep before I can do so. Accordingly, I'll add my answer to the replies it received here.\n-=-=-I just found this, years after my answer, and see that there are some follow up replies. And, surely you jest?The installed placeholder site you found for my domain, which I never claimed was my markup or styling, or even mentioned in my post, was very clearly a basic CMS install with not one word of content (it said as much on the homepage). That was not my markup and styling. That was the Silverstripe default template. And I take no credit for it. It is, though, perhaps one of only two examples I can think of that would necessitate a container div.Example 1: A generic template designed to accommodate unknowns. In this case you were seeing a default CMS template that had divs inside of divs inside of divs.The horror.Example 2: A three column layout to get the footer to clear properly (I think this was probably the scenario I had that needed a container div, hard to remember because that was years ago.)I did just build (not even finished yet) a theme for my domain and started loading content. For this easily achieved example of semantic markup, click the link.http://www.bitbeyond.comFrankly, I'm baffled that people think you actually need a container div and start with one before ever even trying just a body. The body, as I heard it explained once by one of the original authors of the CSS spec, was intended as the \"initial container\".Markup should be added as needed, not because thats just the way you've seen it done.div tags are used to style the webpage so that it look visually appealing for the users or audience of the website. using container-div in html will make the website look more professional and attractive and therefore more people will want to explore your page.Well,The container div is very good to have, because if You want the site centered, You just can't do it just with body or html... But You can, with divs. Why container? Its usually used, just because the code itselve has to be clean and readable. So that is container... It contains all website, in case You want to mess with it around :)Good luckMost of the browser are taking web page size by default. So, sometime page will not display same in different browser. So, by using  user can change for specific HTML element. For example, user can add margin, size, width, height etc of specific HTML tag. "},

To be on the safe side I would recommend a class, you never know when changing all elements of a certain type will come back to bite you. Or, you could always make up your own tag and assign display:inline-block; to it. This way you aren't changing the default functionality of standard elements...EDITIt also appears that button, textarea, input, and select elements are also inline-blockSources:According to this img is inline-block http://dev.w3.org/html5/markup/img.html#img-displayAnd here claims that button, textarea, etc. are as well: http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/sample.htmlEDIT #2While the source above claims that img tags are inline-block it seems (thanks to Alohci) that they are just inline http://jsfiddle.net/AQ2yp/The following were tested in Firefox:button is inline-block: http://jsfiddle.net/GLS4P/textarea is inline: http://jsfiddle.net/235vc/input is inline: http://jsfiddle.net/RFKe8/select is inline-block: http://jsfiddle.net/5B4Gs/Strictly speaking, no there isn't. The W3 HTML specifications do not ever specify default CSS property values for any elements. They do provide a \"default style sheet\" for HTML 4, but developers are only encouraged to use it - it is not a requirement or any sort of mandate. The HTML 5 specifications indicate \"typical default display properties\" but, again, those are not required (also keep in mind that HTML 5 is still a working draft anyways).So that leaves all default values up to the browser and how the developers actually feel elements should be displayed to a user. No one can guarantee that a specific element will display as inline-block or any other way in someone's browser. You should always explicitly set that if you want it to happen. Don't rely on \"defaults.\"This is up to you and how you are designing your pages. You should always use elements that are semantically appropriate to the content contained within them. If the element will always be used in a context which will require inline-block display, by all means set it to that in your style sheet. Otherwise, you will have to resort to classes or more specific selectors in order to make your elements display properly.Here is a Fiddle that gets the default display value for a majority of HTML tags.FiddleIn chrome, the default inline-block elements are: \"INPUT\", \"BUTTON\", \"TEXTAREA\", \"SELECT\"In principle, it depends on the browser what the default value for the display property is for each element. Even HTML5 drafts do not prescribe what values must be used, though it presents “expected rendering” of elements in terms of CSS.According the default style sheet for HTML in the CSS 2.1 specification, the elements that have display: inline-block by default are button, input, select, and textarea. Browsers use such settings, except that in Firefox, this only applies to button and select.In the Rendering section of HTML5 CR, the meter and progress elements are additionally describes as having inline block as “expected rendering”, and browsers that have implemented these elements appear to behave that way. The keygen element is also described as being an inline block, but Firefox does not do that (it implemented keygen internally as select in the DOM); IE does not support keygen at all; Chrome implements it as suggested.Since all of these elements have rather specialized meanings, functionality, and rendering idiosyncracies, none of them is adequate for general use as an element that is an inline block by default and may have various meanings. What you can use for such an element is normally span or div, depending on whether you prefer inline or block as the default rendering.You can check my codepen with all HTML elements and their display property by default. Some tags are syntax-broken, but it does not matter for our purpose.Currently, there are 5 elements with display: inline-block in FF :And additional 2 (including 5 above) in Chrome:button, textarea, input, and select default to inline-block.In the event you would want to inline-block a div you'd give it a class name.Then...CORRECTIONI was mistaken about img. It seems it defaults to inline and not inline-blockNow you can create a Custom Element (for example: <inline-block> or whatever) that will have its CSS property display set to inline-block by default.My solution to this is declaring what I call a slice.CSSUsageThis isn't really a true answer to the question right now, but with enough support, it may someday be.<seg> short for \"segment\".  As in, segments of a line.with the polyfill:It really would be nice if there was an official one, but there is not, so here is the best (IMO) suggested name for such an element that I know of.YES there is an element that defaults to inline.The answer is the span element.

There is a difference though. When using a calc() rule the value of the width of the content div will actually be 100% - width of fixed div, however with the above technique, the actual width of the content div is the full 100% width, yet it has the appearance of 'filling up' the remaining width. (which is probably good enough for want most people need here)That said, if it is important that the content div's width is actually 100% - fixed div width  then a different technique - which makes use of block formatting contexts - may be used (see here and here for the gory details):1) float the fixed width div2) set overflow:hidden or overflow:auto on the content divJust have a fallback before the calc will do the trick.

Naturally, the problem is the response div, as its height varies depending on the amount of data currently being displayed within it.How might I ensure that the height of the two columns are always equal?Wrap them in a containing div with the background color applied to it, and have a clearing div after the 'columns'.Updated to address some comments and my own thoughts:This method works because its essentially a simplification of your problem, in this somewhat 'oldskool' method I put two columns in followed by an empty clearing element, the job of the clearing element is to tell the parent (with the background) this is where floating behaviour ends, this allows the parent to essentially render 0 pixels of height at the position of the clear, which will be whatever the highest priorly floating element is.The reason for this is to ensure the parent element is as tall as the tallest column, the background is then set on the parent to give the appearance that both columns have the same height.It should be noted that this technique is 'oldskool' because the better choice is to trigger this height calculation behaviour with something like clearfix or by simply having overflow: hidden on the parent element.Whilst this works in this limited scenario, if you wish for each column to look visually different, or have a gap between them, then setting a background on the parent element won't work, there is however a trick to get this effect.The trick is to add bottom padding to all columns, to the max amount of size you expect that could be the difference between the shortest and tallest column, if you can't work this out then pick a large figure, you then need to add a negative bottom margin of the same number.You'll need overflow hidden on the parent object, but the result will be that each column will request to render this additional height suggested by the margin, but not actually request layout of that size (because the negative margin counters the calculation). This will render the parent at the size of the tallest column, whilst allowing all the columns to render at their height + the size of bottom padding used, if this height is larger than the parent then the rest will simply clip off.You can see an example of this technique on the bowers and wilkins website (see the four horizontal spotlight images the bottom of the page).If you are trying to force a floating div to match another to create a column effect, this is what I do. I like it because it's simple and clean.I think this makes sense. It seems to work well even with dynamic content.Here is a jQuery plugin to set the heights of multiple divs to be the same. And below is the actual code of the plugin.The correct solution for this problem is to use display: table-cellImportant: This solution doesn't need float since table-cell already turns the div into an element that lines up with the others in the same container. That also means you don't have to worry about clearing floats, overflow, background shining through and all the other nasty surprises that the float hack brings along to the party.CSS:HTML:Related:You should wrap them in a div with no float.I also use the clearfix patch on here http://www.webtoolkit.info/css-clearfix.htmlI can't understand why this issue gets pounded into the ground when in 30 seconds you can code a two-column table and solve the problem.This div column height problem comes up all over a typical layout. Why resort to scripting when a plain old basic HTML tag will do it? Unless there are huge and numerous tables on a layout, I don't buy the argument that tables are significantly slower.Flex does this by default.CSS: https://jsfiddle.net/784pnojq/1/BONUS: multiple rowshttps://jsfiddle.net/784pnojq/2/I recommend you wrap them both in an outer div with the desired background color.You can always use a background image to do it too. I tend to vote for this option 100% of the time as the only other perfect solution is the Jquery option.As with using the outer div with a background color you'll end up having to have the content in both divs reaching the same height.This code will let you have a variable number of rows (with a variable number of DIVs on each row) and it will make all of the DIVs on each row match the height of its tallest neighbour:If we assumed all the DIVs, that are floating, are inside a container with the id \"divContainer\", then you could use the following:Having had the same sort of problem as well, requiring three divs next to each other with different content, with right-borders to 'seperate' them, the only solution that worked was a slightly modified version of the jQuery option in another answer. Remember you also need the script found here.Below is my slightly modified version of the script, which just allows for a true min-height setting (as I needed my boxes to be at least a certain height).It works like a charm and doesn't slow anything down :)"},

Use https version of URL.See similar problem in question Strange Issue while Google Font Rendering.Solution is in loading the desired font (I my case 'Fira Sans') from the Mozilla CDN instead of Google CDN.It is not a actual solution but it works better for me than everything else in this thread. I changed the font.

This causes the generator to not include the local('sans-serif') source.Hope it helps someone.I'm just sharing what worked for me. Your results may vary.I had main.css with an @import of multiple fonts, separated by a | (pipe) character. This had been working up until today. I kept all of my Google Font imports in the main CSS file because I didn't have that many. Today I added one that simply wouldn't render, either in Chrome or Firefox. I tried a different font - same problem.Finally, I made a separate @import in another CSS file that gets loaded for several pages on the site (let's call it navbar_pages.css, for example) - this CSS gets included in the relevant pages via <link rel=\"stylesheet\" type=\"text/css\" href=\"/css/navbar_pages.css\">, just like main.css does.For some reason, having the @import in a separate CSS file solved the problem.I suspect it is due to a limit on the number of fonts that can be called in a single @import call. More testing should be done to pin down the cause, but for now there is my workaround. If anyone has insights, please chime in with a comment.It may not be a silver bullet, but fixe the issue on our site by moving the fontawesome css link to the bottom of our pages as well as weblike fix listed above.If people are still having this problem before you try all the great solutions on here try using an !important tag in your css to see if that will fix it, as it did for me and I am not sure if the bug is the same as the old Chrome bug.Checkout plugin I made: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/fontfix/ekgfbmjaehhpbakdbpfmlepngjkaalokIt does the web realign with pure javascript, which force browser to redraw whole page."},

(For example, table always has a border attribute, with 0 for a default.)By CSS specifications, browsers may or may not use information about default attributes; mostly the don’t. The relevant clause in the CSS 2.1 spec is 5.8.2 Default attribute values in DTDs. In CSS 3 Selectors, it’s clause 6.3.4, with the same name. It recommends: “Selectors should be designed so that they work whether or not the default values are included in the document tree.”It is generally best to explicitly specify essential attributes such as type=text instead of defaulting them. The reason is that there is no simple reliable way to refer to the input elements with defaulted type attribute.Because, it is not supposed to do that.input[type=text] { } is an attribute selector, and will only select those element, with the matching attribute.To be compliant with all browsers you should always declare the input type. Some browsers will assume default type as 'text', but this isn't a good practice.try this"},

The main reason I asked, was to make sure it's not possible today, before I contact the css3 working group. So please don't answer if you can't follow the requirements in the question ;)It sounds to me like you want to have a touch-screen-friendly option, to cover the following scenarios:For case 1 and 2 you will probably need a separate site or a CSS file that eliminates lots of unnecessary content and makes things larger and easier to read/navigate.  If you care about case #2 then as long as the links/buttons on the page are keyboard-navigable then case 1 and 2 are equivalent.For case 3 you have your normal website.  For case 4 it sounds like you want clickable things to be bigger or easier to touch.  If it's not possible to simply make everything bigger for all users, an alternate style-sheet can provide you with the touch-friendly layout changes.The easiest thing to do is provide a link to the touch-screen-version of the site somewhere on the page.  For well-known touch devices such as iPad you can sniff the user agent and set the touch stylesheet as the default.  However I'd consider making this the default for everyone; if your design looks good on the iPad it should look acceptably good on any notebook.  Your mouse users with less-than-stellar clicking skills will be pleased to find bigger click targets, especially if you add appropriate :hover or mouseover effects to let users know that things are clickable.I know you said you don't want to sniff user-agents.  But I'd contend that at this time the state of browser support for this is in too much flux to worry about the \"Correct\" way to do it.  Browsers will eventually provide the information that you need, but you will probably find that it will be years before this information is ubiquitous.Good news! The editor draft of CSS4 Media Queries have included a new media feature 'pointer'.It's also possible to test the media query from JavaScript:Updated Feb. 11th. 2013 On Windows 8 recent versions of Chrome (version 24+) detect touch-hardware when launching the application and expose touch events. Unfortunately if \"pointer:coarse\" returns false, there is no way to know if it's because pointer media queries are not implemented or because there is a fine pointer. WebKit haven't implemented \"pointer:fine\" yet, so we can't check that either.Update Sept. 26th. 2012\nTested in Safari on iOS6 and Chrome on Android 4.1.1 and it's not there yet. 'pointer' and 'hover' media-queries landed in WebKit May 30th. According to the User-Agent, Safari uses WebKit branch 536.26 from April 25th, and Chrome on Android uses and even older one (535.19). Not sure WebKit branches from User-Agent strings are to be trusted, but my test page is not able to detect pointer media queries either.\nThe implementation from May only implements the pointer media query for touch devices, so pointer: fine won't work for devices with a mouse.I don't know if a standardized media query like Mozilla's will solve the problem by itself.  Like one of the Chromium developers said in that discussion you linked, the presence of touch event support in the browser doesn't mean touch events can or will fire, or even if they do, that the user will only want to interact via touch input.  Likewise, the presence of touch input support in the device doesn't mean the user will use that method of input - perhaps the device supports mouse, keyboard, and touch input and the user prefers the mouse or some combination of the three input types.  I agree with the Chromium developer that supporting touch events was not a bug in the browser.  A good browser should support touch events because it might be installed on a device that supports touch input.  It's the website developer's fault that he took the event support to mean the user would be interacting via touch.It seems we need to know two things:\n(1) What are all the supported input types on the device\n(2) What are all the supported event types in the browserSince we don't know #1 right now, there is one approach proposed by PPK of quirksmode that I like.  He talks about it here: http://www.quirksmode.org/blog/archives/2010/02/do_we_need_touc.html#link4Basically, listen for touch events and mouse events, and when they happen, set up the UI accordingly.  Obviously that's limiting to the developer.  I don't think it's a valid approach to your problem with link size because you don't want to wait for interaction to alter the UI.  The whole point is to present a different UI (a larger/smaller link) before any interaction occurs.I hope you make your proposal and it gets included in CSS3.  Until then, as much as it pains me to say it, user agent sniffing looks like the best approach.p.s. I hope hope hope someone comes here and proves me wrongGoogle Chrome has a command line switch for enabling touch events. Disabled by default. So until they enable them for everyone again (hopefully they won't), it's possible to detect touch with the help of javascript like I described in the question..Update jun 3 2010: This actually got into the stable version on 25th of May 2010 :( Don't know it it was a mistake or not.Have discussed the issue on the w3c mailing list, but I doubt anything will happen very soon. http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-style/2010May/0411.html\nThey might discuss this during TPAC in November.Update sep 30 2010: Supposedly fixed in Chrome 6. Haven't had time to downgrade to stable yet to verify. Since Chrome upgrade automatically this problem should already be gone :)Read this if you're considering using media queries:\nhttp://www.cloudfour.com/css-media-query-for-mobile-is-fools-gold/\nand http://www.quirksmode.org/blog/archives/2010/09/more_about_medi.htmlUpdate may 16th 2011: W3C is now working on a Touch Events specification, but more or less refused to hide touch events for terminals without touch hardware. So don't expect the touch event detection to work for long.Update june 6th 2012: The W3C CSS4 Media Queries (Editors Draft) spec have something very interesting. See my separate answer about this.No, there is no such thing.\nCSS has the screen size option, which will allow you to optimize layout, but that's all.\nThere is also media=\"handheld\" but that also doesn't apply to your requirements.Feature detection might work using javascript, however, there are issues with different events for different devices.  PPK (the man behind quirksmode.org) is doing a huge amount of work checking what javascript is possible for each mobile/handheld device, and it's proving that nothing seems to be standard with these devices and yet this STILL doesn't apply to your requirement for touch laptop devices.\n(honestly I dont know why you are concerned about a device that isn't even out yet, be pragmatic and worry about it once it's here and you can test it)PPK's work on mobile browser and touch events, will save you hours.  Check it out hereApple has TouchEvents defined only for iPhone OS FWIWNot a complete solution, but you might want to simply outright avoid any small buttons. While small buttons are more of a usability problem on touch devices, they are always hard to use, even with a big screen & mouse.If you just pay attention to using suitably big buttons with enough space between them, everyone will benefit. Plus, it will force you not to clutter your interface with too many small buttons :-).try using tables and make a full cell to be a link...\ni'm working on that in my website...\nit's not working well so far...\nbut you might find a way...\non this way, no need to overload your website with javascript and functionality detection...\nyou can give it a relative size instread of a fixed size...\nand in this way, your website can be viewed in a desktop as is viewed in a iphone...\nthink about this idea...\nany sugestion is apreciated...See http://crbug.com/136119 for support for adding pointer:fine in Chrome.  It is actually possible to detect whether pointer:coarse is supported (to distinguish unset from not supported) - just create the media query yourself and test in javascript whether it parsed properly.Eg., today \"@media (pointer:coarse)\" in Chrome shows up:But unsupported bogus values like \"@media (pointer:other)\" don't:You won't have any control over detecting touches, and even if you did the logic steps to figure out what exactly the user is trying to touch is complex and best handled by the device itself. Your best bet is to create a mobile version of the site or an alternate stylesheet that is loaded when you detect a mobile device with Javascript.If you are using PHP, this is a good solution:http://chrisschuld.com/projects/browser-php-detecting-a-users-browser-from-php/You can detect whether the browser is a phone from the serverside by sniffing the browser request details, and if so, display alternative/extra stylesheets/js/html"},

Should I run separate instances of webpack for these separate modules? Should I even be using webpack for non-JS assets if I'm not going to mix them into my JS?Maybe not. Webpack is definitely js-centric, with the implicit assumption that what you're building is a js application. Its implementation of require() allows you to treat everything as a module (including Sass/LESS partials, JSON, pretty much anything), and automatically does your dependency management for you (everything that you require is bundled, and nothing else).People do this because they're defining a piece of their application (e.g. a React component, a Backbone View) with js. That piece of the application has CSS that goes with it. Depending on some external CSS resource that's built separately and not directly referenced from the js module is fragile, harder to work with, and can lead to styles getting out of date, etc. Webpack encourages you to keep everything modular, so you have a CSS (Sass, whatever) partial that goes with that js component, and the js component require()s it to make the dependency clear (to you and to the build tool, which never builds styles you don't need). I don't know if you could use webpack to bundle CSS on its own (when the CSS files aren't referenced from any js). I'm sure you could wire something up with plugins, etc., but not sure it's possible out of the box. If you do reference the CSS files from your js, you can easily bundle the CSS into a separate file with the Extract Text plugin, as you say. A separate CSS bundle can be generated without using require('main/less) in any of your JS, but as Brendan pointed out in the first part of his answer Webpack isn't designed for a global CSS bundle to go alongside modular JS, however there are a couple of options.The first is to add an extra entry point for main.less, then use the Extract Text plugin to create the CSS bundle:The problem with this method is you also generate an unwanted JS file as well as the bundle, in this example: style.js which is just an empty Webpack module.Another option is to add the main less file to an existing Webpack entry point:This is ideal if you have only 1 entry point, but if you have more, then your Webpack config will look a bit odd as you'll have to arbitrarily choose which entry point to add the main less file to.To further clarify bdmason's former answer - it seems the desirable configuration would be to create a JS and CSS bundle for each page, like so:And then use the [name] switch:Full configuration - with some additions not connected to the question (we're actually using SASS instead of LESS):Yes, this is possible but like others said you will need additional packages to do so (see devDependencies under package.json). here is the sample code that I used to compile my bootstrap SCSS --> CSS and Bootstrap JS --> JS.webpack.config.js:additional postcss.config.js file:package.json:See the tutorial here: https://florianbrinkmann.com/en/4240/sass-webpackthe webpack team recommends using mini-css-extract over the extract text plugin this solution allows you to create a separate chunk containing only your css entries: Here is a more contrived example using mutliple entries from one of my personal projects: I realize this approach is not very modular, but it should give you a foundation to build from and is an excellent strategy for adopting webpack in projects where you do not wish to inter-mix javascript and css. The downside to this approach is that css-loader still generates an additional javascript file (whether you choose to use it or not), this will supposedly be fixed in webpack 5. I don't see anything wrong with this but ultimately it depends on your tolerance for managing multiple build systems. To me this feels like overkill, so my preference is to remain in the webpack ecosystem. For more information on the strategies outlined above, please see https://github.com/webpack-contrib/mini-css-extract-plugin#extracting-css-based-on-entryYou can also put your Less require statements in your entry JS file also:in body.jsThen in webpack"},

I did not test IE6. The outer text-align is needed for IE. Other browsers (and IE9?) will work when you give the DIV margin (left and right) value of auto. Margin \"0 auto\" is a shorthand for margin \"0 auto 0 auto\" (top right bottom left).Note: the text is also centered inside the inner DIV, if you want it to remain on the left side just specify text-align: left; for the inner DIV.Edit: IE 6, 7, 8 and 9 running on the Standards Mode will work with margins set to auto.I think that the the align=\"center\" aligns the content, so if you wanted to use that method, you would need to use it in a 'wraper' div - a div that just wraps the rest.text-align is doing a similar sort of thing. left:50% is ignored unless you set the div's position to be something like relative or absolute.The generally accepted methods is to use the following propertiesthe margins being auto means they grow/shrink to match the browser window (or parent div)UPDATEThanks to Meo for poiting this out, if you wanted to you could save time and use the short hand propery for the margin.this defines the top and bottom as 0 (as it is zero it does not matter about lack of units) and the left and right get defined as 'auto' You can then, if you wan't override say  the top margin as you would with any other CSS rules.it depends if your div is in position: absolute / fixed or relative / staticfor position: absolute & fixedThe trick here is to have a negative margin half the width of the objectfor position: relative & staticfor both techniques it is imperative to set de widthhow about something along these lines"},

Use a wrapping <div> with text-align: center as suggested by others to get them on the same line.I see a few answers here, most of them complicated or with some cons (additional divs, text-align doesn't work because of display: inline-block). I think this is the simplest and problem-free solution:HTML:CSS:Try this :This has 2 examples, you can use the one that fits best in your situation.note that auto is used with single blocks to center them in the parent space by distrubuting the empty space to the left and right.

If I useI only have a new line between the two passage (no break). Why?In HTML, elements containing nothing but normal whitespace characters are considered empty. A paragraph that contains just a normal space character will have zero height. A non-breaking space is a special kind of whitespace character that isn't considered to be insignificant, so it can be used as content for a non-empty paragraph.Even if you consider CSS margins on paragraphs, since an \"empty\" paragraph has zero height, its vertical margins will collapse. This causes it to have no height and no margins, making it appear as if it were never there at all.How about a workaround?\nIn my case I took the value of the textarea in a jQuery variable, and changed all \"<p>&nbsp\" to <p class=\"clear\"> and clear class to have certain height and margin, as the following example:jQuerythe val is then saved to the database with the new val.CSSYou can adjust the height & margin as you wish.\nAnd since 'p' is a display: block element. it should give you the expected output.Hope that helps!If I understand your issue this should work&emsp—the em space; this should be a very wide space, typically as much as four real spaces.\n&ensp—the en space; this should be a somewhat wide space, roughly two regular spaces.\n&thinsp—this will be a narrow space, even more narrow than a regular space.Sources: http://hea-www.harvard.edu/~fine/Tech/html-sentences.html "},

In your case:Just to update on my questionThis is the solution I go with, this is obviously fixed for Bootstrap4, which is flexbox compatible. So this is only for bootstrap3.I know the issue is quite old, but I ran into this issue today, and wasted over 12 hours in fixing it. Though about 10 hours out of that were spent in realizing that safari is failing with 12-column bootstrap grid, and it is no other issue.Fix that I made is rather simple. Here is the version for Visual Composer. Class names may vary for other frameworks.I didn't want to add more classes to fix this kind of bug, \nso alternatively you can fix the .row class itself.Found this issue trying to do a simple grid using Bootstrap for the TwentyThree CMS, and got the same bug in Safari. Anyway, this solved it for me:I was able to fix it by addingObviously this isn't the most elegant solution but it may work for some in the meantime until they fix it.I've spent a few hours on this issue as well. In my case I inserted flexbox in an existing project to make all elements in a row have the same height. All browsers except Safari rendered it correctly, but none of the above answers seemed to fix my problem.Until I discovered that there still was a Bootstrap clearfix hack being used:\n(code is from a laravel project, but generic Bootstrap otherwise)Apparently, other browsers than Safari ignore the .clearfix in some way when flexbox is being used.So, when using flexbox on your columns, there is no need to use Bootstrap's clearfix anymore.Bootstrap 4 have issues with display: block; property when set either from css or from javascript on the .row class. I figured a solution for this\nJust create a class as:And then apply this class when you want to display the row.This seems to be a bug in Safari's rendering causing the columns to overflow (and therefore wrap) the Bootstrap container (some kind of Webkit rounding error maybe?). Since you are using Bootstrap, you should be able to achieve the desired result without using flex:But! Now the problem looking at your example is that you need to keep your product blocks the exact same size or the grid won't keep it's shape. One possible solution is to give .product a fixed height and adjust using media queries.Here is an example I made that works in Safari and other browsers: \nhttp://codepen.io/anon/pen/PZbNMX\nAdditionally, you can use style rules to keep images or description text within a certain size to make things easier to maintain.Another possible solution is to use a script or jQuery plugin to allow for more dynamic uniform sizing, but I'm not as savvy with that stuff.I ran into the same issue when trying to combine flex and Bootstrap using Safari, so I hope this helps.I had the same problem and the answer was that Flex box on safari doesn't seem to like the floats being cleared on the same div that is display: flex. In case you are using display flex with flex-wrap i solved it applying a hight order to the before and after pseudo-elements of the row, so they position as the last elements."},

If there were, we could expect to find it in the CSS3 Text module, but its current draft has nothing like that – just ways to control how allowed line break points are determined.What you can do is to disallow line breaks where they would normally be allowed. Typically, a space implies a line breaking opportunity, but using a no-break space (which can be written as &nbsp; if desired) you forbid that. For example, if you have a heading text like “A bridge across the Irish Sea and four other amazing plans”, then you might say that there is the best line breaking opportunity is after “and”, a good opportunity after “across”, and a rather bad (though permissible) after “Irish”, and so on. But you can’t do that in HTML or CSS, and typically not in typesetting programs either. You can just allow or disallow breaks, e.g. as in <h1>A&nbsp;bridge across the&nbsp;Irish&nbsp;Sea and four&nbsp;other amazing&nbsp;plans</h1>. For headings and headlines, this might make sense, even though it means that you consider each space and decide whether to make it non-breaking.You can put text into spans and prevent line breaks inside them. This way line breaks could only happen between two spans:I definitely understand why you want this, and there have certainly been times that I have looked at a layout and at first thought, wanted the same thing.But I wouldn't be doing due justice if I didn't mention that doing this can cause some major word flow issues.Do you have a responsive website? If so, just changing the size of the viewport on your browser can turn a nice looking line of word broken text into something that looks terrible.And even if you don't have a responsive website, and are using pixel-perfect design, all someone needs to do is change the size of the font and everything will go crazy.I would rethink this decision. Just my opinion, though."},

Read more about these MIME types in RFC 4329.Notice the difference between RFC 4329, that marked text/javascript as obsolete and recommending the use of application/javascript, and the reality in which some browsers freak out on <script> elements containing type=\"application/javascript\" (in HTML source, not the HTTP Content-type header of the file that gets send).

It started as a set of loose guidelines. Since posting this answer, Yandex has significantly overhauled their official standard (it's quite an improvement). The version of BEM I use is based heavily from an article by Nicolas Gallagher.At this point I use \"Atomic OOBEMITLESS\", which is really just a way of saying that classes are modular and namespaced, selectors have low specificity, and states may be toggled with classes which allows CSS to be scaled, on top of a CSS preprocessor to make the code more concise and expressive.All that said, I will be using the following BEM standard:BEM short form: block-name__element-name--modifier-nameYou have three different blocks in your examples:The sidebar and content blocks appear to be variations on the same block, and could be represented as .region.region--sidebar and .region.region--content.The nav block is implicit on the ul element, and you should make it explicit:Once you've specified that the ul element is a nav block, it makes sense to have the nav block be modified:Once you've set up the CSS classes, styling all nav__item elements is simply:and overriding those styles for the content nav__item elements is:You should probably have a look at BEM's FAQ.Whereas the DOM representation of the block may be nested:Besides the fact that the classes look much nicer, it makes the elements be dependent on the block only. So, you can easily move them across the block when providing changes to the interface. The changes of the block DOM structure would not need corresponding changes to the CSS code.Consider idea of _key_value pairs for modifiers (block or element is separated from modifier name with one underscore and its value with another one).That makes sense to distinguish modifiers one from another (e.g. nav_type_content and nav_type_sidebar are both about the place where nav apper on the page but modifiers setting theme, size or making links work via ajax are different) and so to understand which modifiers can't be used together on one DOM-node.Also it's more convenient to work with key: value pairs in javascript.And there are quite a lot of ready-made components and tools which uses such convention: https://github.com/bem/"},

In Javascript, the assignment would look like:orTechnically, this could be done in the template, but the escaping required to keep it valid HTML isn't worth it.More info here:  Is quoting the value of url() really necessary?Binding background image style using a dynamic value from v-for loop could be done like this. Another solution:What makes this solution more convenient?\nFirstly, it's cleaner. And then, if you're using Vue CLI (I assume you do), you can load it by webpack.Note: don't forget that require() is always relative to the current file's path.I experienced an issue where background images with spaces in the filename where causing the style to not be applied.

(I don't think this can be done using pure CSS)the HTML stays the same as you posted, the CSS changes a little bit, JQuery code added.Working Fiddle Tested on: IE10, IE9, IE8, FF, ChromeBTW: if you have unique elements, why don't you use id's instead of classes?\nI think it gives a better selector performance.Explanation of how it works:\ninner-container will span the entire space of the outer-container (so basically, he's not needed) but I left him there, so you wont need to change you DOM.the table-header is relatively positioned, without a scroll (overflow: hidden), we will handle his scroll later.the table-body have to span the rest of the inner-container height, so I used a script to determine what height to fix him. (it changes dynamically when you re-size the window)\nwithout a fixed height, the scroll wont appear, because the div will just grow large instead..\nnotice that this part can be done without script, if you fix the header height and use CSS3 (as shown in the end of the answer)now it's just a matter of moving the header along with the body each time we scroll.\nthis is done by a function assigned to the scroll event.CSS (some of it was copied from your style)JQueryIf you don't care about fixing the header height (I saw that you fixed the cell's height in your CSS), some of the Script can be skiped if you use CSS3 :Shorter Fiddle (this will not work on IE8)Here's a solution which again is not a CSS only solution. It is similar to avrahamcool's solution in that it uses a few lines of jQuery, but instead of changing heights and moving the header along, all it does is changing the width of tbody based on how far its parent table is scrolled along to the right.An added bonus with this solution is that it works with a semantically valid HTML table.It works great on all recent browser versions (IE10, Chrome, FF) and that's it, the scrolling functionality breaks on older versions. But then the fact that you are using a semantically valid HTML table will save the day and ensure the table is still displayed properly, it's only the scrolling functionality that won't work on older browsers.Here's a jsFiddle for demonstration purposes.CSSJSI needed a version which degrades nicely in IE9 (no scrolling, just a normal table).

Try using getChildren().or something like that.The original question was not answered. :only-child only works if the only-child has no descendant children. The original post suggested that the inclusion of descendant children was due to ul>li whereas it is in fact due to a bug in :only-child. Paradoxically :first-child selects the first child in a list with descendant children, as does last-child, but :only-child does not. I checked this in Firefox, Opera and Chrome. Here is an example:To activate :first-child and :last-child rules uncomment the last two items. The implementation of the Selectors Level 3 standard is thus inconsistent in major browsers. The :first-child rule should not be activated when there is an :only-child rule and a unique child has descendants. In the example the only-child should be red but it is green."},

The trick here, is it is the whole of the div that is being filtered, not just the image. If I was to enter some text into the div the text colour would turn green as well.The key in this case is to define an initial color. White nor black or any gray-scale is technically an actual color - you can't saturate or rotate it. You'll have to \"colorize\" it somehow, and the sepia filter is the only filter which do some form of colorizing.It would be easier if your image was pure 100% red. Then you could just add the target degree directly and adjust saturation and lightness using HSL for target. For a white color start point the first step is to convert and define an intermediate color so we can saturate and rotate it later on.Lets first darken the white image and apply sepia to get a \"base\" color we can work with:This will produce RGB color value of approximately:Step two is to convert that to HSL color-space which gives us:These two first steps are static and its result will be reused every time we need to find a target adjustment (the actual value of sepia is defined in the SVG Filters specification).Now we need to calculate what we need to apply to this base color to get target color. First convert target color, for example #689d94 as given in the question, to HSL:Then we have to calculate the difference between those. Hue is calculated by simply subtracting base from target. The same for Saturation and Lightness, but as we assume 100% of the base value we need to subtract the result from 100% to end up with a diff for the accumulated values:Convert those values to a filter-string by appending it to the existing filter, then set it on the div:And to set it you would probably do something like this assuming filter and divElement are already declared:Note that there is likely rounding errors as RGB is represented as integer, while HSL is floating point, so the actual result may not be exact, but it should get pretty close.Viable alternative options are:The accepted answer is wrong. Hue-rotate does not conserve saturation or brightness and you have to do crazy math to come up with the correct values. The far easier way - which will result in a correct result - is to do a CSS filter that references an SVG filter. The feColorMatrix primitive in SVG filters allows you to pick a color directly - like so. Take your color #424242 - divide each color's hex value by #FF (.257) and put them in the fifth column, first three rows of your color matrix. Like so:If svg are being used then ...You can open svg files with some text editor copy and paste to html file then change path color as required.In below example code...

Problems I personally deal with that have left a memorable impression (in no particular order):I will probably add more to this list later, since (to me) the worst part of web development are cross-browser issues.  Also, I doubt I'll ever edit out the \"I will probably add more to this list later\", since these problems are endless.  :)The only one that really gets to me:If you're interested in the issues themselves, QuirksMode.org is an amazing resource I used every day before making the leap to client-side libraries. Also check out John Resig's The DOM is a Mess presentation at yahoo, which gives a lot of theory about how to deal with cross-browser topics efficiently. However, if you're interested in simply having them solved, your question is an excellent example of why many consider using client-side libraries like jQuery, YahooUI, MooTools, Dojo, etc. With a thriving community, talented people and corporate backing projects like those allow you to focus on your app rather than these issues.Here are some jQuery examples that avoid much of the cross-browser frustration and can really make all of this.. fun.Cross-browser mouse click bindingCross-browser HTML InjectionCross-browser Ajax (all request objects are  still made available to you)And what really blows me away, load a data subset with selectors (see manual for details)Now, how all this really starts to get fun: chaining methods togetherReminds me of Joel's Can Your Programming Language Do This? article.Taking all this to a theoretical level, true advancement doesn't come from what you can do with conscious thought and effort, but rather what you can do automatically (without thought or effort). Joel has a segment on this in Smart And Gets Things Done regarding interviewing questions and smart developers, completely changed my approach to programming.Similar to a pianist who can just 'play' the music because she knows all the keys, your advancement comes not from doing more things that require thought but rather more things that require no thought. The goal then becomes making all the basics easy.. natural.. subconscious.. so we can all geek out on our higher level goals.Client side libraries, in a way, help us do just that. ;)IE6? Meh. You guys have got it easy! You've never had to make CSS layout work in Netscape 4 (without crashing the entire browser)? You've never had to write for appliance browsers that don't support tables? You've never had to write for IE Mobile?And this is the most up-to-date release of Microsoft's flagship Windows Mobile browser in 2009.Sure, it supports XMLHttpRequest, but writing AJAX code on a browser whose CSS and script support is less than IE3 (!) is bizarrely schizophrenic, like you're working with a weird amalgam of 21st-century and 19th-century technologies.I wouldn't recommend it.Been doing this too long to have many problems, but it still drives me nuts that I have to hack around IE's non-support for CSS things like display:table, :last-child, and :hover outside of anchors. All the IE stuff is still insane, but it's just background insanity now :)Biggest Cross-Browser Issue? - Internet Explorer!<start_grumpy>IE is solely responsible for \"holding back the web\" - us developers can't create amazing sites using HTML5, or SVG, or XFORMS, or CANVAS... not because of Firefox,Safari or Chrome, but because 2/3s of the Internet is still stuck on IE. Not to mention that ~20% of the web is still stuck on IE6!  IE8 is the first version of IE to at least try to be standards compatible (2001's standards that is), which means it will be at least 2018 before we can finally start dropping all support for IE7.</start_grumpy>Otherwise name a DOM method that IE fully supports... the fact that this is a hard question to answer is my biggest CrossBrowser issue.even things IE invented are messed up...While developing a system tests framework for a web app we had to simulate various events such as clicks. I remember that we couldn't find any normal way to do it in IE and FF and had to implement it in two different ways with a lot of voodoo around.I don't remember the specifics, but I remember that it was really annoying.This, basically.Modern javascript frameworks (jQuery, prototype, etc) have done wonders for getting code working in lots of browsers at once.The biggest problem I have now is the fact that any sort of rich UI behaviour runs amazingly slowly. IE7 is bad. IE6 is worse. IE8 is buggy, half finished, and really no better than IE7.The worst thing is that I don't think we'll ever be free of IE6.  It was so ubiquitous, and so damn quirky. Loads of 'enterprise' (and by that I mean big web apps made by one big company for another big company) applications used highly specific IE6 javascript that doesn't even work in IE7, never mind anything else.Companies can't afford to completely replace these apps - we're trying to sell them new ones and that means IE6 support is mandatory. The way it is right now, with credit-crunched companies cutting costs, I reckon we'll still be supporting IE6 in 2015 :-(In internet explorer (note: older versions of IE, not necessarily versions 9/10+), if you create form elements using document.createElement, the field won't be submitted with the form.  The only workaround is to use In IE, you can not hide select option elements, only the select element itself.  This makes it difficult to dynamically change the contents of select options using Javascript.This problem also exists in Safari and Chrome.There are many other issues with IE, but this one has caused me the most frustration recently.IE's restrictions on using DOM manipulations on tables forced me to take a completely different approach to something. Very frustrating at the start, but the positive out of it was that the second approach was ultimately better, so I suppose I should be grateful to IE. ;)Actually all of those are W3C DOM methods supported by the vast majority of browsers. I think you'll find they also work in IE.My biggest cross-browser issue is that there are people out there still using IE.Second biggest is that even in standards-following browsers, doing some things in CSS is still impossible; for instance tbody {overflow:auto} does nothing useful in anything but Gecko, and even there it has bugs.Firefox and IE ahve different table setups in the DOM, in one, all siblings of a cell are the other cells, whilst the other has elements between the cells.  I can't remember which way around it is, but it gave me a real headache in one application.My biggest problem are browser makers. Arrogant little *^&%s. I mean, you can't sell a browser to anybody, yet everyone is in their little corner trying to out do each other, only creating division. Oh and Chrome. Chrome still doesn't know what it wants to be, Safari or Firefox. Aside from its one parlor trick, its practically useless. I blame all you guys who kept googling just because you hate monopolies. Guess what, they're the monopoly now. Now we can all enjoy second rate, prematurely launched software.This mostly stems from a bug* I had in Chrome today, it never dawned on me to query the browser. Both Safari and Chrome were failing so I figured hey, once I fixed the Safari problem Chrome would be fixed automatically, but oh no no. Mr.\"I run tabs in seperate processes\" AKA \"Sr. No full screen\" just had to hold me in the lizard lock with its mind boggling implementation.I also detest Firefox. I can't tell whether I have a virus infestation or Firebug running. Now until Adobe decides to release a browser that makes Flash practical for things other than movie clips I'm pretty much going to have something to bitch about for a long time. And we all know that's what life is all about.Also, I only enjoy programming when I encounter ridiculous bugs that make my brain juices run. Inconsistencies in the CSS box model when dealing with forms. In particular it's irritating how each browser handles the <select> Boxmy only nightmare is IE6 you should always look for hacks but everytime you face a problem with it there is someone who ran into it before you and blogged about it (and we will never get away from it )I was working on CSS layout written by someone who thought that the size given to an element is size+padding+border like in IE5 and not only the content box as explained in official specification. It was written only a few month ago so he did dirty hacks to make it look well in IE7. It took me several hours with FireBug to track down the source of the problem and by the time I realized it I was really annoyed.If you open site with \"floating\" CSS written for IE5 in Firefox the boxes just do not have enough space to fit and fall down the page. If you open it in IE7 it looks nice as IE7 lets the borders overlap so it looks almost correct. For someone as inexperienced as me it was hard to note.To remove iframe borders in Internet Explorer you have to specify the frameborder attribute as camelCase format, which is non xhtml compliant.An easy way to help with the pesky IE display issues is to use firebug, Yep enen in IE 6/7/8 Just use Firebug LiteIf you add the following as a bookmark and stick it on your tool bar it will enable firebug lite off any webpage with a single click. (only check this in IE and it works fine.)"},

What are the implications of my new approach? Does it effect browser performance in any regard? I'm not aware of any performance difference between display:none and visibility:hidden - even if there is, for as little as 10 elements it will be completely negligible.  Your main concern should be, as you say, whether you want the elements to remain within the document flow, in which case visibility is a better option as it maintains the box model of the element.display:none; elements are not in the render tree all, so they will perform better at face value.I doubt you will have any real visible performance problems from this though. If you  need opacity: 0 or visibility: hidden because of their functionality, then just use them. If you don't need the functionality, then use display: none;If you are toggling between visible and invisible states via javascript then visibility:hidden should be the better performer. Seeing as it always takes up the same amount of space in both visible and hidden states it won't cause a reflow of the elements below it every time you make it appear of disappear. For display:none you are removing it from the flow of the document and then when you set it to display:block you are rerendering it and pushing everything below that element down, essentially laying all that stuff out again.But if you are doing something like toggling visible states on button presses then you really should be using what suits your needs rather than what performs better, as the performance differences are negligible in such cases. When you are animating with the dom at around 20 times per second THEN you can worry about the performance of visibility:hidden vs display:none.visibility: hidden does not cause a re-flow on the document, while display: none does. display: none: The HTML engine will completely ignore the element and its children. The engine will not ignore elements marked with visibility: hidden, it will do all the calculations to the element and its children, the exception is that the element will not be rendered to the viewport.If the values for position and dimensions properties are needed then visibility: hidden have to be used and you have to handle the white space in the viewport, usually by wrapping that element inside another one with 0 width and height and 'overflow: hidden'. display:none will remove the element from the document's normal flow and set the values for position/height/width to 0 on the element and its children. When the elements display property is changed to other value than none, it triggers a complete document re-flow, which can be a problem for big documents - and sometimes not-so-big documents being rendered on hardware with limited capabilities. display: none is the natural and logical solution to use when hiding elements on the viewport, visibility: hidden should be used as a fallback, where/when needed.EDIT:\nAs pointed by @Juan, display: none is the choice to go when what you need is to add many elements to the DOM tree. visibility: hidden will trigger a re-flow for each element added to the tree, while display: none will not. Well, the main performance difference between display: block and visibility: hidden is that if you have a list of, say, 100000 elements, the visibility: hidden won't save you from DOM hanging because it doesn't remove elements from DOM.\nvisibility: hidden acts like opacity: 0 + pointer-events: none. display: none acts like Element.remove().Live example: https://jsfiddle.net/u2dou58r/10/From personal experience having just tried both on a simple static page with a form located beneath a \"hidden\" button, visibility: hidden performs flawlessly whereas display: none causes clickable buttons to slightly jump upon clicking, as if it tries to show the hidden button for a millisecond. Well, visibility:none still uses the space of the div.\nSo you could maybe skip the positioning part because its place is already allocated (and by that get a better performance).But I somehow guess that you need your display:none approach to allocate space correctly when the \"show\" event is triggered.I think this could be somehow related to this question: CSS Properties: Display vs. VisibilityI'll just quote the interesting part:So there should be no real difference in regard to browser performance, because both versions are still in the DOM hierarchy. These properties only affect how an element is displayed in regards to the DOM."},

It has less characters, takes up less space, and is easier to remember.Are there any down sides to using color names over hex codes or RGB values? This includes programming in a multi-developer environment.Different browsers may not agree on what some color names mean. There are not names for all 16 million 24-bit colors. In fact there are only 17 W3C-standard color names. It's probably OK to use those.Personally I use a templating system at build time to pre-process my CSS files, so that I can keep a standard set of site colors and refer to them by name. That way I get the best of both worlds: I know exactly what my RGB color values are, but I can use simpler names in the CSS.(Of course, it's still not possible to know exactly how a color will look on a given user's browser.)edit — in the 5 years since this answer was written, preprocessors like Less and Sass have become pretty common. Those provide some very sophisticated tools for managing colors (and many other things) in CSS sources.I recommend that you follow the W3C recommendations:All of them (CSS Level 1, Level 2 and Level 3) indicate that using color names is perfectly acceptable, but which ones are acceptible varies depending on the specification.CSS1 Specification recommends to use color names as a valid substitute to hex codes and RGB codes.You can use the color name orange now! The count is up to 17 colors. CSS2 Specification for reference.CSS3 allows for SVG 1.0's X11 colors to be used for CSS's properties (as well as hsl() values). This expands the amount of color names to 147 colors. Any of these color names can be used in any browser that supports the SVG 1.0 specification, which is IE9 or newer.This also means that the list of colors provided in the question are mostly not valid.If you're seeking to support legacy browsers stick to the web safe original 16 color names since X11 colors are not supported. Otherwise, you are free to use any of the 147 color names specified in the X11 spec.All browsers should abide by the specification in reference to the equivalent hex codes. The time it takes the parser to read the color names is virtually, if not exactly, the same as using a hex value, an rgb value, or an hsl() value.To me, it's more readable to write your HEX codes in lowercase. For example, #8b88b6 is obviously more readable than #8B88B6. Also, I tend to use shorthand HEX color instead of full code (#666 instead of #666666) since it's more efficient.personally, i prefer using hexcodes because of 2 reasonsThis assumes you're using colors other that the simple red, black, white etc. In a multi-developer environment, i'd say hexcodes are better because they're more universally consistent (every developer knows exactly what the color is).The previous answers look outdated by now. If you develop for browsers that support CSS3, which are all major browsers since IE9, you can use color names in CSS. In HTML, only the 16 original web colors are supported.The question was if there are downsides. I think there are a few:Sources:\nhttps://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/color_value and\nhttp://caniuse.com/#search=css3%20colorsI prefer a further optimization, #c00 for red.  If you are going to use a primary color, or any color that is similar to #aabbcc, you can use shorthand, #abc.I use color names for prototyping, debugging, and to set up really basic, monochromatic color schemes which are then ripe for theming with hyper-specific hex colors. It makes a theme-able property easy to spot. It's also more human readable; less brain strain when trying to instantly visualize what's going on....then in theming file...It really comes down to your coding style.  I stick to hex values for consistency - a color is always formatted as #000 or #000000, and I don't have to worry about switching between namd and unnamed colors.In the end, it's a decision you and your team will have to make on your own.  It's all about your preferences.Personally, I prefer all colours in a CSS file to be defined in the same way, if possible.That way I don’t have to think in a different way when I see different colours defined (e.g. red, #cd876f and rgba(255,255,0,0.4)).I also prefer colour notations that match what I’ll see when identifying the colour in the design I’m implementing. Photoshop’s colour palette gives RGB and hex values, amongst others, but doesn’t give CSS colour names. (Other design tools might do though.)I think color names are more descriptive... And this is a good reason for using it when possible.in my opinion it's a matter of preference.  if the color is as simple as red, black, grey, blue, white etc.  ill use the word instead of the hex."},

You can either use an external compiler, or install an extension so you can compile your LESS files from within the IDE.If you don't want to install plugins in your Visual Studio, you can use an external compiler.Currently I'm using Koala, every time you save your LESS file he will compile it automatically in your output folder.

The corresponding .css, .min.css and css.map files are automatically generated and appear nested under the .less file in Solution Explorer.Easy:Afterwards the resulting .css file will be generated on every file save.Another small tool to compile LESS after it has been saved is WinLess.Not much options but small and simple. And it does the job!http://www.winless.org/Don't know what the experience of other users is, but WebEssentials 2013 does not work well on my machine with Visual Studio 2013 (Ultimate) and the settings, well...

I don't care about horizontal scrolling anyway, so it's fine if a solution doesn't do that.This answer will be used as a placeholder for the not fully supported position: sticky and will be updated over time. It is currently advised to not use the native implementation of this in a production environment.See this for the current support: https://caniuse.com/#feat=css-stickyAn alternative answer would be using position: sticky. As described by W3C:This described exactly the behavior of a relative static header. It would be easy to assign this to the <thead> or the first <tr> HTML-tag, as this should be supported according to W3C. However, both Chrome, IE and Edge have problems assigning a sticky position property to these tags. There also seems to be no priority in solving this at the moment.What does seem to work for a table element is assigning the sticky property to a table-cell. In this case the <th> cells.Because a table is not a block-element that respects the static size you assign to it, it is best to use a wrapper element to define the scroll-overflow.In this example I use a simple <div> wrapper to define the scroll-overflow done with a static height of 150px. This can of course be any size. Now that the scrolling box has been defined, the sticky <th> elements will corespondent \"to the nearest ancestor with a scrolling box\", which is the div-wrapper.Non-supported devices can make use of a polyfill, which implements the behavior through code. An example is stickybits, which resembles the same behavior as the browser's implemented position: sticky.Example with polyfill: http://jsfiddle.net/7UZA4/6957/Surprised a solution using flexbox hasn't been posted yet.Here's my solution using display: flex and a basic use of :after (thanks to Luggage) to maintain the alignment even with the scrollbar padding the tbody a bit. This has been verified in Chrome 45, Firefox 39, and MS Edge. It can be modified with prefixed properties to work in IE11, and further in IE10 with a CSS hack and the 2012 flexbox syntax.Note the table width can be modified; this even works at 100% width.The only caveat is that all table cells must have the same width. Below is a clearly contrived example, but this works fine when cell contents vary (table cells all have the same width and word wrapping on, forcing flexbox to keep them the same width regardless of content). Here is an example where cell contents are different.Just apply the .scroll class to a table you want scrollable, and make sure it has a thead:As far as I know, there is no standard way to achieve this with only CSS, although I think there should be. Mozilla browsers used to support fixed headers with a scrolling body, but they've removed it in the last few years.After researching this a bit, including finding this posting, a friend just developed this solution for me; it uses Javascript but no canned libraries, and the only requirement for the HTML markup is that the table have an id name. Then, at window.onload, to call one Javascript function for each table giving the id, height, and width. If Javascript is disabled at the browser, the whole table is displayed according to its original markup. If Javascript is enabled, the table is fit into the specified height and width, and tbody scrolls, and if thead and tfoot exist, they are fixed at top and bottom.Inspired by @Purag's answer, here's another flexbox solution:Ive achieved this easily using this code :So you have a structure like this :just style the thead with :Three things to consider : First, this property is new. It’s not supported at all, apart from the beta builds of Webkit-based browsers. So caveat formator. Again, if you really want for your users to benefit from sticky headers, go with a javascript implementation.Second, if you do use it, you’ll need to incorporate vendor prefixes. Perhaps position: sticky will work one day. For now, though, you need to use position:-webkit-sticky (and the others; check the block of css further up in this post).Third, there aren’t any positioning defaults at the moment, so you need to at least include top: 0; in the same css declaration as the position:-webkit-sticky. Otherwise, it’ll just scroll off-screen.If you have the option of giving a fixed width to the table cells (and a fixed height to the header), you can used the position: fixed option:http://jsfiddle.net/thundercracker/ZxPeh/23/You would just have to stick it in an iframe. You could also have horizontal scrolling by giving the iframe a scrollbar (I think).Edit 2015If you can live with a pre-defining the width of your table cells (by percentage), then here's a bit more elegant (CSS-only) solution:http://jsfiddle.net/7UBMD/77/Only with CSS : CSS:Bootply : http://www.bootply.com/AgI8LpDuglI see this thread has been inactive for a while, but this topic interested me and now with some CSS3 selectors, this just became easier (and pretty doable with only CSS). This solution relies on having a max height of the table container. But it is supported as long as you can use the :first-child selector.Fiddle here.If anyone can improve on this answer, please do! I plan on using this solution in a commercial app soon!HTMLCSSI had the same problem and after spending 2 days researching I found this solution from Ksesocss that fits for me and maybe is good for you too. It allows fixed header and dynamic width and only uses CSS. The only problem is that the source is in spanish but you can find the html and css code there.This is the link:http://ksesocss.blogspot.com/2014/10/responsive-table-encabezado-fijo-scroll.htmlI hope this helpsif it gets rock hard where all the mentioned solutions don't work (as it got for me), try a two-tabled solutioned, as I explained in this answerhttps://stackoverflow.com/a/47722456/6488361As I was recently in need of this, I will share a solution that uses 3 tables, but does not require JavaScript.Table 1 (parent) contains two rows. The first row contains table 2 (child 1) for the column headers. The second row contains table 3 (child 2) for the scrolling content.It must be noted the childTbl must be 25px shorter than the parentTbl for the scroller to appear properly.This is the source, where I got the idea from. I made it HTML5-friendly without the deprecated tags and the inline CSS.This is reliable on different browsers, the downside would be having to hard code the table widths.I was trying to figure this out myself recently, and I came up with a good solution that works perfectly in my browser (Chrome 51) and supports dynamic column widths. I should mention that after I independently derived my answer I also found a similar technique described elsewhere on the web...The trick is to use two identical tables positioned on top of one another. The lower table is visible and the upper table is invisible expect for the header. The upper table also has pointer-events: none set on the tbody so mouse interactions hit the underneath table. This way the lower table scrolls under the upper table's header.For everything to layout and resize properly (when the user adjusts screen width for instance), both tables need to have the same scrollbar behavior. However, the upper table's scroll bar is ignored thanks to the pointer-events: none and can be made invisible with: Here is the complete code:Caveats: More work is required to prove this works in other browsers. Also I was rather liberal in mixing inline and stylesheet styles. However I believe the general concept is the best way of doing this since if the target browser supports it. The only functionality/display issues are that if you want a horizontal scroll bar, the vertical scroll bar can get scrolled out of view (as shown in the snippet). You can still scroll with the mouse wheel though. Additionally you can't have a transparent background on the header (otherwise the underneath table would show through). Finally you need a way to generate two identical tables. Personally I am using react.js and it is easy to do it with react, but php or other server-side generation or javascript will also work.Another implementation but without any overflow on tbody and dynamic columns. Requires JavaScript though. A container div is used to house the column headings. When the table is scrolled past the view port, a fixed header appears at the top. If table is scrolled horizontally, the fixed header scrolls as well.Column headings are created using span elements with display: inline-block and a negative margin is used to scroll header horizontally. Also optimized using RequestAnimationFrame to avoid any jank.https://codepen.io/lloydleo/pen/NRpqEE"},

As far as I know, the :disabled pseudo-class was introduced in Selectors 3, which makes the pseudo-class newer.Yes, to some extent.With an attribute selector, you're relying on the knowledge that the document you're styling makes use of a disabled attribute to indicate disabled fields. Theoretically, if you were styling something that wasn't HTML, disabled fields might not be represented using a disabled attribute, e.g. it might be enabled=\"false\" or something like that. Even future editions of HTML could introduce new elements that make use of different attributes to represent enabled/disabled state; those elements wouldn't match the [disabled] attribute selector.The :disabled pseudo-class decouples the selector from the document you're working with. The spec simply states that it targets elements that are disabled, and that whether an element is enabled, disabled, or neither, is defined by the document language instead:In other words, when you use the pseudo-class, the UA automatically figures out which elements to match based on the document you're styling, so you don't have to tell it how.In terms of the DOM, I believe setting the disabled property on a DOM element also modifies the HTML element's disabled attribute, which means there's no difference between either selector with DOM manipulation. I'm not sure if this is browser-dependent, but here's a fiddle that demonstrates it in the latest versions of all major browsers:You're most likely going to be styling HTML, so none of this may make any difference to you, but if browser compatibility isn't an issue I would choose :enabled and :disabled over :not([disabled]) and [disabled] simply because the pseudo-classes carry semantics that the attribute selector does not. I'm a purist like that.It turns out that Internet Explorer 10 and 11 fail to recognize the :disabled pseudoclass on some elements and only works fine with the attribute selector syntax.The code snipped above renders in IE like this:As long as you're only styling input elements, you should be fine either way. Still it's a good advice to test the final result in all browsers you wish to support."},

Is there an alternative to ::ng-deep?FWIW In my research I have not found any replacement for ng-deep or the other applicable alternatives. This is because, I believe, the Angular team is deferring to the W3C spec on the shadow dom, which initially had selectors such as deep. However, the W3c has since removed the recommendation, but not replaced it with a new one. Until that happens, I imagine that the Angular team will keep ::ng-deep and it's alternatives available, but in deprecated state due to the pending state of W3C's drafts. I am not able to take the time to find the documentation to back this up right now but I did see it recently.Long story short: Keep using ::ng-deep and its alternatives until a replacement is created - the deprecation is just an early notice so that people aren't blindsided whenever the actual change materializes.-- UPDATE --https://drafts.csswg.org/css-scoping-1/\nHere is the draft proposal if you're interested. It appears that they are working on a robust set of selectors for elements within a shadow dom tree; it is this spec, once approved, that I think will inform the angular clone, if there even is one (i.e. angular may not need to implement their own selectors once this goes live in browsers).To bypass the deprecated ::ng-deep, I usually disable ViewEncapsulation. Although this is not the best approach, it has served me well.To disable ViewEncapsulation, do the following in your component:This will make the .scss styles in this component global to the whole application. To not allow the styles to go up the chain to parent and sibling components, wrap the whole scss with the selector like so:Now, the styles specified here will go down to children components so you have to be extra specific with your css selectors and mind your p's and q's when adding CSS (maybe add the child selector specified in your Angular app and then its styles).I say it is not the best approach because of the paragraph above, but this has served me well.The simple and easy alternative to a deep style is a common style using the element selector of the parent component.  So if you had this in hero-details.component.css:It would become this in styles.css:Basically a deep style is an un-encapsulated style so it conceptually seems more like a common style to me than a component style.  Personally I would not use deep styles anymore.   Breaking changes are normal in major version updates and deprecated feature removal is fair game.This is not a general replacement for ::ng-deep, but for the use case described by the question author:In the special case where you want to style the element inserted by a router-outlet, there is an elegant solution using the adjacent neighbor selector in CSS:This will apply to all elements which are direct neighbors of a router-outlet.Further reading:\nhttps://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Adjacent_sibling_combinator\nhttps://angular.io/guide/router#router-outletAs someone stated before, if you're using a third party library it's virtually impossible to avoid having to use ::ng-deep once in a while. But what are you going to do about your previous projects when the ::ng-deep became no longer supported by browsers?To be ready for that moment I will suggest the following:To avoid changing the default encapsulation, I wrote a helper that append global styles for the component:deepStyle.tsmy-component.tsresult:"},

I have 6 more years experience of dealing with button now, and browsers have somewhat moved on from IE6 and IE7.  So I'll add an answer that details what I found out and what I suggest.Answering from an ASP.NET perspective.I was excited when I found this question and some code for a ModernButton control, which, in the end, is a <button> control.So I started adding all sorts of these buttons, decorated with <img /> tags inside of them to make them stand out.  And it all worked great... in Firefox, and Chrome.Then I tried IE6 and got the \"a potentially dangerous Request.Form value was detected\", because IE6 submits the html inside of the button, which, in my case, has html tags in it.  I don't want to disable the validateRequest flag, because I like this added bit of data validation.So then I wrote some javascript to disable that button before the submit occurred.  Worked great in a test page, with one button, but when I tried it out on a real page, that had other <button> tags, it blew up again.  Because IE6 submits ALL of the buttons' html.  So now I have all sorts of code to disable buttons before submit.Same problems with IE7.  IE8 thankfully has this fixed.Yikes.  I'd recommend not going down this road IF you are using ASP.NET.Update:I found a library out there that looks promising to fix this.If you use the ie8.js script from this library: http://code.google.com/p/ie7-js/It might work out just fine.  The IE8.js brings IE5-7 up to speed with IE8 with the button tag. It makes the submitted value the real value and only one button gets submitted.When using <button> always specify the type, since browsers default to different types.This will work consistently across all browser:This way you gain all of <button>'s goodness, no downsides.Everything you need to know: W3Schools <button> TagPros:Cons:From https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/button:An important quirk to be aware of: In a form that contains a <button/> element, IE6 and IE7 will not submit the form when the <button/> element is clicked. Other browsers, on the other hand, will submit the form.In contrast, no browsers will submit the form when <input type=\"button\"/> or <button type=\"button\"/> elements are clicked. And naturally, all browsers will submit the form when <input type=\"submit\"/> or <button type=\"submit\"/> elements are clicked.As @orip's answer says, to get consistent submit behavior across browsers, always use <button type=\"button\" /> or <button type=\"submit\" /> inside a <form/> element. Never leave out the type attribute.I've had some experience with the quirks of <button> now, 6 years later, so here are my suggestions:Note that: Using a button-mimic class, like Bootstrap's .btn allows you to just make things like <div> or <a> or even <button> look exactly the way you want it to, and in the case of <a> have a more useful fallback behavior.  Not a bad option.Is it broken or not:As usual, the answer is \"it works fine in all major browsers, but has the following quirks in IE.\" I don't think it will be a problem for you though.The <button> tag is supported by all the major browsers. The only support problem lies in what Internet Explorer will submit upon pressing a button.The major browsers will submit the content of the value attribute. Internet exploter will submit the text between the <button> and </button> tags, while also submitting the value of every other one in the form, instead just the one you clicked.For your purposes, just cleaning up old HTML, this shouldn't be a problem.Sources:Here's a site that explains the differences:\nhttp://www.javascriptkit.com/howto/button.shtmlBasically, the input tag allows just text (although you can use a background image) while the button allows you to add images, tables, divs and whatever else. Also, it doesn't require it to be nested within a form tag.You might also run into these problems:Another thing is related to styling it using the sliding-door technique: you need to insert another tag e.g. <span> to make it work.as far as I am concerned the difference between submit and button tags is this: \n gives you the option to have different text displayed than the element's valueLet's say you have a list of products then next to each product you want a button to add it to the customer's cart:then you could do this:Now the problem is that IE will send the form with value=\"add to cart\" instead of value=\"product2\"The easiest way to workaroound this issue is by adding onclick=\"this.value='product2'\"So this:will do the trick on all major browsers - I have actually used this on a form with multiple buttons and works with Chrome Firefox and IELooks like the main reason to use <button> is to allow for CSS markup of that button and the ability to style the button with images: (see here: http://www.javascriptkit.com/howto/button.shtml)However, I think the more adopted approach I've seen in (X)HTML + CSS is to use a div and style it completely with images and :hover pseudo-classes (simulating button downpress... can't add more than one link per answer, so just google \"div button\" you'll see lots of examples of this), and using javascript to do form submission or AJAX call... this also makes even more sense if you don't use HTML forms, and do all submissions with AJAX."},

The property needed is:Which has solved my problem.  Yay!I don't know, the solutions here seem partially right, but then don't really work. Based on Josh Stodola's answer, here's a cross-browser solution tested in Firefox, Safari, Chrome and IE 7, 8 & 9CSS:Markup:To add IE6 support (sigh), add _height: [yourvalue] to the div. Yes, with an underscore.Test it yourself on JSFiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/atp4B/2/Hint: don't use DIVs for text blocks (for SEO and a better semantic purposes)Here's an example I made of exactly what your looking for:\n(jsFiddled here: http://jsfiddle.net/yohphomu/)Warning: If I understand your question correctly, there is no need to set a height or width because their default setting is auto (that being said you can use auto), but the only problem with this is that if you wanted to change the background or put a border it will make it around more than the desired field. Why is that and how do we fix it, read on.Any one having this problem hasn't realized on thing (assuming you have this problem and are using div's) anything between div tags is considered (for understanding purposes) a complete set, meaning that in that div is all the things you want it to stand for (computers do what they're told, not what you want them to do) so (for example) in order to set the text-align to center it needs that whole lines space and (ultimately) if it had a border, it would border all the space it used. If you understand this read on, if not well can't help you there.So now that we understand what happens, how do we fix it? Well we need one part to center it, the other to color it. In my example I used a div to center it and span to color. Did I need the div? I'm am positive I did not. I could have achieved the same thing by using the p to center (or I could get rid of the p and just use div). The reason I did this was to keep it organized.Hope this answered your question. Took you 4 years for an answer but me, 30 mins to figure it out (and I've been studying CSS for a few days now).The Example:Then css would look like:Notice: I set the container with set width and height because I was working on a project at the same time and to simulate a full screen with text.Also note that I have made it so that that the text has a separate background color with a border. I did this to show its measurements are independent and rescale when needed.I recommend flexbox! See what's possible at this website, solved by flexbox.It's quite new but works in all the major modern browsers (IE10 uses -ms- prefix, IE11+, Firefox 31+, Chrome 31+, Safari 7+, ...) - see this chart.Basically, vertical and horizontal centering, complete with dynamic sizing, can be accomplished in 4 statements:Make sure this parent actually is 100% height. You may need to set body and html to 100% height too.My implementation of this can be seen at my own personal website, http://pgmann.cf.Something like this?HTMLCSS"},

Can anyone please tell me how can I do all this?There are several things you need to take into account of which one or more might be relevant you your specific caseYou need to ensure that your CSS is loaded after the PrimeFaces one. You can achieve this by placing the <h:outputStylesheet> referencing your CSS file inside <h:body> instead of <h:head>:JSF will automatically relocate the stylesheet to the end of the generated HTML <head> and this will thus ensure that the stylesheet is loaded after the PrimeFaces' default styles. This way the selectors in your CSS file which are exactly the same as in PrimeFaces CSS file will get precedence over the PrimeFaces one.You'll probably also see suggestions to put it in <f:facet name=\"last\"> of <h:head> which is understood by PrimeFaces-specific HeadRenderer, but this is unnecessarily clumsy and would break when you have your own HeadRenderer.You also need to ensure that your CSS selector is at least as specific as the PrimeFaces' default CSS selector on the particular element. You need to understand CSS Specificity and Cascading and Inheritance rules. For example, if PrimeFaces declares a style by default as followsand you declare it asand the particular element with class=\"ui-bar\" happen to have a parent element with class=\"ui-foo\", then the PrimeFaces' one will still get precedence because that's the most specific match! You can use the webbrowser developer tools to find the exact CSS selector. Rightclick the element in question in the webbrowser (IE9/Chrome/Firefox+Firebug) and choose Inspect Element to see it.If you need to override a style for only a specific instance of the component and not all instances of the same component, then add a custom styleClass and hook on that instead. It is another case where specificity is used/applied. For example: If a component does not support a styleClass and you are on jsf 2.2 or up, you can also use passtrough attributes and add a pt:class and have it end-up on the output.In case you fail to properly load the CSS file in order or to figure the right CSS selector, you'll probably grab the !important workaround. This is Plain Wrong. It's an ugly workaround and not a real solution. It only confuses your style rules and yourself more in long term. The !important should only be used in order to override the values hardcoded in HTML element's style attribute from a CSS stylesheet file on (which is in turn also a bad practice, but in some rare cases unfortunately unavoidable).you can create a new css file for example cssOverrides.cssand place all the overrides you want inside it, that way upgrading the primefaces version wont affect you , and in your h:head add something like that if it wont work try adding it to the h:bodyin order to check if its working try this simple example inside the css filethis will reduce the size of all primefaces components /textI'm using PrimeFaces 6.0. Here's some information I would have liked to have regarding this:If you use <h:outputStylesheet/>, it will work, but your CSS will not be loaded last even if it's last in the <h:head></h:head> tags (other CSS files will be included afterwards). A trick you can do which I learned from here is to place it inside <f:facet name=\"last\"></f:facet>, which must go inside the body, like so:Then your CSS will be the last loaded. Note: you will still have to adhere to the specificity rules as BalusC outlined.I placed \"MyCSS.css\" in WebContent/resources/css/.More information on the resource loading order: http://www.mkyong.com/jsf2/primefaces/resource-ordering-in-primefacesThe style rules used by PrimeFaces can be quite complex. An element can receive its styling from multiple CSS rules. It's good to know you can use filtering in the DOM inspector's style tab to search on the property you want to customise:This screenshot was taken using Chrome, but filtering is also available in Firefox and Safari.When you have found the rule you want to customise, you can simply create a more specific rule by prefixing it with html. For example, your could override .ui-corner-all like:I usually just want to replace some color with another value. As colors can be used in many different rules it can be useful to create a ResourceHandler.In the handler check for the PrimeFaces theme:In the resource, replace the color:And register it as follows in the faces-config.xml:For more information on resource handlers see:"},

In fact, every dimension in my company site ( http://kingdesk.com ) is em based. In all my recent work, I have abandoned such practice for four reasons:I now design exclusively in fixed units, and have never once had a problem or complaint.Oh, and if you're wondering, I no longer try to make sites look pixel perfect in IE6. They are still navigable, and decent looking. But time moves on and 9 year old browsers receive the attention they are due.This article posted in \"A List Apart\" by Richard Rutter is still relevant,How to Size Text in CSS\nhttp://www.alistapart.com/articles/howtosizetextincss/If you look at the iterations, you'll see that,Text size in pixels – iteration 1Text size in ems – iteration 2Body sized as percentage – iteration 3Setting line height in pixels – iteration 4Setting line height in ems – iteration 5The Safari monospace problem – iteration 6Even though this article is dated 2007, it's still very much relevant.  Setting font sizes is more than just setting an em (or px).Don't use em when you really mean %. The only reason em works is because in CSS 1em which is suppose to represent the size of the letter \"M\" (em comes from \"M\") is actually equivalent to the font size. So when you're writing 1em you are actually writing \"100% of inherited font-size\". The em is meant to be used when specifying box dimensions relative to the font-size (which is rare, really really rare).This hole \"you can't re-size it in browser\" is a modern day myth that dates back to the stone age, when browsers text resizing was a frontend feature and thus there was still some truth to it. Will my layout magically not break if I use ems? Of course not, that's just wishful thinking!Do modern browsers offer text zoom? In short: not by default. Browsers offer a page zoom by default, and this is buried deep inside the menu bar usually under view. You can expect some of your users to know the shortcut Ctrl+MouseWheel but actual text zoom is more tricky. With the modern trend of doing away with the menu bar (note: as of this writing FF4 beta also does away with it, by default) you should consider users requiring text zoom are those in real need of it. I say this because the trend of tutorials/advice on the net is to simply glorify elastic layout and being able to re-size text but not really the issue. Sadly too many \"professionals\" in elastic/em/fluid layouts completely miss the point: site should look okey if I zoom to 300% or higher! If it just looks good at things like 130% or 170% that's completely pointless and waste of effort and only really useful when they were stupid enough to set their base font to something like 10px or lower (way too small for large bodies of text).The other issue is \"some browsers don't zoom\", out of those IE6 is the only relevant one, because it still holds some small share of the internet. If you think otherwise, you've probably been reading some articles from 2002 or so (ie. 1 years after it's introduction), wake up to reality:It may also be useful to know the current trend (as per sites like Google) is kill IE6 asap! You are by no means being professional by supporting this cursed browser from almost a decade ago, along with other monstrosities such as IE5.5. Before reading advice in web design, check the date.Rule of thumb: always write what you mean in the context with the most concise syntax.User who need bigger text are users with poor vision. Poor vision should not be confused with being totally blind when text is of a certain size. Given how wide the types of eye problems are, typically offering a small increase in size such as say 130% or 160% or so, is just no where near enough. You are just trying to be fancy, and it doesn't work at all!What you want is to give your users the ability to resize the text they wish to read. And the recommendation is to offer a simple A/A (2nd \"A\" should be smaller; complementing it with text such as \"normal\", \"2x larger\", etc., is useful). Place this somewhere visible, the most common position is in the right top corner of the content the user wishes to read. The context of \"content\" is very important:  If you must make your entire site \"elastic\" (ie. dynamic based on font-size)  Note: extremely large font sizes are not the rare ones, its the other way around. Typically the preferred sizes are 12px (don't have anything lower for base, ever!), 16px and just monster large.Although allowed, I've always felt it's a little nonsensical to size your fonts using em. When used for font sizing, it's a relative measure, and I think it just adds confusion to your CSS. If you really mean to give your font a size relative to it's parent font size, use percents. (font-size: 0.8em is equivalent to font-size: 80%, but the percent is more sensical.)Otherwise use one of the absolute units. Browsers handle and scale them fine now.Ems are very relevant for keeping your layout in proportion. 1em is, in digital typography, the size of the design space for each letter and is equivalent to the point size of the font, e.g. if the current font is 12pt then 1em is 12pt.Percentages and Ems are not interchangeable - whilst it may or may not be preferable to specify a font-size relative to the parent as 80% rather than 0.8em, for example, the same doesn't hold true for anywhere else. If I want a 1em margin around an element that's entirely different from specifying 100%, which in that case would be relative to the amount of space the element occupies.Specifying absolute units will throw the design into chaos. If a user chooses to enlarge their font, some browsers may not scale the text - and nor should they, pixel size should be independent of point size. There is also the issue that if you use relative sizes for fonts and absolute sizes for other measurements then your design will probably die a horrible death, so you should therefore specify all measurements relatively where possible, which means using ems. Browsers that confuse \"enlarge font size\" with \"magnify this web page\" on the grounds that \"the user wants to see everything bigger and it will keep the page how the designer intended\" are wrong, no matter how helpful it may seem. It's things like that which caused HTML to be such a huge mess in the first place.I also don't see the merit in specify a body font-size of 62.5% - whilst it may make measurements easier because 1em = 10px, there are a couple of problems. First, you are still technically working in pixels, and secondly it assumes that the user's default font-size is 16px. If you rely on this ratio anywhere in your layout (such as matching image sizes), your design may suffer should the user have a different default font size, and if you are not relying on it and everything is relative then the font-size doesn't matter because everything will scale to match.So yes, ems are still worthwhile.Sizing fonts in ems doesn't really make much sense, because 1 em is the font size, by definition.Sizing other elements in ems is critical, because it means that when you decide to change the font size, you don't end up completely hosing all your margins, padding, and other layout aspects.I never use pixel sizes for fonts in any program (except Photoshop I suppose, since it just had it in pixels by default). I've always used point size (such as in Word) and have since moved to scaling relatively in CSS with em. I set the body font-size then scale using em.Maybe I'm just used to knowing how big point sizes are on screen and in print. I can never guess the size of a pixel font height so I don't use it."},

It was originally thought for simple code snippets like i++ or <code>.<pre> \"represents a block of preformatted text, in which structure is represented by typographic conventions rather than by elements\". It's original purpose was nothing more than exactly this: provide a text in the same way it was given by the author, e.g.You don't need to use each with each other. <pre> has its own roles, like <code> has its own. However, <pre> is a way to signalize that the white-space in the given fragment is important, a role that <code> is missing.However, back to your question: note the exact wording:It says could, not should. You're free to do this how you want. It's not recommended by the W3C in any way, however, I personally recommend you to use <pre><code>....Whenever white-space is part of your code and the structure of your code, you should state that this structure should be kept. As the structure in code is given by typographic conventions (tabs, linefeeds, spaces) I personally recommend you to use <pre><code>, even if it's arguably more code and another node in the DOM. But whenever missing white-space will render your code imperfect it's necessary.Apart from that you can easily differ between inline code and code-blocks without checking element.className, and some JS syntax highlighter work pretty well with <pre><code>... and strip the <code> automatically.Also, if you use a general rule for <code> with white-space:pre;, you cannot use it for inline snippets without additional classes. If you were to create a class instead, you've won nothing compared to <pre><code>.CSS is for presentation.White space is significant (not presentational) in many programming languages.To represent a block of computer code, the pre element can be used with a code element;To represent a block of computer output the pre element can be used with a samp element.<pre><code> for block code that must not wrap.\nUse <code> for inline code that can wrap.Line breaks and white spaces in the text enclosed within the <pre> tags is maintained as it is in the html document when displays on the browser.Browsers normally render <pre> text in a fixed-pitched font, with whitespace.<pre> shows line breaks!

When the rows are expanded, it will replace the div, with just the content.So here's the html:And here's the jsCheckout this fiddle for an example\nhttps://jsfiddle.net/p9mtqhm7/52/I expanded one of the answers, however my functionality is a bit different. In my version, different rows form different groups. And \"header\" row triggers collapsing/expanding of that particular group. Also, each individual subgroup memorizes state that its in. It might sound a bit confusing, you can test drive my version using jsfiddle. Hope this code snippets will be helpful to someone out there!HTMLCSSJSDEMOI would say using the data- attribute to match the headers with the elements inside it. Fiddle : http://jsfiddle.net/GbRAZ/1/A preview of the HTML alteration :JS code :EDIT:\nBut, it involves some HTML changes. so I dunno if thats what you wanted. A better way to structure this would be using <th> or by changing the entire html to use ul, ol, etc or even a div > span setup.A JavaScript accordion does the trick. This fiddle by W3Schools makes a simple task even more simple using nothing but javascript, which i partially reproduce below.if using php, don't forget to convert \" to '.

Not depending on browser window size, screen resolution, toolbar layout, etc. E.g. I want it to be in the middle of the browser window.To do this you need to know the size of the element you are centering. Any measurement will do (i.e. px, em, percent), but it has to have a fixed size.The css will look as follows:Edit: This centers in the viewport. You can only center in the browser window using JavaScript. But that might be good enough anyway, since you probably want to display a popup/modal box?I surprised that nobody said about position=fixed. It makes exactly what I asked and works in all \"human\" browsers and IE since 7.This is completely possible with just CSS-- no JavaScript needed:\nHere's an exampleHere is the source code behind that example:Here is:And the example:Take a look at the original URL for full info:\nhttp://krustev.net/html_center_content.htmlYou can do whatever you like with this code. The only condition is that any derived work must have a reference to the original author.If you don't know the size of the browser you can simply center in CSS with the following code:HTML code:CSS code:This also helps in any unforeseen changes in the future. This should work with any div or screen size:See more details about flex here. This should work on most of the browsers, see compatibility matrix here.I had a lot of problems with centring and alignment until I found Flexbox as a recommendation in a guide.A Complete Guide to FlexboxI'll post a snippet (that works with Chrome) here for convenience:For more details, please refer to the article.orTo centre align a div you should apply the styleThis is checked and works in all browsers.I don't think you can do that. You can be in the middle of the document, however you don't know the toolbar layout or the size of the browser controls. Thus you can center in the document, but not in the middle of the browser window.If I understand you correct, you want to center the element vertically and horizontally based on the window, not the document.  It can be a bit of a pain, but you can use javascript to detect the window size, scroll position, element size, etc. and then position the element in the center of the window (not the document, but the viewable window).If you want this element to remain in the moddule of the window as you scroll you would need to capture the scroll event and adjust the position.The code for doing this differs from one browser to the next.You could write a JavaScript wto find the window height and width and make it to half to find the centre point.Add you stuff inside a  tag, and set the div top and left from the javascript to the centre coordinates you have found using Javascript.Let me know if you need the code.Hope this helps. Trick is to use absolute positioning and configure the top and left columns. Of course \"dead center\" will depend on the size of the object/div you are embedding, so you will need to do some work. For a login window I used the following - it also has some safety with max-width and max-height that may actually be of use to you in your example.

I am talking about HTML4 Transitional DTD.If not then is it OK to instead use <span style=\"display: block\"> instead?Syntactically, a div inside a p is invalid in all standards of HTML. Moreover, when using a conforming HTML parser, it is impossible to place a <div> element inside a <p> in the DOM because the opening <div> tag will automatically close the <p> element. Semantically, the correct choice depends on the content that you are marking up. You will need to show at least a sample full paragraph and possibly the content surrounding it to be sure of providing sufficient information for the correct semantic mark-up to be determined.However, given that both <div> and <span> are semantics free, and that CSS in no way can ever change that, if you are certain that the contents of the <p> tag truly form a paragraph, and that <span style=\"display: block\"> gets you the presentational effect that you are seeking, then that is valid HTML and would be a wholly appropriate solution. No, a paragraph element may not contain other block elements.ReferenceA paragraph tag is intended for a block of text. If your elements is a part of the text (and not block elements), it would be semantically correct, otherwise not. A span tag with display:block is still a block element.It is syntactically incorrect, as you can see for yourself using the W3C markup validator.Semantically and practically I would say it's \"ok\" in the sense that a) it is very natural, b) all browsers handle it correctly (indeed this is one of the easiest problems they have to face daily).If your HTML is produced by user input (e.g. an HTML editor widget using which visitors can leave comments) then I 'd say simply let it be, even if it is \"incorrect\".Otherwise, you could change the markup a bit. Personally I would go withand give .para appropriate margins with CSS.FWIW:  I had a paragraph bracketed by paragraph tags.  Inside that I put a div with display:inline on the div.   But it still treated the div as a block element and closed the paragraph, creating a new line with a paragraph spacing.    It appears that any block element inside paragraph tags  forces the paragraph to close even if the block element is being displayed as inline in its CSS.  Without any context, it seems fine to me, so long as your outer tag really is still a paragraph. If your div is something like your top nav bar, then not so much, but if it's a container for an image and caption that you're going to float off to the right, then there's no problem.This post shows something about this. Looks like it is the standard browser behavior.http://blog.programmingsolution.net/html/html-div-tag-inside-html-p-paragraph-tag-does-not-work-correctly/"},

Refer to this question:Scrolling an iframe with javascript?I believe you'll only be able to scroll it if both pages are on the same domain.Assuming you are using an iframe to import content available to the public but not owned by you into your website, you can always use the page anchor to direct you iframe to load where you want it to.First you create an iframe with the width and height needed to display the data.Second install addon such as Show Anchors 2 for Firefox and use it to display all the page anchors on the page you would like display in your iframe. Find the anchor point you want your frame to use and copy the anchor location by right clicking on it.(You can download and install the plugin here =>  https://addons.mozilla.org/en-us/firefox/addon/show-anchors-2/)Third use the copied web address with anchor point as your iframe source.

However it doesn't explain anywhere what their version of transparent is actually defined as. I looked through the old CSS1 and CSS2 w3c specs and couldn't find an old definition. What does transparent mean?rgba() is a function that calculates the color and transparency for an item, it is very useful when you want to control the color and the alpha of an item, especially if you do not want to totally transparent. Being a function, you are telling the browser what color and transparency exact you want to draw the item, this is closer to JS than CSS.On the other hand, \"transparent\" is a  CSS property that identifies an item will be completely transparent, without making calculations of color and alpha. Being a CSS property and not a function, each browser applies it in a different way, so it would differ much to the method used by the browser to apply this property.EDIT\nOk, you say that i contradict that in my answer:Well, i dont contradict that. One thing thing is the specification of the W3C standard, and another thing is the implementation of that standard by developers of different browsers. I will not break the code of IE to prove what I'm saying, because it's a bit illegal, directly ask the guys at Microsoft to see their answer.What I've told you is that they are browsers that do not handle transparent and rgba(0, 0, 0, 0) in the same way. That's because the transparent property is much older than the rgba(0, 0, 0, 0) function (you like that more than rgba ()?), And most likely, while for IE have developed an effective method for rgba (r, g, b, a), they are still using the old method with the transparent property.One thing you always have to keep in mind is that no web browser meets the W3C standards to 100%, that is why in most of the new property must be added the specific extension of the manufacturer (moz- webkit-, etc) Think why it is so absurd to write the same thing four times, when everything would be solved using the standard property, and yourself will answer because it is not the same to use transparent and rgba (0, 0, 0, 0) in IE.I've been trying your code for the value transparent in Chrome, installed on a laptop running Windows 7 OS.I'm not getting any wobble whatsoever myself. So I expect this issue is specific for certain browsers and operating systems based on how that specific browser and OS decide to render your element.This issue could be related to whether or not your browser uses hardware acceleration. Now, there is a trick to force your browser to use hardware acceleration : make your browser think that a 3D transformation is being applied to an element.You could to that by adding the following properties to your element :While I'm not entirely sure if this will fix the wobbling issue when using transparent (as I'm not able to reproduce the issue), applying this \"hack\" should in theory always give you the smoothest rendering.  Check out eg. this article for more information.So for your demo code, you'd end up with this :THE FIDDLE :https://jsfiddle.net/z2r7ypy7/4/In my opinion, it is not good to use the same id twice, whatever you are doing, it is meant as an identifier.\nI also do not find it weird that they both show the animation, since both of them have the same id that match the animation in the css. if you do this, only one wobbles, and it makes perfect sense to me.\nPerhaps it does not answer your question about the transparent issue, but I am not sure if that is really the issue anyways.edit\nNo matter which color I try, transparent or rgba(0,0,0,0) in any combination they both animate on Safari."},

In this case, I give up and just add an additional div.Use css...With width auto it will always append to the smallest possible size; and with the reset it will help maintain natural flow.But if the child is bigger in any way than the parent, then it will not be possible. But with this CSS I think you will achieve what you want to the maximum of what is possible.thirtydot's solution is actually a good idea.Here's a clearer example: http://jsfiddle.net/y9dtL68d/HTMLCSSI believe, every front-end developer encountered this situation, at least once. Let's say you need to absolute position something… And then you try to move it in some direction, and boom it disappears… You forgot the parent was set to overflow:hidden and now your element is lost in the hidden infinite vacuum.There is a css trick to do this.Please find the below demo example for it...I did this in a very simple way Here is jsfiddle linkThe Problem has a Name: \"offsetParent\". As soon as an element gets the position abolute|relative or has its position/size altered by a transformation, it becomes the offsetParent of its children. The original offsetParent for all elements (and therefore the area in which overflowing content will be shown or relative to which absolute positions are given) is the viewport of the browser or the iFrame. But after an absolute or relative position had been applied to an element, ist bounding box is the new origin for positioning and clipping of all of ist children.In a Project, I had a 'popup' window containing a pulldown menu. The pulldown could easily extend over the limits of the window. But as soon as the window was moved (by using a transformation or relative positioning), the pulldown appeared at a wrong place (having the top-left Position of the window as additional Offset) and was clipped at the window's borders. The quick hack I used was to append the pulldown as child of Body (instead fo the window) and position it absolute, using the coordinates of the button that opens the menu (from the clientBoundingBox of the button) and the offset from the button's offsetParent) as absolute position of the pulldown. Then the Body again was the limiting area. This is, however, a bit tricky if it comes to multiple Levels of z-axis ordering (as the pulldown's z-axis is relative to Body, which might be different from the one the window has). But since the window has to be visible (therefore on top) to open the menu, this was negligible.\nOf course, this solution requires the use of JavaScript and cannot be done by simple CSS.You can't eat the cake and keep it. If you take something out of the layout context, it becomes ist own, indepenent (and limited) layout 'frame'"},

I hope, it will be useful summary. Thanks everybody for answers.1.  Layers Hack / Null Transform HackIn 'ancient times' (like 2 years ago) somebody discovered that you can draw your CSS animation faster.How does it work?If you add transform: translateZ(0) to a css selector, it will force a browser to move the element with this selector to the new compositor layer. What is more, it will increase performance (in most situations, use powers of GPU instead CPU) read more here. 2. Bye Bye hacks, welcome \"will-change:\"Probably, it's too early to say bye bye to Layer Hack, but this time will come shortly.\nThe new property will change appeared in specs of CSS and will be a great successor of layer hack.3. Browser supportFor now, it's available in Chrome and Opera and partially supported by Firefox as well.4. How to use it properlyThis is probably the most valuable advice that you can get.There is no point to use it straight before an action begins by e.g. adding it to the :hover state of a selector. Because browser will not have required time to prepare optimization before change occurrence. Browser will need approx. 200ms to apply optimization, so for example it is better to add will-change to a element when a parent element is on hover state. MoreExample:You need to use it really sparingly. If you want to optimize everything, the results will be opposite than expected ones. will-change forces browser to keep optimization turned on and reserve resources like memory for changes in the future which may never happen. It is recommended to turn off will-change afterwards, when it is not necessary anymore e.g. when the animation is finished. You can do it easily using JavaScript document.getElementById('my_element_id').style.willChange = off;Now with the help of CSS you can do various of animations, and sometimes this animation becomes a bottleneck for a CPU. So instead of doing this job on a CPU, it would be nice to use GPU for this task. And not so long ago people started to use a trick to do this for a 2D transformation by doing something like:This made a browser think that it is doing a 3D transformation, and because all 3D transformations are using GPU, this will offload CPU. This looks hacky (because in fact it is) and will-change property is going to change this by informing the browser to look out for changes in the future, and optimize and allocate memory accordingly.Based on W3C draft, Good idea to use will-change is to let the browser know in advance what changes on an element can be expected. This allows the browser to make the proper optimizations in advance, which leads to quicker rendering.This information was taken from this excellent explanation about will-change property. The article has additional example when it is nice to use it and when it is useless or even detrimentalAs far as I know...So example usage would be applying that at some point of scroll, with scrollTop:400, then gradually animate opacity and at lets say scrollTop:500, disable will-change again.Source: shoptalkshow podcast - they mention this article - https://dev.opera.com/articles/css-will-change-property/ - which is probably better source of info than my post :DThe best solution for me:But, this solution has trouble with calc in ios safari in a fixed position can cause high battery consumption"},

However, changing \"display: none;\" to something like: ... did the trick for me. Perhaps Firefox won't load hidden images, or maybe it's related to rendering(?).If they are the same dimensions, one possibility is to draw the two images directly on top of each other, with the CSS :hover class for the top image having display: none;This way both images will be preloaded, but hovering will make the second visible.You can preload images The \"double up the original background image\" trick didn't work for me so I used another css trick:This technique works nicely for me and ensures not only is the hover image pre-loaded, but it's also ready and waiting to be displayed. (Most other solutions rely on switching the background image on hover, which just seems to take the browser a bit of time to figure out, however much the image is pre-loaded.)Create :before and :after pseudo elements on the container with the two images, but hide the one you want to see on hover. Then, on hover, switch the visibility.So long as they both share the same size and positioning rules, you should see a neat swap.Just change the size of the background image, instead of the source of it! So...The best way to do this is to just insert the images onto the webpage and set display to none."},

Check the browser compatibility chart over here on caniuse.comI have added the cubic-bezier(.2,.6,.8,.4) which is explained in @ChrisSpittles answer. It provides a neat effect!Here are four different versions to supplement @misterManSam's brilliant answer.ExplanationIf you filled up a circular bowl full of liquid, it would fill faster at the bottom and top than it would in the middle (because there is more area to cover in the wider middle section). So, with that crude explanation in mind, the animation needs to: start fast, slow in the middle, and then finish fast when the bowl narrows again at the top.To do this we can use a CSS3 easing function: cubic-bezier(.2,.6,.8,.4).Have a look at the example below.(If you want to tweak the easing here is a great resource: http://cubic-bezier.com/#.2,.6,.8,.4)Example:Let's take this one step further?

I created a wavy SVG image in Adobe Illustrator and then animated that to travel from left to right on a loop with a separate CSS animation and voila:ExampleThis example includes a pour line (most bowls fill from the top, not the bottom). The pour line first animates from top to bottom while an animation-delay property prevents the fill animation from happening until the pour has finished.This example adds a few more properties to the CSS to make it look a little more realistic.I think this accomplishes your first goal:Here the working working codpen of Water filling in a div on HoverHTMLCSShttps://codepen.io/ajitkumar96/pen/pOYbQm?editors=1100"},

I have tried below ones, but still sometimes it shows the default blue color (say after clicking and removing the mouse etc). How can I change the entire theme altogether?The easiest way to see which properties you need to override is to take a look at Bootstrap's source code, specifically the .button-variant mixin defined in mixins/buttons.less. You still need to override quite a lot of properties to get rid of all of the .btn-primary styling (e.g. :focus, disabled, usage in dropdowns etc).A better way might be to:If you want to override any default properties in bootstrap you have to make the properties as important.i hope this will works for you.I guess you forgot .btn-primary:focus property and comma after .btn-primaryYou also can use less and redefine some colors in variables.less fileWith this in mind your code will be look like this:2019 Update for Bootstrap 4Now that Bootstrap 4 uses SASS, you can easily change the primary button color using the button-variant mixins:https://www.codeply.com/go/2bHYxYSC0n (SASS demo)This SASS compiles into the following CSS...https://www.codeply.com/go/lD3tUE01lo (CSS demo)To change the primary color for all classes see: Customizing Bootstrap CSS template and How to change the bootstrap primary color?Just create your own button on:CheersYou have missed one style \".btn-primary:active:focus\" which causes that still during btn click default bootstrap color show up for a second.\nThis works in my code:Remove the button color class like \"btn-success\" and put a custom class like \"btn-custom\" and write css for that class. That simply works for me.Here's my flavor without the loss of hover. I personally like it better than the standard bootstrap transitioning.I had run into the similar problem recently, and managed to fix it with adding classesAlso pay attention to [disabled] and [disabled]:hover, if this class is used on input[type=submit]. Like this:The simplest way is to:1) intercept every button state2) add !important to override the statesThe more practical UI way is to make the hover state of the button darker than the original state:I think using !important is not a very wise option. It may cause for many other issues specially when making the site responsive. So, my understanding is that, the best way to do this to use custom button CSS class with .btn bootstrap class. .btn is the base style class for bootstrap button. So, keep that as the layout, we can change other styles using our custom css class. \nOne more extra thing I want to mention here. Some people are trying to remove blue outline from the buttons. It's not a good idea because that accessibility issue when using keyboard. Change it's color using outline-color: instead."},

It has higher precedence than the style in your external CSS file.However, if you want it to change some actions later on, you can use a bit of JavaScript.You can not override inline CSS having !important, because it has higher precedence, but, using JavaScript, you can achieve what you want.You cannot override inline style having !important. First preference is inline style.For eg: we have a class and in jsp here doesn't take the padding-left:4px; .It takes class styleT except the padding-left:4px;.\nThere will be padding-left:0px;. Here is a simple jQuery solution.You can see this example! There are several rules for CSS selector. The strongest selector is inline (if same level with/without !important). Next ones: id, class, etc. So if a tag is already stylized by inline css with !important, you just have a way: use Javascript to change. As you see, the style by inline css was removed and the id is the strongest selector now !Precedence rules when two CSS properties apply to the same node:So you see the inline !important is the highest precedence."},

I tried using something like width: 100%; height: 100% but that had no effect. How do I stretch the anchor tag correctly?The \"a\" tag is an inline level element.  No inline level element may have its width set.  Why?  Because inline level elements are meant to represent flowing text which could in theory wrap from one line to the next.  In those sorts of cases, it doesn't make sense to supply the width of the element, because you don't necessarily know if it's going to wrap or not.  In order to set its width, you must change its display property to block, or inline-block:If memory serves, you can set the width on certain inline level elements in IE6, though.  But that's because IE6 implements CSS incorrectly and wants to confuse you.Just style the A with a display:block;:is the HTML5 way.

Out of topic, notice how flawless angular-material displays the ripple effect, even on a \"large surface\".UPDATE 2018AngularJS Material throws a (gentle) warning when using flex on button elements, so don't assume all HTML elements/tags can handle display:flex properly, or have a homogeneous behaviour across browsers.Remember to consult flexbugs in case of unexpected behaviour in a particular browser.A different approach: This is helpful if the link's container also has images and such inside of it, or is of potentially different sizes depending on image / content size. With this, the anchor tag itself can be empty, and you can arrange other elements inside of anchor's container however you want. Anchor will always match the size of the parent, and will be on top, to make the entire li clickable.I used this code to fill the width and height 100%HTMLCSSJust changing the display property to block didn't work for me.\nI removed the padding of li and set the same padding for a.You should try to avoid using a class on every  tag so your content remains easy to maintain.Use line-height and text-indent instead of padding for li element, and use display: block; for anchor tagI wanted this functionality only on tab view i.e below 720px, so in media query I made:If your <li>s had to have a specific height then your <a>s would only stretch to the <li>'s width and not the height anymore.\nOne way I solve this is to use CSS display:block and add paddings to my <a>s\nOR\nwrap the <a>s around the <li>s"},

What is the benefit gained from using the class name of a H1 without properly using the H1 tag? I would think that you always want to make sure your HTML mirrors your visual importance.Any thoughts explaining a good reason for using .h1 instead of using a h1 tag would be appreciated.You ask:The goal is to use both, together.The usefulness of the .h* classes comes into play when the size of the typography in the design does not correlate with the semantically appropriate heading levels. By splitting the problem in two, we can cleanly solve for both.The first bit is the element/tag. The '<h*>' takes care of semantics, accessibility and SEO.The second bit is the class. The '.h*' takes care of visual semantics and typographical hierarchy. I believe that the origins of these classes come from OOCSS project:Object-Oriented CSSThe latest iteration of OOCSS has changed a little since I last looked at it, but here's the relevant heading.css file, from an older commit, that has the .h1 - .h6 classes that I'm familiar with:6e481bc18f oocss / core / heading / heading.cssFrom the comments:Note the emphasis above.For a good explanation as to why one would use these classes, see:Relevant quotes from the above links:Here's a pseudo-html5 usage example (h/t Jamund Ferguson):Please read full articles (and thread), via links above, for more detailed information related to this question/topic.Most stylesheets have a set of font-sizes that correspond with heading styles 1 through 6. Sometimes, elsewhere on the page, web designers want to use those same font sizes on text which should not be a part of an actual heading element, for semantic reasons. Rather than providing names for each of those sizes like .size-12, .size-14, .size-16, etc, it's easier just to name them all with class names similar to your headings. That way, you know that the text will be the same size as an H1 element, even though it's not actually an H1 element. I've done this a few times myself.A few reasons I can think of:This allows for a separations of visual hierarchy form semantic hierarchy. eg, I want to tell the viewer one thing, while telling a computer (search engines) something else.See:The only thing I can think of offhand is for search engines.  Many will look at an actual h1 tag as the title or subject of a page and use that for searches, etc.  Having multiple h1 tags can confuse the search engine spiders and may screw up searches that would return results for your site (I've also heard it may get you on the \"bad site\" list with some spiders like Google).Having the styles allows you to have the same visual look to an element without screwing up search engines.Another reason I have come across recently... this is not particular to Angular but it serves as a good example:I want to create dynamic/declarative forms in Angular (see Dynamic Forms in the Angular Cookbook) and allow styled text elements. Maximum flexibility would call for allowing me to declaratively add arbitrary HTML elements to my forms, but this is open to scripting attacks, and requires explicit subversion of the Angular compiler to even allow it. Instead, I allow text elements to be added to forms, along with a class for controlling style. So I can use the .h1 style but not the h1 element.This would definitely help in-terms of SEO and google crawlers to understand your page better.\nWhen it reads h1, it assumes that whatever is in there must be the focal point of the page. H2, would be the second components and so on. This way Google can understand the \"scope\" of what your page is covering in-terms of content.Not entirely sure, but a big variable in my opinion would be the \"read\" mode of pages. This would allow devices and readers to organize content especially for devices used by visually impaired people.Also it provides structure to the page and a sense of order."},

After hours of tests it turns out that this rule is what making ALL of my css to be flagged as render-blocking resources at PageSpeed insights. I found the same issue has been discussed before.I don't know why body{background-image: url(...) do this for all the css files!, although I have different images resources in the file for the buttons, icons, ...etc . I fixed this by moving this rule from the .css file and put it in the inline styles. Unfortunately, you will have to break your css plan and put the rule in all of your layouts HTML files instead of being in 1 css file that is imported in all of your HTML layouts, but the 90s and green color in PageSpeed insights deserve it.Fixed mine by introducing placing all css files at the bottom of the page, after the body tag. but this introduces a new problem, the page loads un-styled html for noticeable mili seconds before applying the style. For this I fixed by introducing a splash screen all styled on the page. "},

I believe :first-child is supported, as it's defined in the CSS2.1 specification.One possible solution is to simply give the last child a class name and style that class.Another would be to use JavaScript. jQuery makes this particularly easy as it provides a :last-child pseudo-class which should work in IE8. Unfortunately, that could result in a flash of unstyled content while the DOM loads.If you want to carry on using CSS3 selectors but need to support older browsers I would suggest using a polyfill such as Selectivizr.js"},

Or i am wrong about the whole stuff ?is it possible to use it like Zoom is not included in the CSS specification, but it is supported in IE, Safari 4, Chrome (and you can get a somewhat similar effect in Firefox with -moz-transform: scale(x) since 3.5). See here.So, all browserswill zoom your object in by 2, so it's like doubling the size. Which means if you have On hover, the <a> tag will zoom by 200%.Like I say, in FireFox 3.5+ use -moz-transform: scale(x), it does much the same thing.Edit: In response to the comment from thirtydot, I will say that scale() is not a complete replacement. It does not expand in line like zoom does, rather it will expand out of the box and over content, not forcing other content out of the way. See this in action here. Furthermore, it seems that zoom is not supported in Opera.This post gives a useful insight into ways to work around incompatibilities with scale and workarounds for it using jQuery.Surprised that nobody mentioned that zoom: 1; is useful for IE6-7, to solve most IE-only bugs by triggering hasLayout.This property controls the magnification level for the current element. The rendering effect for the element is that of a “zoom” function on a camera. Even though this property is not inherited, it still affects the rendering of child elements.Examplezoom is a css3 spec for the @viewport descriptor, as described here http://dev.w3.org/csswg/css-device-adapt/#zoom-descused to zoom the entire viewport ('screen'). \nit also happens to zoom individuals elements in a lot of browsers, but not all. \ncss3 specifies transform:scale should be used to achieve such an effect:http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-transforms/#transform-functionsbut it works a little different than the 'element zoom' in those browsers that support it.Only IE and WebKit support zoom, and yes, in theory it does exactly what you're saying.Try it out on an image to see it's full effect :)CSS zoom property is widely supported now > 86% of total browser population.See: http://caniuse.com/#search=zoomAs Joshua M pointed out, the zoom function isn't supported only in Firefox, but you can simply fix this as shown:"},

Using mouse coordinates to determine the location of the selection caret myself? Scary!!I'll look into doing so tomorrow -- unless myself, or somebody else here reading this, can find a sane solution :)I've done a ridiculous amount of fiddling. So, so much jsFiddling.This is not a robust, or complete solution; I may never quite come up with one. If anyone has any better solutions, I'm all ears -- I didn't want to have to do it this way, but it's the only way I've been able to uncover so far. The following jsFiddle, and the information I am about to vomit up, worked for me in this particular instance with my particular versions of Firefox and Chrome on my particular WAMP setup and computer. Don't come crying to me when it doesn't work on your website. This drag-and-drop crap is clearly every man for himself.jsFiddle: Chase Moskal's Dragon DropSo, I was boring my girlfriend's brains out, and she thought I kept saying \"dragon drop\" when really, I was just saying \"drag-and-drop\". It stuck, so that's what I call my little JavaScript buddy I've created for handling these drag-and-drop situations.Turns out -- it's a bit of a nightmare. The HTML5 Drag-and-Drop API even at first glance, is horrible. Then, you almost warm up to it, as you start to understand and accept the way it's supposed to work.. Then you realize what a terrifying nightmare it actually is, as you learn how Firefox and Chrome go about this specification in their own special way, and seem to completely ignore all of your needs. You find yourself asking questions like: \"Wait, what element is even being dragged right now? How to do I get that information? How do I cancel this drag operation? How can I stop this particular browser's unique default handling of this situation?\"... The answers to your questions: \"You're on your own, LOSER! Keep hacking things in, until something works!\".So, here's how I accomplished Precise Drag and Drop of Arbitrary HTML Elements within, around, and between multiple contenteditable's. (note: I'm not going fully in-depth with every detail, you'll have to look at the jsFiddle for that -- I'm just rambling off seemingly relevant details that I remember from the experience, as I have limited time)To the draggables (fancyboxes), I bind a handler for dragstart. We set the dataTransfer to copy a blank string of HTML ' ' -- because we need to trick it into thinking we are going to drag HTML, but we are cancelling out any default behavior. Sometimes default behavior slips in somehow, and it results in a duplicate (as we do the insertion ourselves), so now the worst glitch is a ' ' (space) being inserted when a drag fails. We couldn't rely on the default behavior, as it would fail to often, so I found this to be the most versatile solution.To the dropzones, I bind a handler for dragleave and drop. The dragleave handler exists only for Firefox, as in Firefox, the drag-drop would work (Chrome denies you by default) when you tried to drag it outside the contenteditable, so it performs a quick check against the Firefox-only relatedTarget. Huff.Chrome and Firefox have different ways of acquiring the Range object, so effort had to be put in to do it differently for each browser in the drop event. Chrome builds a range based on mouse-coordinates (yup that's right), but Firefox provides it in the event data. document.execCommand('insertHTML',false,blah) turns out to be how we handle the drop. OH, I forgot to mention -- we can't use dataTransfer.getData() on Chrome to get our dragstart set HTML -- it appears to be some kind of weird bug in the specification. Firefox calls the spec out on it's bullcrap and gives us the data anyways -- but Chrome doesn't, so we bend over backwards and to set the content to a global, and go through hell to kill all the default behavior...Okay, I'm sick of this. I've wrote all I want to about this. I'm calling it a day, and might update this if I think of anything important.Thanks everybody. //Chase.Since I wanted to see this in a native JS solution I worked a bit to remove all jQuery dependencies.

It may be difficult to see until you get many running at the same time or the more they do. CSS animations are limited though. In most cases they really only work off the :hover event. With JavaScript you can perform animations at any event: click, mouseover, mousemove, mouseout, keyup, keydown, etc.In my opinion, jQuery is the best for JavaScript animations in 2010. See jQuery DemosTo add to Uphelix's (correct) answer: JavaScript is an interpreted language and the JS engine of the browser has to parse and execute every instruction during run-time (I know there exist JS compilers, like V8 (used in Chrome), but the principle remains the same).On the other hand, browsers can implement CSS transitions natively, e.g. in C/C++ or something. This code will be compiled to machine language.If CSS transitions are hardware accelerated or not, depends on the techniques the browser uses, the platform the browser runs on, etc.You will notice the difference on mobile browsers (iPhone, Android, etc.).CSS animations have the advantage of being processed by the browser. Fast computations and optimizations are available. In my opinion web animations performance should be looked trough a \"holistic\" point of view. After all an animation, in terms of FPS, can not be faster then the browser refresh.The real performance level is given by the overall UI performance. A JS and a CSS animation can look similar. However CSS animations win since they do not block the UI thread.Stoyan Stefanov wrote and demo how CSS animations are put out of the UI thread:\nhttp://www.phpied.com/css-animations-off-the-ui-thread/"},

Back when this answer was written, IE 9 was still new (about 8 months old) and many developers including myself needed a solution for <= IE 9.  IE 9 is when IE started supporting background-origin.  However, it's been over six and a half years, so here's the updated solution which I highly recommend over using an actual border. In case < IE 9 support is needed.  My original answer can be found below the demo snippet.  It uses an opaque border to simulate padding for background images.you can fake it with a 10px border of the same color as the background:http://jsbin.com/eparad/edit#javascript,html,livethis is actually pretty easily done. You're almost there, doing what you've done with background-position: right center;. What is actually needed in this case is something very much like that. Let's convert these to percentages. We know that center=50%, so that's easy enough. Now, in order to get the padding you wanted, you need to position the background like so: background-position: 99% 50%. The second, and more effective way of going about this, is to use the same background-position idea, and just use background-position: 400px (width of parent) 50%;. Of course, this method requires a static width, but will give you the same thing every time.Method 1 (99% 50%)\nMethod 2 (400px 50%)There is actually a native solution to this, using the four-values to background-position.CssClass {background-position: right 10px top 20px;}This means 10px from right and 20px from top.\nyou can also use three values the fourth value will be count as 0.you can use background-origin:padding-box; and then add some padding where you want, for example: #logo {background-image: url(your/image.jpg); background-origin:padding-box; padding-left: 15%;}\nThis way you attach the image to the div padding box that contains it so you can position it wherever you want. In case anyone else needs to add padding to something with background-image and background-size: contain or cover, I used the following which is a nice way of doing it. You can replace the border-width with 10% or 2vw or whatever you like.This means you don't have to define a width.first off, to be a bit of a henpeck, its best NOT to use just the <background> tag.  rather, use the proper, more specific, <background-image> tag.the only way that i'm aware of to do such a thing is to build the padding into the image by extending the matte.  since the empty pixels aren't stripped, you have your padding right there.  so if you need a 10px border, create 10px of empty pixels all around your image.  this is mui simple in Photoshop, Fireworks, GIMP, &c.i'd also recommend trying out the PNG8 format instead of the dying GIF...  much better.there may be an alternate solution to your problem if we knew a bit more of how you're using it.  :)  it LOOKS like you're trying to add an accordion button.  this would be best placed in the HTML because then you can target it with JavaScript/PHP; something you cannot do if it's in the background (at least not simply).  in such a case, you can style the heck out of the image you currently have in CSS by using the following:WR!To add space before background image, one could define the 'width' of element which is using 'background-image' object. And then to define a pixel value in 'background-position' property to create space from left side.For example, I'd a scenario where I got a navigation menu which had a bullet before link item and the bullet graphic were changeable if corrosponding link turns into an active state. Further, the active link also had a background-color to show, and this background-color had approximate 15px padding both on left and right side of link item (so on left, it includes bullet icon of link too).While padding-right fulfill the purpose to have background-color stretched upto 15px more on right of link text. The padding-left only added to space between link text and bullet.So I took the width of background-color object from PSD design (for ex. 82px) and added that to li element (in a class created to show active state) and then I set background-position value to 20px. Which resulted in bullet icon shifted inside from the left edge. And its provided me desired output of having left padding before bullet icon used as background image.Please note, you may need to adjust your padding / margin values accordingly, which may used either for space between link items or for spacing between bullet icon and link text.

Well because this line:It's only importing your css as string, when in reality what you want is your vendor css in a style tag. If you check config/webpack.commons.js you will find this rule:This rule allows your components to import the css files, basically this:In the AppComponent there's no encapsulation, because of this line encapsulation: ViewEncapsulation.None, which means any css rules will be applied globally to your app. So you can import the bootstrap styles in your app component:But if you insist in importing to your vendor.ts then you will need to install a new loader, npm i style-loader --save-dev this will allow webpack to inject css to your page. Then you need to create a specific rule, on your webpack.common.js and change the existing one:The firs rule will be only applied when you try to import css, from any package inside node_modules the second rule will be applied to any css that you import from outside the node_modulesIt is possible by using @import '~bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.css'; on the styles.css file. (Note the ~)Edit: How it works - The '~' is an alias set on the webpack config pointing to the assets folder... simple as that..Edit 2: Example on how to configure webpack with the '~' alias...\nthis should go on the webpack config file (usually webpack.config.js)...So here is a way to import various CSS files using the angular-cli which I find the most convenient.Basically, you can refer to the CSS files (order is important if you will be overriding them) in the config and angular-cli will take care of the rest.

I read other people had the same issue.Could anyone please help me fixing this?EDIT: declaring @font-face directly in the CSS does not work either.To convert HTML to PDF by wkhtmltopdf try to avoid woff font face. Use the truetype format of the Google Web Fonts with base64 encode.Recently I tried to use a Google web font from Google Web Fonts. In the browser it shows correctly but it doesn't show after converting HTML to PDF.After searching the web extensively, at last, I found tools to encode fonts to the base64 format and also got CSS for @font-face.Read the solution here.A simple solution: Base64-encode your font and embed it in the CSS:FontSquirrel can do this for you through the advanced options of their Webfont Generator; Google and other fonts can be encoded with this tool.I've used this solution with pdfkit and wicked_pdf, which work through wkhtmltopdf, so I presume this should work with the native wkhtmltopdf as well.I had this same problem and solved it by downloading the fonts and running it off of a local file in my web server with this font-face declaration:I was able to find this font on Font Squirrel, but your mileage may vary.I think what happens with the fonts off of Google is that it's trying to load only the format that it thinks this browser wants, which for WebKit is woff (I believe). But wkhtmltopdf can't embed a woff font in a PDF, and so defaults back to sans-serif. By declaring all of them, the TrueType font is included, which is what the PDF actually uses.Also, you need to define the font you want used as the first one in any font-family CSS definition or wkhtmltopdf will just ignore it.I've just tested that using the @importnotation works:I'm using django-wkhtmltopdf version 2.0.3I must have tried a gazillion variations to get this work (from local). I am trying to get Open Sans Condensed embedded into a pdf via WKHtmlToPdf.I think it is important that you download and install the Open Sans Condensed ttf directly from google and install it. It is also important to reboot to allow other services access after install. I downloaded the ttf from font-squirrel originally and condensed was listed as \"Open Sans\" in windows/fonts, which is wrong, if you look after the google install it is listed as \"Open Sans Condensed Light\" so even google's local('Open Sans Cond Light') script is wrong. As mentioned before you need to be explicit with the stretch and weights, so this is what has worked for me:I've been struggling with this for about two days now, my advice to you if none of the answers above work for you:Install the font (ttf) in the machine that hosts the webserver and just require it in the css just like you would do with a common font.Now wkhtmltopdf should be able to include the fontIn my case I just had to add this optionand Google Font text started to show up.[wkhtmltopdf 0.12.4 (with patched qt)]Make sure you're not declaring what font you are printing with in your print stylesheet.The following works for me.

I will still run into padding/spacing issues between the two OS's.What should I categorize this issue under? Line-height? Table-cells? OS? etc...Thanks in advance!If it is resolved by using a different font (Arial) then the issue is with the font, not with the CSS. As you have noticed font rendering differs between browsers.One possible solution could be to download the Cutive font (I see it has a SIL license) and then run it through the Font Squirrel font-face generator. In \"Expert\" mode there is an option to \"Fix Vertical Metrics\" which might be what you are looking for.I came across this problem with a custom font that had been created for a client's brand. I opened the TTF font in Font Forge. The way I created uniformity with rendering was to adjust the values in Element->Font Info->OS/2->Metrics. Win Ascent/Descent values appear to work differently to the other values. I had the following values:Win Ascent: 1000Win Descent: 0Typo Ascent: 750Typo Descent: -250HHead Ascent: 750HHead Descent: -250I changed the Win Ascent and Descent values to:Win Ascent: 750Win Descent: 250 (notice the positive value)It appears you need to match the values except in my case I needed to invert the value of Win Descent to a positive one. I have very limited knowledge about fonts but this did fix my problem. I generated the font as TTF and then ran it through a web font generator. The fonts now render identically on Mac/Windows 7/Android/iOS. Hope this helps someone. My solution to this (very annoying problem):Enjoy a victory over cross-browser/platform css ridiculousness.I also came across this issue. Luke's answer helped me. I had to adjust the fonts with FontForge using this settings:Uncheck all \"Is offset\" checkboxes and also the \"Really use Typo metrics\" checkbox. I had most problems with Firefox and IE. Playing around with the value of \"Win Descent\" fixed it for those two browsers.Part of the problem may be in the way Windows/Mac OSX renders fonts. Specifically those that are brought in via @font-face. Have you tried switching out which font formats are being used?I witnessed the same issue, with a custom font (Trade Gothic) served by FastFonts.Windows did what it should have.  But all other browsers on Linux based machines, Mac, iOS, Android suffered the problem.My only solution was to match on the user agent, and namespace the body tag with .not-winThen my styles could override the line-height specific to non-windows devices.Since you said in your comment to Jordan Brown that using Arial makes the alignment perfect, this is a font issue. It is likely that whoever created your font did not set the Ascent value properly.If you have the TTF, upload it to FontSquirrel, select the \"Expert\" option and then keeping all default options. The one that fixes it I believe is \"Fix Vertical Metrics.\" but I had issues when changing the defaults so I recommend keeping them as-is.Now the font line height renders the same on MAC and PC (it worked for me).For those who can't use Font Squirrel, I can confirm that this problem could be fixed in Font Forge for the font I was working with. Based on the answer provided by Luke, here are the steps I followed (no new information here, just providing easy-to-follow instructions):1) Install FontForge (free)\nDownload from:\nhttps://fontforge.github.io/ 2) Open the problematic font in FontForge3) Choose Element > Font Info\n4) On the left panel, click OS/2, then click the Metrics tab5) Change Win Ascent to the same number as HHead Ascent, and Win Descent to the POSITIVE value of HHead Descent (i.e., remove minus sign), then click OK. (If those numbers don't address the problem, try adjusting them until you find numbers that fix the issue for your specific font.) \n6) Click File > Generate Fonts. Choose the font type for your font. If the font is an .otf font, choose OpenType (CFF). Uncheck \"Validate Before Saving\". Set a name for your new font file. Click Generate.\nThanks to everyone who contributed answers to this question!It's caused by font format history and Windows/Mac wars, there are different ways to compute line height and if they are not synced in the font you use things will go wrong on some systemsYou need to fix your font (if the licensing allows it) or switch to one without this problemSee http://www.webfonts.info/node/330 (warning, this is an infomercial even if the tech info is true)Better, not to make your design depend on an exact value hereThe Mac correctly displays the lengths below the baseline as belonging to line height. It seems that OS X counts bottom up whereas Windows calculates from the Top.Since 1em is the width of the capital M of the used font it is usually smaller than the font's overall height.Have you tried setting the line-height to be the same as the element height? This usually helps solve these kind of problems."},

CSS/CSS3 'target-new' property etc, not supported by any major browsers, 2017 August, though it is part of the W3 spec since 2004 February.W3Schools 'modal' construction, uses ':target' pseudo-class that could contain WP navigation. You can also add HTML rel=\"noreferrer and noopener beside target=\"_blank\" to improve 'new tab' performance. CSS will not open links in tabs for now, but this page explains how to do that with jQuery (compatibility may depend for WP coders).\nMDN has a good review at Using the :target pseudo-class in selectorsAnother way to use target=\"_blank\" is:Example:While waiting for the adoption of CSS3 targeting by the major browsers, one could run the following sed command once the (X)HTML has been created:It will add target=\"_blank\" to all external hyperlinks. Variations are also possible.EDITI use this at the end of the makefile which generates every web page on my site.This is actually javascript but related/relevant because .querySelectorAll targets by CSS syntax:this example uses css to target links in a menu with id = \"example\"that creates a variable which is a collection of the elements we want to change, but we still have actually change them by setting the new target (\"_blank\"):That code assumes that there are 5 or less elements.

You can now fully inherit (explicit named) classes.\nSo no need to copy properties as in Hieu Nguyen's and Nick P's CSS answers. LESS will do it all with:The https://github.com/jharding/typeahead.js-bootstrap.css/blob/master/typeahead.js-bootstrap.less less code is broken for BS 3.

You may need to play with top and left numbers to get it right.Based in Andreas's answer I'd bet for the following using less:The solution that I came up with, was to simply add another CSS class (from-group-lg) to my form-group element.My HTML:In my scss file I added:From Typeahead problems with Bootstrap 3.0 RC1: \nAs mentioned by [laurent-wartel][2] try https://github.com/hyspace/typeahead.js-bootstrap3.less or https://github.com/bassjobsen/Bootstrap-3-Typeahead for additional CSS to use typeahead.js with Bootstrap 3.1.0.Or use use the \"old\" (TB 2) plugin with the new Bloodhound suggestion engine: https://github.com/bassjobsen/Bootstrap-3-Typeahead/issues/26A cleaner Less solutionWhere the markup looks something like:Another approach to make Twitter Typeahead to work with Bootstrap 3.Then, in your LESS stylesheet, you can add the following:No need to go thru any of these complicated implementations, just add To the parent element.

Alternatively, wrap the table in a div and use the div's padding.Here's the thing you should understand about tables... They're not a tree of nested independent elements. They're a single compound element. While the individual TDs behave more or less like CSS block elements, the intermediate stuff (anything between the TABLE and TD, including TRs and TBODYs) is indivisible and doesn't fall into either inline nor block. No random HTML elements are allowed in that other-dimensional space, and the size of such other-dimensional space isn't configurable at all through CSS. Only the HTML cellspacing property can even get at it, and that property has no analog in CSS.So, to solve your problem, I'd suggest either a DIV wrapper as another poster suggests, or if you absolutely must keep it contained in the table, you have this ugly junk:You can't... Maybe if you posted a picture of the desired effect there's another way to achieve it.For example, you can wrap the entire table in a DIV and set the padding to the div.Funny, I was doing precisely this yesterday.  You just need this in your css filethen wrap the table in a suitable divThere is another trick :(Just saw it at my current job)With css, a table can have padding independently of its cells.The padding property is not inherited by its children.So, defining:Should work. You could also specifically tell the browser how to pad (or in this case, not pad) your cells.EDIT: Not supported by IE8. Sorry.You can try the border-spacing property. That should do what you want. But you may want to see this answer.CSS doesn't really allow you to do this on a table level. Generally, I specify cellspacing=\"3\" when I want to achieve this effect. Obviously not a css solution, so take it for what it's worth.Works in Firefox, Chrome, IE11, Edge. "},

Each line box starts with a strut which is an imaginary inline box the height of the line-height specified for the block. The line box then continues with the inline boxes of the markup, according to their line heights.The diagram below shows the layout for your first example. Note that because 1.7 times the font-height is much less than the height of the strut, the line height is determined by the height of the strut, since the line box must wholly contain its inline boxes. If you had set the line height on the span to be greater than 200px, the line boxes would be taller, and you would see the text move further apart.When you make the span inline-block, the relationship between the div and the span doesn't change, but the span gains it's own block layout structure with its own stack of line boxes. So the the text and the line breaks are laid out within this inner stack. The strut of the inner block is 1.7 times the font-height, i.e., the same as the text, and the layout now looks as below, so the text lines are positioned closer together, reflecting the line-height setting of the span. (Note that the two diagrams are on different scales.)This is by design.  There are two element types within an HTML document: block and inline.  Inline elements don't interrupt the flow of the document, but block elements do.Block elements, as the name suggests, block out an area on the page which contains some content.  Some examples of block elements are: <p> and <div>.  You can apply height, line-height and other CSS properties to these elements in order to change the size of the block, and subsequently, the flow of the document.Inline elements take up the minimum amount of space required to render them, which means setting widths and heights on these elements will have no effect.  As you've already seen, you can tell the browser to treat an inline element as a block element to allow you to apply heights to them.An example of this can be seen when using <li> elements to create menus.  <li>s are block elements.  If you create a list, the items will display vertically on the page, ensuring that each list item appears below the previous one.  However, if you apply display: inline; to the list items, they will now appear horizontally."},

However, they can only have an effect when there's free space in the cross axis of the flex line.The align-content property works only in multi-line containers. It is ignored in single-line containers.The flexbox specification provides four keyword properties for aligning flex items:To understand the functions of these properties it's important to first understand the structure of a flex container.The X and Y AxesA flex container works in two directions: x-axis (horizontal) and y-axis (vertical).                                                                                                                Source: WikipediaThe child elements of a flex container – known as \"flex items\" – can be aligned in either direction.This is flex alignment at its most fundamental level.The Main and Cross AxesOverlaying the x and y axes are, in flex layout, the main and cross axes.By default, the main axis is horizontal (x-axis), and the cross axis is vertical (y-axis). That's the initial setting, as defined by the flexbox specification.                                                                                                                Source: W3CHowever, unlike the x and y axes, which are fixed, the main and cross axes can switch directions.The flex-direction PropertyIn the image above, the main axis is horizontal and the cross axis is vertical. As mentioned earlier, that's an initial setting of a flex container.However, these directions can be easily switched with the flex-direction property. This property controls the direction of the main axis; it determines whether flex items align vertically or horizontally.From the spec:There are four values for the flex-direction property:The cross axis is always perpendicular to the main axis.Within the container, flex items exist in a line, known as a \"flex line\".A flex line is a row or column, depending on flex-direction.A container can have one or more lines, depending on flex-wrap. Single-Line Flex Containerflex-wrap: nowrap establishes a single-line flex container, in which flex items are forced to stay in a single line (even if they overflow the container).The image above has one flex line.Multi-Line Flex Containerflex-wrap: wrap or wrap-reverse establishes a multi-line flex container, in which flex items can create new lines.The image above has three flex lines.The image above has three flex lines.Properties are Assigned to the Main and Cross (not X and Y) AxesWhile the flex-direction property controls the direction in which flex items are laid out, there are four properties that control alignment and positioning. These are:Each one of these properties is permanently assigned to an axis.The justify-content property works only in the main axis.The three align-* properties work only in the cross axis.It's a common mistake to assume that these properties are fixed to the x and y axes. For example, justify-content is always horizontal, and align-items is always vertical.However, when flex-direction is switched to column, the main axis becomes the y-axis, and justify-content works vertically.The focus of this post is cross-axis alignment. For an explanation of main-axis alignment and the justify-content property, see this post:DefinitionsThe flexbox specification provides three keyword properties for cross-axis alignment:The align-items property aligns flex items along the cross axis of the flex line. It applies to flex containers.The align-self property is used to override align-items on individual flex items. It applies to flex items.Here's the definition from the spec:There are six possible values for align-items / align-self:(For a description of each value, click on the spec definition heading above.)The initial value of align-items is stretch, meaning flex items will expand the full available length of the container's cross axis.The initial value of align-self is auto, meaning it inherits the value of align-items. Below is an illustration of the effect of each value in a row-direction container.                                                                                                                source: W3CThis property is slightly more complex than align-items and align-self. Here's the definition from the spec:In contrast to align-items and align-self, which move flex items within their line, align-content moves flex lines within the container.There are the six possible values for align-content:(For a description of each value, click on the spec definition heading above.)Below is an illustration of the effect of each value in a row-direction container.                                                                                                                source: W3CWhy does align-content work only in multi-line flex containers?In a single-line flex container, the cross size of the line is equal to the cross size of the container. This means there is no free space between the line and the container. As a result, align-content can have no effect.Here's the relevant section from the spec:In Example #1, align-self works with flex-wrap: nowrap because the flex items exist in a single-line container. Therefore, there is one flex line and it matches the height of the container.In Example #2, align-self fails because it exists in a multi-line container (flex-wrap: wrap) and align-content is set to flex-start. This means that flex lines are packed tightly to the start of the cross axis, leaving no free space for align-self to work.The explanation for Example #3 is the same as for Example #1.The explanation for Example #4 is the same as for Example #2.Example #5 is a single-line container. As such, the cross size of the flex line equals the cross size of the container, leaving no extra space between the two. Therefore, align-content, which aligns flex lines when there is extra space in the cross axis, is having no effect.The initial setting for align-content is stretch. This means that if no other value is specified, the container will distribute available space evenly among flex lines. (A similar effect is created on the main axis when all flex items get flex: 1.)This distribution of space among lines can cause wide gaps between rows / columns. Less lines result in wider gaps. More lines result in smaller gaps, as each line gets a smaller share of the space. To resolve this problem switch from align-content: stretch to align-content: flex-start. This packs the lines together (see examples #2 and #4 above). Of course, this also eliminates any free space in the line, and align-items and align-self can no longer work.Here's a related post: Remove space (gaps) between multiple lines of flex items when they wrapAs explained in previous examples, with align-content: stretch, there can be extra space in the flex lines, which allows align-items and align-self to work. Any other value for align-content would pack the lines, eliminating  extra space, and making align-items and align-self useless.First of all, align-content is useless if there is no wrap:w3c docAlso, in your second case, align-self is not failing. It's useless because the inner lines have been packed. Let's create an space so that the style can work:Similarly, in your 4th example, the style is working, if you set the conditions where it can be seenFinally, when you comment the align-content, it reverts to stretch, that's why the lines increase the size to fill up the container"},

I recently had to create a solution which would work in IE7, so pseudo elements weren't an option in the first place.The technique involves 4 elements:As with previous CSS-only solutions, the technique demands a solid colour background or fixed position background image for the contents: the ellipsis needs to obscure parts of the text, and the fill needs to obscure the ellipsis. You can do a fancy gradient effect to make the text fade into the ellipsis, but I'll leave that cosmetic detail to discretion.Here's a fiddle demonstrating it: resize your browser's width or change the text to see it shift from ellipsis to no-ellipsis.Aside from the arbitrary elegance factor, I believe this is more performant than the popular solution because it doesn't rely on floats (which require a lot of repainting) — absolute positioning is much simpler to compute since there are no inter-dependencies when calculating layout.I wrote a javascript function to fix the multiline ellipsis problemhope this helps!I found a solution for multi-line cross-browser pure CSS ellipsis.

Browsers, being diligent about attempting to render what the author wants rather than what the author wrote have respected <style> elements in the <body> despite those pages technically being invalid.The <style> element continued to be invalid in the <body>In some working drafts of the HTML5.1 spec the <style> element was to allow for a [scoped] attribute, which would allow the <style> element to be used in flow content (i.e. in the <body>).As an example of how that could have been used would be:Support for the scoped feature was added to Firefox in version 21 and added in Chrome behind a flag in version 20. The feature didn't receive enough support, so it was later removed from the HTML5.1 working draft.Chrome was first to remove the feature in version 36. Firefox has since set the feature to be behind a flag in version 55.In the July 2017 working draft of the HTML5.2 spec, support was added for the <style> element to be allowed in flow content:Emphasis mineAt the time of writing this addition has remained in the HTML5.2 spec, which is currently at the Candidate Recommendation maturity level.While this makes using <style> elements in the <body> still somewhat of a risk, this particular change is standardizing something that browsers have supported for many years.There is no standard way (EDIT: as of HTML5 there apparently is!) of adding a <style> element outside of the <head> tag - it is only allowed there and NOT within the <body> tag (See the DTD here).If you want to style your HTML fragments individually and not use CSS styles in your head, you will need to resort to inline styling. However: Most browsers understand <style> tags within the body, so you may as well use them, but your page won't be standards compliant.In any way:From what I understand you use some kind of templating, where you insert different HTML snippets into the page with different designs. Is it so bad if you put all styles within one big CSS file? Would it be impossible for you to dynamically load a another CSS file (via JS or server side scripting), when your HTML fragment gets inserted in the page (this would be the preferred method)?I've found two hacks to do that. Both of which should be perfectly valid html.Wrap your <style /> element inside a <svg /> element.Format your css as a data uri and use that in a <link /> element."},

(this JS works on iOS Webkit, no guarantees for android, but please let me know the results)Hope this helps...Speaking from experience, expect to put a lot of time into this, even for a barebones viewer. An ePub reader was actually first big project I took on when I started learning C#, but the ePub standard is definitely pretty complex.You can find the latest version of the spec for ePub here:\nhttp://www.idpf.org/specs.htm\nwhich includes the OPS (Open Publication Structure), OPF (Open Packaging Format), and OCF (OEBPS Container Format).Also, if it helps you at all, here is a link to the C# source code of the project I started on:https://www.dropbox.com/sh/50kxcr29831t854/MDITIklW3I/ePub%20Test.zipIt's not fleshed out at all; I haven't played with this for months, but if I remember correctly, just stick an ePub in the debug directory, and when you run the program just type some part of the name (e.g. Under the Dome, just type \"dome\") and it will display the details of the book. I had it working correctly for a few books, but any eBooks from Google Books broke it completely. They have a completely bizarre implementation of ePub (to me, at least) compared to books from other sources. Anyway, hopefully some of the structural code in there might help you out!I've had to code something like this too, and my (working) solution is this:You have to apply these lines to the webview...Also, you have to inject some javascript. I've had tons of problems with the differents scales of my activity and the content rendered in the webview, so my solution doesn't take any kind of value from \"outside\".[...]Enjoy :)I recently attempted something similar to this and added some CSS styling to change the layout to horizontal instead of vertical. This gave me the desired effect without having to modify the content of the Epub in any way.This code should work.So, basically you're injecting JavaScript to change the styling of the body element after the chapter has been loaded (very important). The only downfall to this approach is when you have images in the content the calculated column count goes askew. It shouldn't be too hard to fix though. My attempt was going to be injecting some JavaScript to add width and height attributes to all images in the DOM that don't have any.Hope it helps.-DanMaybe it would work to use XSL-FO. This seems heavy for a mobile device, and maybe it's overkill, but it should work, and you wouldn't have to implement the complexities of good pagination (e.g. how do you make sure that each screen doesn't cut text in half) yourself.The basic idea would be:I don't know whether there is an XSL-FO processor available for Android. You could try Apache FOP. RenderX (XSL-FO processor) has the advantage of having a paged-HTML output option, but again I don't know if it could run on Android.There is several ways this could be done. If every line is in its own element all you have to do is to check if one of it's edges goes outside of the view (either the browsers, or the \"book page\").If you want to know how many \"pages\" there is going to be in advance, just temporary move them into the view and get what line a page ends. This could potentially be slow because of that page reflow is needed for the browser to know where anything is.Otherwise I think that you could use the HTML5 canvas element to measure text and / or draw text.Some info on that here:\n    https://developer.mozilla.org/en/Drawing_text_using_a_canvas\n    http://uupaa-js-spinoff.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/uupaa-excanvas.js/demo/8_2_canvas_measureText.htmlHad this same problem recently and inspired by the answers found a plain CSS solution using CSS3's column-* attributes:The example above gives great results on a retina iPhone. Playing around with the different attributes yields in different spacing between the pages and such.If you need to support multiple chapters for instance which need to start on new pages, there's an XCode 5 example on github: https://github.com/dmrschmidt/ios_uiwebview_paginationI was able to improve Nacho's solution to get horizontal swipe paging effect with WebView. You can find solution here and example code.Edit:Solution code.MainActivity.javaIn my WebChromeClient's onJsAlert get the number of horizontal pages which i pass to the custom HorizontalWebView to implement paging effect HorizontalWebView.javaYou could split the pages in separate XHTML files and store them in a folder. Eg: page01, page02. You can then render those pages one by one underneath each other.You can look at http://www.litres.ru/static/OR/or.html?data=/static/trials/00/42/47/00424722.gur.html&art=424722&user=0&trial=1 but the code may be heavily obfuscated, so just use Firebug to  inspect DOM.If the link isn't working, comment - would give you fixed."},

You are treating the <a> tag as if it represents the page which is not the case. $('head') will work as long as this selector is being executed by the page that needs the css.Why not simply add the css file to the page in question. Any particular reason to attempt this dynamically from another page? I am not even familiar with a way to inject css to remote pages like this ... seems like it would be a major security hole.ADDENDUM to your reasoning: Then you should simply pass a parameter to the page, read it using javascript, and then do whatever is needed based on the parameter.Try doing it the other way around.I don't think you can attach down into a window that you are instancing... I KNOW you can't do it if the url's are on different domains (XSS and all that jazz), but you can talk UP from that window and access elements of the parent window assuming they are on the same domain. your best bet is to attach the stylesheet at the page you are loading, and if that page isn't on the same domain, (e.g. trying to restyle some one else's page,) you won't be able to.Have you tried simply using the media attribute for you css reference?Or set it to screen if you don't want the printed version to use the style:This way you don't need to add it dynamically."},

I noticed it used in the MUI buttons examplesFirst install it:npm install --save clsxThen import it in your component file:import clsx from  'clsx';Then use the imported function in your component:<div className={ clsx(classes.container, classes.spacious)}>I think this will solve your problem:and in react component: Yes, jss-composes provides you this:And then you just use classes.spacious.If you want to assign multiple class names to your element, you can use arrays.So in your code above, if this.props.classes resolves to something like ['container', 'spacious'], i.e. if you can simply assign it to div asand result will beAs already mentioned, you can use string interpolation And you can try classnames library, \nhttps://www.npmjs.com/package/classnamesclassNames package can also be used as advanced as:"},

You're not changing your CSS document with that function and thus adding and removing and adding the class have no effect since it hasn't been modified at all!You should use the same function but set the background color to black this time.Or simply remove the style attributeI know this is old, but you can just set the value to an empty string to remove your custom style like so:What about toggleClass(\"testThing\")? I use it when there's more than one property to change.http://api.jquery.com/toggleClass/It is better to just add another class that overrides the style you want to change and then remove it. It beats hard coding style info inside the js.\nThe only issue is youll have to ensure the added class is of a higher order so that the element takes the style from it rather than the existing class but this is not hard to ensure."},

Is it still perfectly valid to use 3-digit codes over 6-digit codes, or are we supposed to use the full 6-digit codes?The 3-digit codes are shorthand, #123 is the same as #112233. In the example you give, you've (effectively) swapped #FDFEFF for #FFFFFF, which is close to the original colour but obviously not exact.It doesn't \"matter\" which version you use, as such, but 3-digit colour codes mean you have a little less choice in shades. If you feel that saving 300 bytes is worth that, then go ahead and use the 3-digit codes, but unless you're designing for a low-bandwidth situation those 300 bytes won't really save you all that much.Shorthand sucks! Don't use it. It's harder to maintain and creates unnecessary variation e.g. when searching and replacing a colour value (\"oh, now I have to take into consideration #FFFFFF and white and #FFF\"). What you save in size is never worth what you lose in maintainability. Use minifaction and compression to save bandwidth.If you want to save bytes then you better use CSS minification techniquesIf you use this in a table in IE 7 8 or 9 (unfortunately this is relevant as of the date of this response)http://www.w3schools.com/html/tryit.asp?filename=tryhtml_tables  6 digit codes work fine but 3 digit codes render as blackIf the \"3 digit\" versions produces the colour you need then you can use it as much as you like. It's certainly not wrong.I always use the shorthand. The best advantage is that I can easily remember the codes.You still have 163 = 4,096 colors to choose from, should be enough.However if you save 300 bytes in shorthand color codes it means you have 100 colors decleared in your CSS. Unless your page is very diverse, or all rainbows and flowers it seems like a lot. You might be good at systematic CSS, but I often see unneccesary css rules. EX: if you're setting the same rule to many child elements that could have been replaced with setting the rule on the grandparent and in one exception element instead.That is true, but this transformation is not general:So what it does is it \"doubles\" each hexadecimal digit. So it is not the same color. It is however possible that it looks the same because the differences are minute. A calibrated color workflow could help in this case.It does not matter whether you use shorthand or normal hex colours, so go ahead and convert them if you desire. Wow, a full 300 bytes! :D, sarcasm ftwThe thing is unless you're going to minify, compress and combine all of your css, javascript etc 300 bytes is barely worth bothering with, especially as the average internet speed is increasing.Have fun!It is not possible, please go through how the hexadecimal color code works.For few color codes we can reduce it to 3 digits, however, for the many hexadecimal color codes we cannot turn that down to 3 digits.

You can also preload some logos, icons and scripts.Other techniques pro/cons are discussed here (not my blog).There are a few techniques for \"preloading\" here:\nhttp://paulirish.com/2009/fighting-the-font-face-fout/Mostly tricking the browser into downloading the file as fast as possible..You can also deliver it as a data-uri, which helps a lot.\nand also you could hide the page content and show it when its ready.Proper font pre-loading is a big hole in the HTML5 spec.\nI've gone through all of this stuff and the most reliable solution I've found is to use Font.js:http://pomax.nihongoresources.com/pages/Font.js/You can use it to load fonts using the same API you use to load imagesIt's much simpler and more lightweight than Google's hulking Webfont LoaderHere's the github repo for Font.js:https://github.com/Pomax/Font.jsThis should solve your problem.To answer your initial question: yes you can. Only Gecko and WebKit browsers support it currently though.\nYou just need to add link tags in your head:Via Google's webfontloader i did this by adding some letter in my main document and made it transparent and assigned the font that I wanted to load.e.g.Use the standard CSS Font Loading API.Wait for (all) the fonts to load, and then show your content:Demo CodePen.Recently I was working on a game compatible with CocoonJS with DOM limited to the canvas element - here is my approach:Using fillText with a font that has not been loaded yet will execute properly but with no visual feedback - so the canvas plane will stay intact - all you have to do is periodically check the canvas for any changes (for example looping through getImageData searching for any non transparent pixel) that will happen when the font loads properly.I have explained this technique a little bit more in my recent article http://rezoner.net/preloading-font-face-using-canvas,686Google has a nice library for this: https://developers.google.com/webfonts/docs/webfont_loader\nYou can use almost any fonts and the lib will add classes to the html tag. It even gives you javascript events on when certrain fonts are loaded and active!Don't forget to serve your fontfiles gzipped! it will certainly speed things up!As I found the best way is doing is preloading a stylesheet that contains the font face, and then let browser to load it automatically. I used the font-face in other locations (in the html page), but then I could observe the font changing effect briefly. then in the font.css file, specify as following.You can't assign a name to fonts when it's preloaded through link tag (correct me if I was wrong I couldn't find a way yet), and thus you have to use font-face to assign the name to the font. Even though it's possible to load a font through link tag, it's not recommended as you can't assign a name to the font with it. Without a name as with font-face, you won't be able to use it anywhere in the web page. According to gtmetrix, style sheet loads at the beginning, then rest of the scripts/style by order, then the font before dom is loaded, and therefore you don't see font changing effect. Your head should include the preload rel as follows:This way woff2 will be preloaded by browsers that support preload, and all the fallback formats will load as they normally do.\nAnd your css font face should look similar to to this"},

Use the same image 4 times to make up the 4 steps of the progress bar, and align top for incomplete steps, and align bottom for incomplete steps.In order to take advantage of image alignment, you'd have to use the image as the background for 4 divs, rather than using the img element.

Is there a way to minimise/get rid of this delay, by delaying the page rendering until after fonts have loaded or similar.This is down to how the browser behaves.First off where is your @font declared?  Is it inline to your HTML, declared in a CSS sheet on the page, or (hopefully) declared in an external CSS sheet?If it is not in an external sheet, try moving it to one (this is better practice anyway usually).If this doesn't help, you need to ask yourself is the fraction of a second difference really significantly detrimental to the user experience?  If it is, then consider JavaScript, there are a few things you might be able to do, redirects, pauses etc, but these might actually be worse than the original problem.  Worse for users, and worse to maintain.This link might help:http://paulirish.com/2009/fighting-the-font-face-fout/Edit: The best approach is probably to base64 encode your fonts.  This means your font will have to be loaded fully by the time your HTML is parsed and displayed.  You can do this with font squirrel's webfont generator https://www.fontsquirrel.com/tools/webfont-generator by clicking \"Expert\" and then \"base64 encode\".  This is how services like TypeKit work.Original answer:\nAnother way to detect if fonts are loaded would be using FontLoader https://github.com/smnh/FontLoader or by copying their strategy.They bind to the scroll event in the browser, because when the font loads it will resize the text.  It uses two containing divs (that will scroll when the height changes) and a separate fallback for IE.An alternative is to check the DOM periodically with setInterval, but using javascript events is far faster and superior.Obviously, you might do something like set the opacity of body to 0 and then display it in once the font loads.Joni Korpi has a nice article on loading fonts before the rest of the page.http://jonikorpi.com/a-smoother-page-load/He also uses a loading.gif to alleviate the delay so users won't get frustrated. Only IE loads first the font and then the rest of the page.\nThe other browsers load things concurrently for a reason. Imagine that there's a problem with the server hosting the font or with the font downloading.\nYou will hang your entire site until the font is loaded. On my opinion a flash of unstyled text is better than not seeing the site at allSince nobody mentioned that, I believe this question needs an update. The way I managed to solve the problem was using the \"preload\" option supported by modern browsers.In case someone does not need to support old browsers.some useful links with more details:https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Preloading_content\nhttp://www.bramstein.com/writing/preload-hints-for-web-fonts.htmlUse https://github.com/typekit/webfontloaderand check the events in the configuration\nhttps://github.com/typekit/webfontloader#configurationYou can use CSS font-display inside your @font-face. \nThe keywords for all the available values are:Giulio Mainardi has written a nice article about all of them, and which you should use where on sitepoint.You can read it here: https://www.sitepoint.com/css-font-display-future-font-rendering-web/?utm_source=frontendfocus&utm_medium=emailThis code works very well for me.

In other words, cells can span across columns and rows, which flexbox cannot do.This is why flexbox has a limited capacity for building grids. It's also a reason why the W3C has developed another CSS3 technology, Grid Layout (see below).In a flex container with flex-flow: row wrap, flex items must wrap to new rows.This means that a flex item cannot wrap under another item in the same row.Notice above how div #3 wraps below div #1, creating a new row. It cannot wrap beneath div #2.As a result, when items aren't the tallest in the row, white space remains, creating unsightly gaps.image credit: Jefree SujitIf you switch to flex-flow: column wrap, flex items will stack vertically and a grid-like layout is more attainable. However, a column-direction container has three potential problems right off the bat:As a result, a column-direction container may not be feasible in many cases.What you want can be achieved in 3  2 ways, CSS wise:(this solution has the very neat advantage of built-in column-span - pretty handy for titles). The disadvantage is ordering items in columns (first column contains first third of the items and so on...). I made a jsFiddle for this.absolute positioning after calculating rendered item sizes, via JavaScript (masonry plugin).the column approach seems a good compromise if you set column-width via vmin or vmax units and drop column-count (first snippet) , display:grid and vmin is also an option for the futur (second snippet).test demo with vmin a link among others https://web-design-weekly.com/2014/11/18/viewport-units-vw-vh-vmin-vmax/display:grid coud make it also easy with auto-fill but will require to set a span value to tallest image so rows and columns can inbricateyou can see https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/You can achieve the masonry effect as per your screenshot, but you've set the height of the outer div dynamicallyInstead of flexbox, I recommend to use columns for grids like this.

I needed to have an image aligned to the right, and exactly 170px from the top. And need text to flow on top, left and bottom of image. \nSo what I did is create a  that is of 0px width, with 170px of height and float right. Then the img would float and clear right and voila!Worked pretty well :)The simplest solution i found is to wrap img inside a div element and then use padding-top and margin-bottom values to align it.This is my CSSand here is the HTMLThe reason padding and margin worked for me is because I use it inside the parent element \"contentDiv\" to auto adjust height of the div according to the content. Not sure if its of any use.For a jQuery solution, try the lowFloat plugin created by gilly3: https://github.com/gilly3/lowFloatFurther to the solution posted, I've used a quick JQuery hack to dynamically \nadjust the height of the pusher, by taking the height of the area I wanted to bottom-right align away from the height of the content area, and applying it to the pusher div, as so: It needs a few slight tweaks, but generally works as well as you're going to get!The solution I found involves that you have a div whose width does not changes, nor does the amount of text. Then you can position the image inside the text and have it align=right. So if you have correct amount of text around it, then you you get the image on the right and at the bottom of the div.Ok. So I've actually had this same problem and at some point the answer hit me like Saturday night cheese cake. It's almost the same hit and miss effect that you have when you try to set text wrapping in Word.Now all you have to do is just set it INSIDE the text where you want the lines to break. The text will float to the end of the text so it will always push the text to the left but if you put the image in the middle of the text like...the top part stays where it is and text is free to float above the image and the rest is pushed to the left of the image. It's a workaround but not nearly as tedious as using JS and if you use a WYSIWYG editor it's even easier. Come to think of it if you use a WYSIWYG editor it has that feature automatically. :P Problem solved.Cheers."},

I needed y-axis scrolling for a table inside of a ui dialog (yes, you heard me right).  I was lucky, in that a working solution presented itself fairly quickly.  However, it wasn't long before the solution took on a life of its own, but more on that later.The problem with just setting the top level elements (thead, tfoot, and tbody) to display block, is that browser synchronization of the column sizes between the various components is quickly lost and everything packs to the smallest permissible size.  Setting the widths of the columns seems like the best course of action, but without setting the widths of all the internal table components to match the total of these columns, even with a fixed table layout, there is a slight divergence between the headers and body when a scroll bar is present.The solution for me was to set all the widths, check if a scroll bar was present, and then take the scaled widths the browser had actually decided on, and copy those to the header and footer adjusting the last column width for the size of the scroll bar.  Doing this provides some fluidity to the column widths.  If changes to the table's width occur, most major browsers will auto-scale the tbody column widths accordingly.  All that's left is to set the header and footer column widths from their respective tbody sizes.This fiddle illustrates these notions: http://jsfiddle.net/borgboyone/gbkbhngq/.Note that a table wrapper or additional tables are not needed for y-axis scrolling alone.  (X-axis scrolling does require a wrapping table.)  Synchronization between the column sizes for the body and header will still be lost if the minimum pack size for either the header or body columns is encountered.  A mechanism for minimum widths should be provided if resizing is an option or small table widths are expected.The ultimate culmination from this starting point is fully realized here: http://borgboyone.github.io/jquery-ui-table/A.try this.mandatory parts:"},

Like - Well, this is an old one, but I hit it too. My solution was a bit different:-The benefit of this approach is that the structure and position of the main div and child elements can remain unchanged throughout. This means that when you want to show the main div, you can simply remove the covering image. Also, if you want to see what the main div would look like when debugging you can just remove the covering image element in the browser debugger tools, such as firebug in firefox or ctrl+shift+i in chrome. Just remember to set the z-index on an element it needs to be positioned absolute, relative or fixed. If you have any problems getting the z-index to take effect it is probably to do with stacking contexts. See here for a good description of how to solve this.I know this is an older post and someone already accepted the answer but I prefer this method. JQuery will move the element to the body (or any other selected location) via the append() method. I store the parent in a variable and detach() it so if you need to put it all back together later you can easily do:And everything is back the way it was.I used simple JavaScript with querySelector to remove all target elements, while keeping what is inside them (now you can just apply any CSS selector):"},

Why would you not want your HTML to be minified?Because if you're doing things properly you're serving HTML gzipped anyway, so the low-hanging fruit of HTML minification - whitespace - isn't all that relevant. There aren't lots of easy targets (e.g. variable names) for minification in HTML, which are present in CSS and JavaScript. Much of the content of HTML is the actual content of the page, which probably can't be minified (and, as others have pointed out, will almost certainly vary more frequently than your CSS or JS).I'd guess that most sites have static CSS and Javascript. This means they can be minified just once whenever they are updated. On the other hand, HTML tends to be dynamically generated, which means it would have to be minified on every page request, which is considerably more expensive than minifying static CSS and Javascript files.I don't think there is that much room for minification in HTML: You can remove white spaces and line breaks, but essentially, that's about it without actually getting into the page's structure. JS minification can shorten variable and function names, probably the biggest net profit in terms of saved space. With its fixed set of tags, HTML does not provide that possibility. The option of gzipping HTML probably eliminates much of the need to minify anyway, especially as it is usually enabled for HTML, while it (unnecessarily) not always is for the CSS and JS file types.Primarily because Javascript files and CSS stylesheets are often static files that will not change upon deployment. Markup, on the other hand, is often generated on the fly (with database-driven web apps, at least), and the number of \"pages\" is usually large and dynamic, which makes the benefits of minification more work than it's worth.Html content being gzipped takes care of most of the compression, minifying on top of that wouldn't accomplish much or save a great deal of bandwidth.Javascript you can minify as part of the build, the only way this would happen with the entire HTML content would be to minify every piece (what if it's generated?) or to have it minified the whole time (nightmare to work on?)  It's cost vs benefit, cost: marginal bandwidth, benefit: easier to work on, easier to generate, easier to debug, pretty in my source view window."},

It hides the scrollbar in the case that you don't need it without hiding possible extra option elements in the other case. Don't do all this hacky overlapping div stuff. It just makes for unreadable markup.No, you can't control the look of a select box in such detail.A select box is usually displayed as a dropdown list, but there is nothing that says that it always has to be displayed that way. How it is displayed depends on the system, and on some mobile phones for example you don't get a dropdown at all, but a selector that covers most or all of the screen.If you want to control how your form elements look in such detail, you have to make your own form controls out of regular HTML elements (or find someone else who has already done that).You can use a <div> to cover the scrollbar if you really want it to disappear.\nAlthough it won't work on IE6, modern browsers do let you put a <div> on top of it.Chrome (and maybe other webkit browsers) only:my cross-browser .no-scroll snippet:Like Guffa said, you cannot reliably get that much control over native controls.  The best way is probably to make a box of elements with radio buttons beside each item, then use labels and JavaScript to make the 'rows' interactive, so clicking on a radio button or label will color the selected row.Change padding-bottom , i.e may be the simplest possible way . I worked out Arraxas solution to:For future reference if somebody else runs into this problem.\nI found a solution that should work in all modern browsers:Basically this way the scrollbar is set to a width of 0 and is hence not displayed.I think you can't.

Setting the radius to 50% doesn't seem to give the desired affect.Applying a very large border radius seems to work on many browsers (IE9+, FF, Chrome) like this mod of David's fiddle http://jsfiddle.net/cthQW/1/Yes, this is possible (albeit I've only tested in Chromium 28/Ubuntu 12.10):JS Fiddle demo.The important information is, obviously, the 20%/50% property-value; the 20% is the 'horizontal length' of the radius, whereas the 50% is the 'vertical length'; using two different measurements gives an elliptical curve to the border, instead of a single measurement, which yields the more circular radius. Obviously this requires a certain amount of adjustment to your own requirementsReferences:If you use percentages, it takes the element width to calculate the radius. To have the capsule-shaped element, you need to pass to the border-radius property units like rem or px (neither I know the reason for this, but it works). This is why it works when passing 500px. You can use the same value for line-height and border-radius properties if you want.Here you have an example in CodePen. Try to change the variable $label-height to see how the shape is maintained while the height of the button changes.In this example, you don't need to set the width or height of the element. You just need to adjust the content's height and padding.The padding property is useful to set a separation between the contents and the component border. See how it looks if I only set the left padding.If you set the line-height property of the container, you will set automatically the container height, and center the content inside the container at the same time.If you want to set the component's width to the component's content width, you can set the component's display property to inline-block, and use FlexBox to arrange them in a column, for example. And then, set the left and right margins to auto, to avoid the element to grow to its parent width.And if you want to leave a space between the components, you can set the margin-top property between consecutive components.Hope it helps :)This is what I have found to work well:border-radius: 50vh;Browser support looks good for that now too.To explain, the vh is a \"Viewport Unit\" that computes the height of the viewport in pixels. By saying 50vh to declare the border radius, it is 50% * (Viewport Height)px.This can be easily achieved using HTML Span. You have to just set the background-color and border-radius."},

If there is any style defined for\ndiv tag in your style sheet it will be applied to all div elements.Few things that you can try is don't style with tag name  instead give class name and give style declaration to class. so that you can make sure where all styles will go.OR. if you want some specific Div tag to not have the style while other Divs to have. you can always reset it give some different class name or id and reset the style declarationsOld question, but things have changed a little bit since the accepted answer. There is now a CSSWG-recommended keyword called revert which would be better suited than initial and unset to solve this problem, as it resets an element's property to the value defined in the user agent stylesheet rather than the initial value of the property regardless of which element it's used on. So for instance, a div inside #mydiv will have its display set to block as we would expect and not inline.You'd have to do this:Unfortunately, revert is not supported by any browser other than Safari (for Mac and iOS) at the time of writing.There is also something else to take in consideration regarding the accepted answer. If you want to style anything inside #mydiv, you need to do so with a selector that is at least as specific as the one you used to unset or revert everything, otherwise it will be overridden by that rule, even if it comes after it in the CSS.So you'd need to do something like this (note the #mydiv which boost the specificity of the rules):One thing that might be helpful is the CSS direct child selector, which is available in all browsers including IE7+. That lets you apply styling that doesn't cascade down into children. For example in your code you could use this CSS:And that CSS would only apply to elements directly on the BODY element.iframe is also a decent solution for isolation of styles if it doesn't complicate other business logic. Plus this can be done in pure JavaScript and may work in older browsers too.This worked perfectly for me when I had to embed a complex HTML file into my webpage fetched remotely without MixedContent warning and without parent HTML styles overriding the embedded HTML. Thanks to https://benfrain.com/sandbox-local-htmlcss-code-snippets-inside-iframe-style-guidespattern-libraries/ for this excellent idea!Though #mydiv * { all: unset } CSS trick, as suggested in the accepted solution here works, it ended being a complex browser operation as there were many DOM nodes on my page."},

One way of fixing issues like this is to use display:inline property. So, create a custom CSS class with display:inline and attach it to your component with a .form-control class. You have to have a width for your component as well.There are other ways of handling this issue (like arranging your form-control components inside any of the .col classes), but the easiest way is to just make your .form-control an inline element (the way a span would render)Not sure if this was available in 2014, but you can now.It only works on screen resolutions greater than 768px though.Valid for BS 3.3.7:Unfortunately if you run the snippet it won't look right here, because it's in a frame that has a narrow width, but if you copy it somewhere else and run it on a wide screen it will work.

EDIT: Updated the broken link to the blog post.I had the same bug.I fixed it by executing this script on domready (only for IE8 of course):This lets IE8 redraw all :before and :after pseudo elementsI recently encountered this as well, and fixed it by including the @font-face twice in my CSS file. The first @font-face is used by IE and the second is used by other browsers.Source: http://www.boonex.com/n/ie8-icon-font-fix-and-unused-language-keys-2012-08-20I was experimenting exactly the same problem. In IE8 the webfont icon (using pseudo-elements) sometimes renders the fallback font but when you hover it the webfont icon comes visible.The icons were implemented using :after and :before with IE7 support, like this.In my case, the project is developed in HTML5 and using htmlshiv to support the new HTML5 tags in older browsers.The problem was ridiculously solved placing the html5shiv script tag below the main CSS:I'm happy now :) I hope that helps!I was having a similar issue where the font would not show up until I hovered over the parent element. I was able to fix this problem by triggering a focus event on the elements parent.element.parent().trigger('focus');Hope this helps someone!Workaround:Find stylesheet and reload on document ready if IE8:Sample HTML:Sample JavaScript:The above solutions didn't fix the issue for me when IE8 is refreshed. Also I found some problems where adding a stylesheet would break the IE8 background size fix backgroundsize.min.htcSo here's what I did:Add ie8 class to html tag:Add loading class to the body:Override the CSS content attribute only for IE8:Now remove the loading class on DOM ready:Now it works!Based on the answer from @ausi, you can refactor this with jQuery and CoffeeScript down to 4 lines:or with JavaScript syntax:I had a similar glitch in Chrome. Here is my fix:My guess is that the pseudo css styling was rendered before the webfont was ready, which resulted in blank glyphs. After the page loaded, hovering or altering the css in any way caused them to magically appear. So my fix just forces a css update that does nothing.For me, the problem was simply solved using the declaration !important on the content attribute. I.e.:Alright, so I've been trying to fix this issue for a while.\nWeirdly enough the icomoon demo kept working in IE8 but mine never did, even though I felt like I had pretty much the same thing in place. So I started boiling everything down (the icomoon demo as well as my own implementation) and what I found two things that needed to be there for this to work.First, I found that I needed to keep the cachebuster on the filename.So in my implementation I had:But what I needed was:Second, and this one doesn't make sense, is that I needed something in the stylesheet that had a :hover pseudo selector. It doesn't matter what it's on or what the rules for it are, it just needed something and then the icons would appear when I hovered over them.So I simply inserted [data-icon]:hover{} into my CSS stylesheet (just like that, without any rules).I wish I could explain to you why this works, but I don't understand. My best guess is that this triggers some sort of refresh in IE8 and causes the icons to show up.My IE8 issue was solved by removing the double-colon in the pseudo-element selector.Does not display an icon in IE8...Does display an icon in IE8...Ok so here's a variation of @ausi's solution that I've used which has worked for me. This solution comes from Adam's comment at the bottom of this article http://andymcfee.com/2012/04/04/icon-fonts-pseudo-elements-and-ie8/I thought I'd put it here in more detail to make it quicker for others to use. Set an extra class eg. ie-loading-fix on the html tag for IE8.\nInclude all your CSS and then after that have a conditional JS file for IE8. For example:Then at the top of your main CSS file include something like:Then in your IE8 js/ie.js file include the following:This JS will remove the ie-loading-fix styling which is hiding all :before and :after content and will force IE8 to redraw all :before and :after content once the page has loaded.This solution fixed an issue I was having with Font Awesome v4.4 which would frequently switch IE8 into Compatibility View or crash even though I was explicitly setting the page to load in Edge mode using the meta tag.If I am not wrong then IE doesn't reads TTF font, it requires EOT fontsI did some research as per @vieron answer and it turns out that another way to fix this problem is to block page rendering for a few miliseconds so font could be loaded before content. Though, blocking page rendering isn't smartest way to solve this, because you can't know how much ms you should block.I proved it by putting php file as source file for javascript.block.phpIf you have any external javascript libraries such as HTML5shiv, this happens automagically, except you are running site on local network (intranet or localhost) with very low latency and no scripts before content.That explains the fact that the problem isn't more widespreaded and noticed.I really tried hard to find an elegant solution, but I can't find something that excludes javascript or blocking page rendering for IE.This is the fix,  we have faced this issue with IE7, IE8 and IE9 when using ajax"},

It works with Google Chrome.Example (JSFiddle):HTMLCSSUpdate: Matthew Wise has a really clever alternative solution which you should consider—especially if you're having trouble with my approach or dislike ugly hacks!There is a way to cover windowed elements in IE with other elements, but you're not going to like it.Legacy IE categorises elements into two types: windowed and windowless.Regular elements like div and input are windowless. They are rendered by the browser itself in a single MSHTML plane and respect each other's z-order.Elements rendered outside of MSHTML are windowed; for example, select (rendered by the OS) and ActiveX controls. They respect each other's z-order, but occupy a separate MSHTML plane that is painted on top of all windowless elements.The only exception is iframe. In IE 5, iframe was a windowed element. This was changed in IE 5.5; it is now a windowless element, but for backwards compatibility reasons it will still draw over windowed elements with a lower z-indexIn other words: iframe respects z-index for both windowed and windowless elements. If you position an iframe over a windowed element, any windowless elements positioned over the iframe will be visible!The PDF will always be painted on top of the regular page content—like select elements were until IE 7. The fix is to position another iframe between your content and the PDF.jsFiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/Jordan/gDuCE/HTML:​\nCSS:This has been tested and should work in IE 7–9. If you feel persnickety about it showing up in the DOM for other browsers, you can add it with JavaScript or wrap it in an IE-only conditional comment:The workaround with the additional IFRAME does work in simple cases but I have spent a morning trying to get the overlay to respect transparency. Basically our application has modal popups whereby a full-window overlay behind the popups is rendered 'greyed out' (background colour black, opacity 0.25) to indicate to the user that the pop-ups are modal. With the workaround, the embedded PDF view never gets greyed out with the rest of the window so still looks 'active' and indeed you can still interact with the PDF viewer.Our solution is to use Mozilla's pdf.js library: https://github.com/mozilla/pdf.js/ - embedding an IFRAME pointing at the test URL http://mozilla.github.com/pdf.js/web/viewer.html?file=compressed.tracemonkey-pldi-09.pdf works straight out of the box respecting z-index, transparency, the lot, no hacks required! Seems that they use their own rendering engine which generates standard HTML representing the content of the PDF.I Had been trying to fix the same issue and my scenario was similar. I was trying to render a youtube Video on my page and on top of the video i wanted to place some div with some information.But the youtube video being contained into an iframe wasn't letting me do that.

The rationale is that by invoking 3D transformation, re-paint is separated from the rest of the CSS pain stack (I can't provide much more detail than that, it's pretty much all Greek to me). In any case, it appears to work for me!This is not a generic solution (will need to be tweaked depending on the positioning requirements of the element in question). It works by forcing continuous repaints (via CSS animation) on a property that could affect layout (forcing other layout factors to be calculated and rendered, ie maintaining fixed positioning), but in practice do not. In this case, I've used margin-bottom, because there's no way that's going to affect your page layout (but Opera doesn't know that!):Note: the solution is not perfect, in that (on my machine at least) the bug test cases will result in a minute flicker as Opera loses positioning and quickly redraws. Sadly I think this is as good as you will get, because as George says in his answer, this is Opera's natural behaviour between redraws — in theory my code makes redraw for the element continuous, but in practice there will be infinitesimal gaps.EDIT 2 (2013-11-05): I've since encountered variations of this bug quite often. Although the original poster's reduced test case presents a perfectly legitimate bug, most occurences have been in situations where there is already a 3D transform operating on the body (or similarly high up the DOM tree). This is often used as a hack to force GPU rendering, but will actually lead to nasty repaint issues like this. 2 no-op 3D transforms don't make a right: if you're using one higher up the tree, try removing it first before adding another one.EDIT 3 (2014-12-19): Chris reports that translateZ(0) doesn't work in some cases where scale3d(1,1,1) does.The key for Chrome is:By adding this, the fixed position problem should be fixed.It makes sense if you understand how Normal Flow of the document works. Let's say it's an edge case scenario. There is no height declared in any element and #sidebar is taken OUT of the normal flow of the document by being position:fixed.If you add a height property to #sidebar (pixels, not percentages) the problem is solved.I would suggest including Normalize.css, I think it will take care of the bug.

However 40,000 divs sounds like way too many and you will probably have better performance using canvas or SVG (for example, using the KineticJS library as this handles animations - transformation, rotation, scale, etc.) for you.They all render the element invisible, yet differ in whether it occupies space and consumes clicksAnd when we say it consumes click, that means it also consumes other pointer events like ondblclick,onmousedown,onmousemove etc.In essence \"visibility: hidden\" behaves like a combination of \"opacity: 0\" and \"pointer-events: none\".display:none because the divs are taken out of the flow then, thus their position does not have to be calculated.That being said, 40000 divs sounds crazy. Did you consider the alternatives like HTML5 canvas or SVG?Perfomamce will be an issue if display:none or visibility:hidden is used since they trigger paint and layout in most browsers which means your browser will redraw the viewport whenever those two changes so I will recommend opacity but still for that number of divs it will still be not perfomant as expected you can try webgl using a library called html-gl which render your divs in webgl check https://github.com/PixelsCommander/HTML-GLdisplay:none will hide the whole element and remove that from layout space whereas visibility:hidden hides an element but take up the same space as before.\nOpacity can be used if you want to create transparency or fade effect. Sometime i use visibility and opacity together to achieve effect to avoid click evente.g. normal state/element removed from screen:hover state/element on screen:display:none : occupies no space, no elements here.opacity:0 : occupies space, you can click on element behind it.visibility:hidden : occupies space and you can not click element behind it."},

I could be wrong but didn't <strong> and <em> came on the scene quite a while after font-weight and font-style became standard CSS properties? If so, there must be some reason for them.HTML represents meaning; CSS represents appearance. How you mark up text in a document is not determined by how that text appears on screen, but simply what it means. As another example, some other HTML elements, like headings, are styled font-weight: bold by default, but they are marked up using <h1>–<h6>, not <strong> or <b>.In HTML5, you use <strong> to indicate important parts of a sentence, for example:And you use <em> to indicate linguistic stress, for example:These elements are semantic elements that just happen to have bold and italic representations by default, but you can style them however you like. For example, in the <em> sample above, you could represent stress emphasis in uppercase instead of italics, but the functional purpose of the <em> element remains the same — to change the context of a sentence by emphasizing specific words or phrases over others:Note that the original answer (below) applied to HTML standards prior to HTML5, in which <strong> and <em> had somewhat different meanings, <b> and <i> were purely presentational and had no semantic meaning whatsoever. Like <strong> and <em> respectively, they have similar presentational defaults but may be styled differently.You use <strong> and <em> to indicate intense emphasis and normal emphasis respectively.Or think of it this way: font-weight: bold is closer to <b> than <strong>, and font-style: italic is closer to <i> than <em>. These visual styles are purely visual: tools like screen readers aren't going to understand what bold and italic mean, but some screen readers are able to read <strong> and <em> text in a more emphasized tone.YES! There is a clear difference.The <em> element represents stress emphasis of its contents. The level of emphasis that a particular piece of content has is given by its number of ancestor <em> elements.The placement of emphasis changes the meaning of the sentence. The element thus forms an integral part of the content. The precise way in which emphasis is used in this way depends on the language.Reference (examples): See W3C ReferenceThe problem is an issue of semantic meaning (as BoltClock mentions) and visual rendering.Originally HTML used <b> and <i> for these purposes, entirely stylistic commands, laid down in the semantic environment of the document markup.  CSS is an attempt to separate out as far as possible the stylistic elements of the medium.  Thus style information such as bold and italics should go in CSS.<strong> and <em> were introduced to fill the semantic need for text to be marked as more important or stressed.  They have default stylistic interpretations akin to bold and italic, but they are not bound to that fate.<strong> and <em> are semantic markup elements, ex: a machine (a search engine bot, a screen reader) may be able to understand that a strong element is more important than other elements.CSS styles are the way you visualize them for humans, conventionally in bold or italic text.Separation of presentation and content on Wikipedia<strong> and <em> - unlike <b> and <i> - have clear purpose for web browsers for the blind. A blind person doesn't browse the web visually, but by sound such as text readers. <strong> and <em>, in addition to encouraging something to be bold or italic, also convey loudness or stressing syllables respectively (OH MY! & Ooooooh Myyyyyyy!). Audio-only browsers are unpredictable when it comes to <b> and <i>... they may make them loud or stress them or they may not... you never can be sure unless you use <strong> and <em>."},

Id has the highest specificity, then class, then tag. Your first rule is now more specific than the second one, since they both have a class selector, but the first one also has two tag selectors.To make the second one override the first one, you can make more specific by adding information of it's parents:Here is a nice article for more information on selector precedence.The important needs to be inside the ;in fact i believe this should override it"},

I can't seem to find use of or documentation of a :blur selector. Is there one?There is no :blur pseudo-class in CSS.The dynamic pseudo-classes, like other pseudo-classes and in fact all other selectors, represent states; they do not represent events or transitions between states in terms of the document tree. To wit: the :focus pseudo-class represents an element that is in focus; it does not represent an element that has just received focus, nor does there exist a :blur pseudo-class to represent an element that has just lost focus.Similarly, this applies to the :hover pseudo-class. While it represents an element which has a pointing device over it, there is neither a :mouseover pseudo-class for an element that has just been pointed to nor a :mouseout pseudo-class for an element that has just been pointed away from.If you need to apply styles to an element that is not in focus, you have two choices:No, CSS has no blur pseudo-selector, presumably because blur is more of an event than a state. (It would be unclear when something should lose its blur state).All regular selectors are by default not focussed. So you don't need a special blur selector.These are the selectors by precedence.Use the general transition to set the blur transition."},

Therefore since the viewport isn't cutting it off, the overflow becomes irrelevant.ref: http://www.w3.org/wiki/CSS_absolute_and_fixed_positioning#Fixed_positioningYou could consider using CSS clip: rect(top, right, bottom, left); to clip a fixed positioned element to a parent. See demo at http://jsfiddle.net/lmeurs/jf3t0fmf/.Beware, use with care!Though the clip style is widely supported, main disadvantages are that:See http://tympanus.net/codrops/2013/01/16/understanding-the-css-clip-property/ for more info.EDIT: Chrome seems to handle positioning of and CSS3 transforms on child elements a lot better when applying backface-visibility, so just to be sure we added:to the main child element.Also note that it's not fully supported by older / mobile browsers or it might take some extra effort. See our implementation for the menu at bellafuchsia.com.EDIT 2014-11-02: Demo URL has been updated.2016 update:You can create a new stacking context, as seen on Coderwall: Which refers to http://dev.w3.org/csswg/css-transforms/#transform-renderingAs an alternative to using clip you could also use {border-radius: 0.0001px} on a parent element. It works not only with absolute/fixed positioned elements.If you want to hide overflow on fixed-position elements, the simplest approach I've found is to place the element inside a container element, and apply position:fixed and overflow:hidden to that element instead of the contained element (you must remove position:fixed from the contained element for this to work). The content of the fixed container should then be clipped as expected.In my case I was having trouble with using object-fit:cover on a fixed-position element (it was spilling outside the bounds of the page body, regardless of overflow:hidden). Placing it inside a fixed container with overflow:hidden on the container fixed the issue.I had a similar, quite complex problem with a fluid layout, where the right column had a fixed width and the left one had a flexible width. My fixed container should have the same width as the flexible column. Here is my solution:HTMLCSSLive Demo: http://jsfiddle.net/hWCub/Fixed position elements are positioned relative to the browser window, so the parent element is basically irrelevant.To get the effect you want, where the overflow on the parent clips the child, use position: absolute instead: http://jsfiddle.net/DBHUv/1/"},

Besides fill there is a bunch of other SVG attributes, which are also CSS properties. A list of them can be found in the SVG specification or on MDN.In order for a transition to work, both the start and the end value have to be defined in CSS. So, instead of defining the fill color via the fill attribute (fill=\"#FAFAFA\"), it needs to be defined either via the style attribute, which looks like this:or via a CSS rule packed in a <style> element within the SVG:In both cases you can then transition the values via the CSS rule you mentioned.Embedding the SVG within HTML has the advantage that you can do the styling from within the stylesheet you use for your HTML, so you can define styling that are shared between the HTML of your page and the embedded SVG."},

Is there any solution to this?I believe I have a solution that achieves what you're wanting:A background image (specifically a page background) offset by a number of pixels with respect to the center.This works using only HTML & CSS - no javascript required.This can now be easily achieved using background-position and calc as a CSS unit.The following CSS will achieve the same outcome as the previous solution (see \"Original Solution\" below):Note: Don't use this method if you require support for legacy versions of IE.What this does is moves the the entire container horizontally by the amount specified (in this case to the left 100px). Because the background image is centered relative to the container it moves to the left with the container.The padding fixes the 100px of blank space that would appear to the right of the container as a result of the move. Background images show through padding). Because browsers use the border-box value instead of the default content-box value to calculate background sizing and positioning, the background image is effectively moved back to the right 50px - half the distance of the padding. (Thanks to ErikE for clarification).So your offset/padding must be twice the required offset distance.I have prepared a sample page for you here: \nhttp://www.indieweb.co.nz/testing/background-offset-center.htmlHave a play with resizing the window. You will see that the purple and blue background image (laid over a deeper background image marking the center of the page) remains exactly 50px (half the offset/padding distance) to the left of the page center.Using background-position: center; is the same as background-position: 50% 50%;.So you can use calc to do some simple math in CSS as a replacement for any length value, for example:Will center the background image, but shift it 50 pixels to the left.So you want it centered by shifted 50 pixels to left. I would add the 50 pixels to the image in the form of a transparent space, unless you are dealing with absolute dimensions. There's no obvious CSS answer. You would either need to use JavaScript to calculate values or do something tricky. You can try keeping the background-position:25% center and adding position:relative;left:-50px or margin-left:-50px but those might not work depending on how you are using the DOM element.The only method I've found for this is to have the background inside another div, then use javascript to reposition ...if you know the width of the image you can use this:Note that you can't have it like that, i.e. you need to calculate (BgWidth - 50) and then write the number there.If you don't know the width you can use Javascript(with-or-without jQuery) and then use this:Nice answer Luke, one more thing, if your block width is larger than screen resolution, your must put your block in another container and do this:My answer gotta be too late but somehow I've found another solution.orThe examples have the same effect.the units need to be the same, so when specifying pixels for the x-position, the y-position needs to be also in pixels.example: EDIT: \nI just re-read your query and the only way to do that is either knowing the absolute position (assuming the outer elements aren't dynamic/flexible), or in case you don't know the position, maybe use javascript to set its position."},

You also need to move the overflow:hidden; to the cells tooHere's a Demo . Tested in Firefox 3.5.3 and IE 7 In general, if you are using white-space: nowrap; it is probably because you know which columns are going to contain content which wraps (or stretches the cell). For those columns, I generally wrap the cell's contents in a span with a specific class attribute and apply a specific width.Example:HTML:CSS:In most modern browsers, you can now specify:Then if you apply the styles from the posts above, as follows:The result gives you nicely hidden overflow throughout the table.

The initial file button (which isn't really a button but looks like one) is set with a CSS pseudo ::before element. These values can be overridden with CSS..2 - How to get the selected filename value, and update the input to show the value.Once a file is selected, the value can be obtained using JavaScript/jQuery.However, since the placeholder text for the input is a pseudo element, there's no easy way to manipulate this with Js/jQuery. You can however, have a another CSS class that hides the pseudo content once the file is selected... Use jQuery to toggle the .selected class on the .custom-file-control once the file is selected. This will hide the initial placeholder value. Then put the filename value in the .form-control-file span...You can then handle the file upload or re-selection as needed.Demo on Codeply (alpha 6)I just solved it this wayHtml:JS:Note: Thanks to ajax333221 for mentioning the .text-truncate class that will hide the overflow within label if the selected file name is too long.As of Bootstrap 4.3 you can change placeholder and button text inside the label tag:For changing the language of the file browser:\nAs an alternate to what ZimSystem mentioned (override the CSS), a more elegant solution is suggested by the bootstrap docs: build your custom bootstrap styles by adding languages in SCSS\nRead about it here: https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/components/forms/#file-browserNote: you need to have the lang attribute properly set in your document for this to workFor updating the value on file selection:\nYou could do it with inline js like this:Note: the .split('\\\\').slice(-1)[0] part removes the C:\\fakepath\\ prefixBootstrap 4More details are here https://learncodeweb.com/snippets/browse-button-in-bootstrap-4-with-select-image-preview/Today I need to create a browse button with multi-upload files option all above snippets are not good for me.The official Bootstrap example is also not working when I select multiple files.I come up with this code may be will help others in the future.The js code is given below.The working code example is given here with bootstrap 3 and bootstrap 4.3.1.https://codepen.io/mianzaid/pen/GeEbYVI just add this in my CSS file and it works:You can try below given snippet to display the selected file name from the file input type.Solution based on @Elnoor answer, but working with multiple file upload form input and without the \"fakepath hack\":HTML:JS:With the help of jquery, it can be done like this.\nCode:In case, if you need a no jquery solutionWithout JQueryHTML:JS:KliG"},

I want to start using v3 CSS grid syntax now.https://github.com/angular-ui/bootstrap/issues/331So, the http://angular-ui.github.io/bootstrap/ project does not depend on Bootstrap's JavaScript (it is not wrapping it, not requiring etc.). Those are native AngularJS directives written from the ground-up to be lightweight and well integrated into the AngularJS ecosystem.The only adherence to the Bootstrap project is Bootstrap's markup (HTML) and CSS.If you ask a question \"can I grab all the directives and use them with Bootstrap 3.0\" the answer is \"it depends\". It really depends if and how much Bootstrap 3.0 decide do change its markup and corresponding CSS classes. I would presume that markup of some controls have changed and not for some others.Now, the very good news with http://angular-ui.github.io/bootstrap/ is that most of the HTML markup and CSS classes are encapsulated in separate AngularJS templates. In practice it means that you can grab the JavaScript code of the directives and only change markup (templates) to fit into Bootstrap 3.0.All the templates are located here: \nhttps://github.com/angular-ui/bootstrap/tree/master/template\nand by browsing them you should get an idea that it is pretty simple to update markup without messing with JavaScript. This is one of the design goals of this project.I would encourage you to simply give it a try and see how CSS of Bootstrap 3.0 works with the existing directives and templates. If you spot any issues you can always update templates to Bootstrap 3.0 (and contribute them back to the project!)There's a pull request pending that contains fixes for most of the issues with Bootstrap 3.0 and the AngularUi directives:https://github.com/angular-ui/bootstrap/pull/742Just to give you an alternative: willing to integrate Angular JS and Boostrap 3 for mobile development I've tried to overcome the bootstrap.js integration in a different way.Instead to attempt to reproduce bootstrap.js behaviour exactly component by component, I basically made two general purpose directives communicating each other through events to sync the active/inactive state of two or more DOM nodes. Reflecting state trough classes makes them capable to reproduce almost all of the basic bootstrap.js components interaction.So for the most common applications you'll need only the bootstap 3 css and these few lines of js to get almost all of boostrap 3 functionalities. You can grab the code here, it will work outside the project and you can adapt it to fit your needs: https://github.com/mcasimir/mobile-angular-ui/blob/master/src/coffee/directives/toggle.coffee. It's Coffeescript but you can easily translate it to js through js2coffee.org.You may also want to read the docs here: http://mobileangularui.com/#toc6.This is a simple example to show the basics of how it works:And this is how you can use them to create Tabs component:As a plus you can also control the same tabs from different nodes:Don't know if this can fit your needs but this way you can create at least: tabs, accordions, collapsibles, modals and dropdowns without the need of a dedicated library. Also note that it will work either with bootstrap 2 and 3 since it not depends on bootstrap markup at all."},

I'm not sure what the purpose of the  colored numbers is, but using color to display information leaves colorblind users out of the loop and is a big no no for accessibility.too bad you can't edit the html... how about js? if not, maybe a good-enough solution would behtml:css:It's a bit late for this but I want to share it with the community, took me a long while to do this. I found a solution to change the OL numbers background and color that works on every browser. Requires an extra tag inside the li.See it hereThis is easy, as long as you don't want to assign different colours to different list item numbers. No HTML modifications necessary. Might not work in 100% of browsers though.."},

The page is still jumpy.  :/  If I disable all CSS, it runs great.  I need a tool that can profile the page and report where the CSS bottlenecks are.So, I finally got around to writing a JavaScript function that indexed all of my CSS classes on the page and then individually toggled them, while scrolling the page.  This immediately pin-pointed the errant class, and from there, I was able to determine errant property.  Turns out that border-radius on an element that contains many children (e.g. a body level div) performs incredibly poorly on IE9.I've started a github repo for my CSS stress test: https://github.com/andyedinborough/stress-cssFrom there, you can install a bookmarklet to easily run the test on any page.The Page Speed plugin from Google has a section that analyses your CSS and tells you about inefficient selectors, perhaps start there?hthNote: I know its a Firefox plugin, but should help optimize a bit :)Hmm, never heard of such a tool. If you find none, things to look out for manually will includeI would strongly suspect the first point - alpha transparencies can be a terrible rendering bottleneck, especially on older systems.I also have performance problems on a web project I'm currently working on. It runs well in Firefox, Chrome, even IE8. In IE9 it bogs down.After some detective work I discovered that eliminating all box-shadow CSS lines improved performance considerably. I had shadows from banners, tables, boxes and tabs, each with just a subtle amount of shadow and blur, but apparently enough for IE9 to get all moody.The Chrome dev tools used to contain a CSS Selector Profiler for doing just this sort of thing. You can see screen shots of it in this blog post.The Chrome team pulled the feature in Chrome 30 stating that:You could try to use an old version of Chrome to dig into the issue, but I'd recommend taking a look at the Timeline tab of the current version of Chrome dev tools with will show you how long Chrome has taken to calculate styles (where selector performance is affected), layout and paint the page.Opera is experimenting with css profiling in its profiler.It can be enabled following the steps on this page.\nThen open the profiler, start profiling, and refresh the page you wish to analyze.\nStop profiling after rendering finishes, then the results will be shown."},

The border will always be as tall as the element.You can achieve the same effect by wrapping the contents of the cell in a <span>, and applying height/border styles to that. Or by drawing a short vertical line in an 1 pixel wide PNG which is the correct height, and applying it as a background to the cell:I have another possibility. This is of course a \"newer\" technique, but for my projects works sufficient.It only works if you need one or two borders. I've never done it with 4 borders... and to be honest, I don't know the answer for that yet.I hope this helps you too, as for me, this is an easy workaround.Yes, you can set the line height after defining the border like this:For td elements line-height will successfully allow you to resize the border-height as SPrince mentioned. For other elements such as list items, you can control the border height with line-height and the height of the actual element with margin-top and margin-bottom. Here is a working example of both:\nhttp://jsfiddle.net/byronj/gLcqu6mg/An example with list items:No, you cannot set the border height. Then with your code you can:Hope that helps!Currently, no, not without resorting to trickery. borders on elements are supposed to run the entire length of whatever side of the element box they apply to.//draws a line on right side of the box.\nlater add a margin-top and margin-bottom.\ni.e.,This might help in drawing a line on the right-side of the box with a gap on top and bottom.Mods:Good Luck...This will add a centered border to the left of the cell that is 80% the height of the cell. You can reference the full border-image documentation here.Just like everyone else said, you can't control border height. \nBut there are workarounds, here's what I do:You can set height to inherit for the height of the table or calc(inherit - 2px) for a 2px smaller border.\nRemember, inherit has no effect when the table height isn't set.Use height: 50% for half a border.DemoJust you add height under the border property."},

(you'll have to re-run the code to reset it)I don't know quite how to remedy this one...Any ideas? Just move the entire modal outside of the rest of your code, to the very bottom. It doesn't need to be nested in any other element, other than the body.DemoThey hint at this solution in the documentation.Although the z-index of the .modal is higher than that of the .modal-backdrop, that .modal is in a parent div #content-wrap which has a lower z-index than .modal-backdrop (z-index: 1002 vs z-index: 1030).Because the parent has lower z-index than the .modal-backdrop everything in it will be behind the modal, irrespective of any z-index given to the children.If you remove the z-index you have set on both the body div#fullContainer #content-wrap and also on the #ctrlNavPanel, everything seems to work ok.NOTE:  I think that you may have initially used z-indexes on the #content-wrap and #ctrlNavPanel to ensure the nav sits behind, but that's not necessary because the nav element comes before the content-wrap in the HTML, so you only need to position them, not explicitly set a stacking order.EDIT\nAs Schmalzy picked up on, the links are no longer clickable.  This is because the full-container is 100% wide and so covers the navigation.  The quickest way to fix this is to place the navigation inside that div:DEMO HEREIn my case, I could fix it by adding css for the .modal-backdropAlthough this works, form controls still seem to appear above the backdrop, clicking anywhere dismisses the modal, but it doesn't look great.A better workaround for me is to bind to the shown event (once the page is loaded) and to correct the z-index property.In this case, if you are OK with changing the DOM on modal shown:None of the answers worked well enough for me.\nThe problem appeared to lie where the modal windows needs to be outside of the body.and it is not bestSo this code done the job just prefectly:I'm wary of moving the modal content outside its original context: other JS or styles might depend on that context.However, I doubt there are any scripts or styles that require a specific context for the backdrop. So my solution is to move the backdrop adjacent to the modal content, forcing it into the same stacking context:It's only a slight deviation from jacoswarts' solution, so thanks for the inspiration!I was fighting with the same problem some days... I found three posible solutions, but i dont know, which is the most optimal, if somebody tell me, i will be grateful.the modifications will be in bootstrap.cssOption 1: Option 2:Option 3:I used the option 2.In my case one of parents of my modal was animated and had thisThe blocker here is animation-fill-mode: both;. I could not just move modal outside, so the solution was to override 'animation-fill-mode' to animation-fill-mode: none;. Animation still worked fine.Try remove the backdrop, if you don't realy need it (data-backdrop= \"false\"):Another resolution for this problem is to add z-index: 0; to .modal-backdrop class in your bootstrap-dialog.css file if you don't want to modify bootstrap.css.if we cannot delete backdrop and/or we have component framework such angular or vue we cannot move modal to the root. i did this trick: put my custom modal-backdrop container(with aditional class) as sibling for modal-dialog  container and added some cssand cssYou could use this : For those using ASP.NET MVC,Needing to move the modal div just before the </body> tag but can't do it because you are using a Layout pageDefine a section in you _Layout.cshtml file just before the body tag, eg:Then in your viewThis way, the modal HTML will be rendered before the body tag and the modal now should be displayed correctly..just remove z-index: 1040; from this file bootstrap.css class .modal-backdropI was missing the follow html <div class=\"modal fade\" tabindex=\"-1\" role=\"dialog\" aria-labelledby=\"myModalLabel\">added it and worked without problemsSince I don't have the chance to move the modal markup since i added it in a partial template within a conditional what worked for me is add CSS bellowThen, when boostrap add class \"in\" through js apply display: block and everything works fine.I Found that applying ionic framework (ionic.min.cs) after bootstrap coursing this issue for me.If you can't put the modal to the root (if your use angular and the modal is in a controller for example), modifying bootstrap or using js is obviously a bad solution.so saying you have your website structure:open your code inspector and move the modal to the root, it should be working (but no where you want):now put it in the first div and check if it's working: if yes check the next child until it's not working and find the div that is the problem;Once you know which div is the problem you can play with the css display and position to make it work.everyone has a different structure but in my case setting a parent to display: table; was the solutionPut this code wherever you wantMany times , you cannot move the modal outside as this affects your design structure.The reason the backdrop comes above your modal is id the parent has any position set. A very simple way to solve the problem other then moving your modal outside is move the backdrop inside structure were you have your modal. In your case, it could beNote that this solution is applicable if you have a definite strucure for your application and you cant just move the modal outside as it will go against the design structurejust move your modal outside of all div contents, place it mostly prior to closing of body.First make sure the modal is not in any parent div.\nThen add \n$('#myModal').appendTo(\"body\")It worked fine for me.In Addition to all answers here, i found out, that the bootstrap4 \"animated fadeIn\" is also causing this error (not clickable modal behind background):check if your modal is in the following parent tag (bootstrap animation)<div class=\"animated fadeIn\"></div>I removed this tag - solved the problem for me.If you use JQuery, you can use the appendTo() to append the modal to a specific element, in this case, the , in most case, a simple one line can move your modal on top of the backdrop regardless where your modal div's positionhere's the reference of the JQuery appendTo function:\nhttp://api.jquery.com/appendto/I updated it to your fiddle\nhttp://jsfiddle.net/ZBQ8U/240/this works for me.i encountred this problem, and after investigating my css, the main container (direct child of the body) had: the backdrop worked well after i removed those two properties. You may also encounter this problem if the main wraper have a position: fixedI had a similar problem  that the fade was not working and the overlay stayed on the page.\nI had dynamic content added back to the page (refresh on some content only on modal action).\nI also had this $('#rejectModal-'+itemId).modal('hide') (itemId is dynamic id for multiple modals in a single page for rejecting some information) but the problem was still not gone.The overlay was staying because my layout was not set to null in the partial view\nAfter setting this the problem was gone:Just remove the backdrop, insert this code in your css file"},

Next is the jQuery plugins section, again start by selecting Toggle All to turn everything off and then just select two plugins:That's all you'll need, js (bootstrap.min.js) and css (only bootstrap.css which you'll need to modify a bit, explained below).  Go to the bottom of that page and select compile and download to grab your package.One final thing to note.  As @Rrrrrrrrrk mentioned, \"I found it still added a lot of normalization to the start of the css, but could safely delete it (from html to img, keeping the css from .img-responsive onwards).\"  This is still valid.  I also added the following css to force a few styles into the Modals:This just ensures fonts are similar to the original modal styling and don't take on your pages styles (could probably be tweaked a bit more). One final item to note, you could minify the css at this point by running it through http://cssminifier.com/.  Saves a few KB.Implementing the Modal:I might as well just finish this off.  I'm using a cookie plugin because I want to give my users an option to hide the message for 14 days, which is set in the code.  Here are the code blocks you'll need:This should go in the <head> of you document, probably after any of your css, so even just before the ending </head> tag will work.This should go within your <body>.  This will create the modal and the css you've included will hide it.This code should go just before the ending </body> tag.  It loads jQuery, bootstrap, and the cookie plugin I need.Finally, you'll want to add this script after the plugins above.  This is a bit customized to my situation, I'm only launching the modal if there is no cookie set, and if the modal launches created a function to click Don't Show Again which creates the cookie to disable the launch of the modal.Hope this helps!  Good luck.Go to the Bootstrap customize section and select just the modal option in the components section. Download the file, open the bootstrap.css file and copy the entire contents into your own CSS file.If you try to work out which specific parts you need you'll likely miss something important, and besides, the modal css on its own is not too big.Update:\nThe link is now here.

However html markup, when rendered for visualization uses a different way to code line breaks. There are very good reasons for that. So what you have to do is \"translate\" the existing line breaks into html style line breaks. How to do that depends on the environment you are working under. In general you have to translate line break codes like \\n to <br> tags. The php scripting language offers a function for this for example: nl2br()However take care: this only applies when rendering the text as html markup. This does not apply, when you output the text into a textarea inside a form again to allow changing it for example. In that case you have to preserve the original line breaks just as received. So what you typically do is: you save the unaltered text input as received. When outputting that text again to a client, say after reading it from a database where you have saved it before, then you know the situation, how the text will be presented. That is when you either translate or leave the existing line breaks as they are. You could also encode unaltered text containing line breaks by <pre>...</pre> tags, so mark them as to be rendered as preformatted. THis is for example done when displaying source code in html pages. You can do:You keep output in textarea as it is. You would receive input as a string output that string(write to file) that string adding textarea to the input string."},

It's safer to leave the semi-colons in.Most definitely, for every block, you'd save a couple of bytes. These add up, especially for large style sheets. Instead of worrying about these performance gains yourself, it's better to use a CSS compressor, such as the YUI Compressor to automatically remove the ending semi-colons for you.No, it's safe, as browsers implement this part of the specification correctly. The CSS2 specification defines a declaration thusly:More importantly:This means that ; is used to separate multiple declarations, but it is not needed to terminate them.JavaScript is a whole different beast with a completely different specification. This particular question has been answered in depth many times before on Stack Overflow.In my opinion, no. If you add a rule below the last rule, it's easy to forget to add the semicolon.Can't imagine that it would make much of a difference in load time.No, semicolons are only required to separate rules in CSS blocks. Semicolons are delimiters, not terminators.Yes, don't leave it up the the JavaScript interpreter to add semicolons.It will improve the loading time ever so slightly. With a large enough CSS file(s), it can even be noticeable (well, minification overall can be; I doubt just removing the final semicolon will ever be enough).If you care that much about the loading times, however, you should be using a program to minify your CSS, not manually attempting to do it. Minified CSS is (all but) impossible to read. It's a bad practice to use this in the \"source code\" so to speak, because it's all too easy to forget it.This is a duplicate question.  See here:Semicolon in CSSRegarding applying a semi-colon in JavaScript, functions should not end with semicolons unless they are assigned declaratively, viz. var a = function() {};  However, browsers perform automatic semi-colon insertion if you inadvertently (or purposely) leave them out.Removing declaration stops will not \"break\" the browsers but should still be left for automated minifiers (especially if you're concerned with loading times - semicolons alone would not add up to much) but should be avoided in the source for maintainability reasons.If you are looking for best practices, CSS formatting rules in the Google css styleguide is a very good place to start - not to blindly apply their suggestion but to see their reasoning behind it.Javascript is a different story though - the short answer is always use semicolons, never rely on implicit insertion, but I've never seen an answer better and more thorough than as prescribed by Google in yet another styleguide of theirs:I'd shy away from it as a smart minification process will handle this for you and it'd introduce errors if you forgot to place the semi-colon when adding new definitions.Yes, smaller file size. Though, the difference is negligible and minification processes will automatically do this.NoNo, it'd be \"invalid\" to exclude semi-colons at the end of a function statement.Based on my experience, 1) It is not good practice 2) Even on a very large scale load times will be insignificant. 3) Not aware of any browser that would break from this. 4) Same true for jQueryFor CSS, I tried this out on IE9, FF, GC, Safari, and Opera, and it didn't make a difference.As for Javascript, I got an error on FF and GC, so I would say don't do this on scripts. As for load time, the difference will not be in any way noticeable."},

The height and width attributes on the iframe element seem to have no effect, strangely. Surrounding it with a div manages to constrain it, but then I'm unable to scroll within the iframe.Has anyone tackled iframes in mobile safari before? Any ideas where to start?Yeah, you can't constrain the iframe itself with height and width.  You should put a div around it.  If you control the content in the iframe, you can put some JS within the iframe content that will tell the parent to scroll the div when the touch event is received.  like this:The JS:The HTML:If you don't control the iframe content, you can use an overlay over the iframe in a similar manner, but then you can't interact with the iframe contents other than to scroll it - so you can't, for example, click links in the iframe.It used to be that you could use two fingers to scroll within an iframe, but that doesn't work anymore.Update: iOS 6 broke this solution for us. I've been attempting to get a new fix for it, but nothing has worked yet.  In addition, it is no longer possible to debug javascript on the device since they introduced Remote Web Inspector, which requires a Mac to use.If the iFrame content is not yours then the solution below will not work.With Android all you need to do is to surround the iframe with a DIV and set the height on the div to document.documentElement.clientHeight.  IOS, however, is a different animal.  Although I have not yet tried Sharon's solution it does seem like a good solution.  I did find a simpler solution but it only works with IOS 5.+.Surround your iframe element with a DIV (lets call it scroller), set the height of the DIV and make sure that the new DIV has the following styling:This alone will work but you will notice that in most implementations the content in the iframe goes blank when scrolling and is basically rendered useless. My understanding is that this behavior has been reported as a bug to Apple as early as iOS 5.0. To get around that problem, find the body element in the iframe and add -webkit-transform', 'translate3d(0, 0, 0) like so:If your app or iframe is heavy on memory usage you might get a hitchy scroll for which you might need to use Sharon's solution.This only works if you control both the outside page and the iframe page.On the outside page, make the iframe unscrollable.On the iframe page, add this.This works because modern browsers uses html to determine the height, so we just give that a fixed height and turn the body into a scrollable node.I have put @Sharon's code together into the following, which works for me on the iPad with two-finger scrolling. The only thing you should have to change to get it working is the src attribute on the iframe (I used a PDF document).I'm building my first site and this helped me get this working for all sites that I use iframe embededding for. Thanks!Sharon's method worked for me, however when a link in the iframe is followed and then the browser back button is pressed, the cached version of the page is loaded and the iframe is no longer scrollable.  To overcome this I used some code to refresh the page as follows:I implemented the following and it works well.  Basically, I set the body dimensions according to the size of the iFrame content.  It does mean that our non-iFrame menu can be scrolled off the screen, but otherwise, this makes our sites functional with iPad and iPhone.  \"workbox\" is the ID of our iFrame.Purely using MSchimpf and Ahmad's code, I made adjustments so I could have the iframe within a div, therefore keeping a header and footer for back button and branding on my page. Updated code:and the htmlDon't scroll the IFrame page or its content, scroll the parent page. If you control the IFrame content, you can use the iframe-resizer library to turn the iframe element itself into a proper block level element, with a natural/correct/native height. Also, don't attempt to position (fixed, absolute) your iframe in the parent page, or present an iframe in a modal window, especially if it has form elements.I also suspect that iOS Safari has a non-standards behavior that expands your iframe's height to its natural height, much like the iframe-resizer library will do for desktop browsers, which seem to render responsive iframe content at height 0px or 150px or some other not useful default. If you need to contrain width, try a max-width style inside the iframe.The solution is to use Scrolling=\"no\" on the iframe.That's it."},

You can then easily style it to your needs.  The benefit of this over using a data-* attribute is that aria-label will be read off by screen readers as a \"label\" for the list, which is semantically correct for your intended use of this data.Note: IE8 supports :before attributes, but must use the single colon version (and must have a valid doctype defined).  IE7 does not support :before, but Modernizer or Selectivizr should fix that issue for you.  All modern browsers support the older :before syntax, but prefer that the ::before syntax be used.  Generally the best way to handle this is to have an external stylesheet for IE7/8 that uses the old format and a general stylesheet using the new format, but in practice, most just use the old single colon format since it is still 100% cross browser, even if not technically valid for CSS3.Always use heading tags for headings. The clue is in the name :)If you don’t want them to be bold, change their style with CSS. For example:In HTML5, you can associate the heading and the list more clearly by using the <section> element. (<section> doesn’t work properly in IE 8 and earlier without some JavaScript though.)You could do something similar in HTML 4:Then style thus:I like to make use of the css :before and a data-* attribute for the listHTML:CSS:This will make a list with the header on it that is whatever text is specified as the list's data-header attribute. You can then easily style it to your needs.how about making the heading a list-element with different styles like soand the CSSadditionally, use a reset CSS to set margins and paddings right on the ul and li. here's a good reset CSS. once you've reset the margins and paddings, you can apply some margin on the list-elements other than the one's with the heading class, to indent them.Would the use of <caption> be allowed?h3 is absolutly a better solution than h2, h1 or h6 !Therefore, using Hn is probably one of the best solution, but surely not a specific level."},

CSSHTMLCan anyone help me out with this issue that has been bugging me forever?If you want the #header to be the same width as your container, with 10px of padding, you can leave out its width declaration.  That will cause it to implicitly take up its entire parent's width (since a div is by default a block level element).  Then, since you haven't defined a width on it, the 10px of padding will be properly applied inside the element, rather than adding to its width:You can see it in action here.  The key when using percentage widths and pixel padding/margins is not to define them on the same element (if you want to accurately control the size).  Apply the percentage width to the parent and then the pixel padding/margin to a display: block child with no width set.UpdateAnother option for dealing with this is to use the box-sizing CSS rule:Here's a post talking about how box-sizing works.You can also use the CSS calc() function to subtract the width of your padding from the percentage of your container's width.An example:Just be sure to make the subtracted width equal to the total padding, not just one half. If you pad both sides of the inner div with 16px, then you should subtract 32px from the final width, assuming that the example below is what you want to achieve.Try removing the position from header and add overflow to container:"},

To make this work with client side validation we cant rely on checking the ModelState since that assumes a postback has occurred.

It works on Chrome on Android even when keyboard drawer is active. If someone wants to test iPhone that would be cool:Here is the magic. Treat html like a wrapper with a ratio enforced height relative to the actual viewport. You know the classic responsive tag <meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1\">? This is why the vh is used. Also, on the surface it would seem like body should get these rules, and it may look ok...until a change of height like when the keyboard opens up.For Safari versions <5.1 the css3 property background-size doesn't work. In such cases you need webkit.So you need to use -webkit-background-size attribute to specify the background-size.Hence use -webkit-background-size:cover.Reference-Safari versions using webkitI found the following on Stephen Gilbert's website - http://stephen.io/mediaqueries/. It includes additional devices and their orientations.

You can also find some smooth-but-blurry-by-design fonts at Google Fonts, however.There are some new CSS3 techniques for font rendering and text effects though the consistency, performance, and reliability of these techniques vary so largely to the point where you generally shouldn't rely on them too much.Works the best.

The margin doesn't specify an area around an element, but rather the minimum distance between elements.As the green container doesn't have any border or padding, there is nothing to contain the margin of the orange element. The margin is used between the top element and the orange element just as if the green container would have the margin.Use a padding in the green container instead of a margin on the orange element.Use padding instead of margin:Not sure if this will work in your case, but I just solved this with the following CSS properties#element was being pushed down because it's first child element had a margin-top: 30px. With this CSS, it now works as expected :) Not sure if it'll work for every case, YMMV.You can either add padding-top: 30 on the green box, use relative positioning on the orange box with top: 30px, or float the orange box and use the same margin-top: 30px.You read this document:\nBox model - Margin collapsingCSSNot sure how hackish this sounds, but how about adding a transparent border?"},

For example, Bootstrap is around 120k. Note the Google link you shared specifies the following (emphasis mine):So a single page load may be faster but overall it's likely to be slower. Personally I would stay away from doing that. However, one thing you can do is bundle all of your CSS into a single request (you are using MVC so that is relatively simple) so you only have to do a single extra trip to the server for your CSS and all future pages requested by the browser will not need to ask for them again.No one has mentioned the intended use case for this technique, which is definitely not to load 100% of your css.  Rather, this technique is meant to make users think the page has loaded faster.When we discuss making pages load faster, the real goal is generally to make the page load seem faster.  From the perspective of the user experience, this is much more important than actually making the load take less time.  It doesn't matter if the whole page take 500ms to load, because a human can't parse it that quickly anyway.  What matters is how quickly the page appears to have loaded.So the appropriate usage of this technique is to load, immediately, the absolutely essential css to make the page render properly.  That is, there are some css rules that make the images be the right size, that make things float correctly, that avoid that horrible appearance of page content jumping around the page while the facebook SDK finishes its business.  That code needs to be present in the same instant the markup is loaded.  Solution: inline that critical css.But definitely DO NOT inline all of the css.  There can be another 100kb that loads later, if that css only styles content that is loading asynchronously anyway.  But if there is page structure that must be in the correct form after 25ms, that css should be inlined.You misunderstood the PageSpeed suggestion. The recommendation is for small CSS files:In fact, the article later suggests a balanced approach for large CSS files: inline critical CSS and defer-load the remaining CSS file.Now, even if PageSpeed gives you a decent score after inlining large CSS files* it might still be a bad idea:Inline CSS files means you duplicate the <style>...</style> tag across pages. This means you serve redundant data for subsequent or repeat page views. The redundant data costs bandwidth and increases download time.Separate CSS file along with strong caching headers allow you to eliminate redundancy. Caching headers instruct the browsers to cache the CSS file on first page view and reuse on subsequent or repeat page views.Inline CSS files reduce the proportion of \"actual\" content on the page. Inline CSS files require you to insert the CSS above the content while most of us strive to put the actual content near the top HTML. Inline CSS will also cause the browser to download additional bytes before allowing it to download other resources such as JavaScript and images.If your HTML page is generated dynamically then, most likely, it will be served uncompressed. Some servers (e.g. IIS) and software (e.g. Wordpress) allow compression of dynamic content but requires more CPU + Memory compared to compression of static content (e.g. CSS files). This is yet another reason why you should keep CSS in separate file.For the above reasons I would keep my CSS combined, minified, compressed and cached, in a separate file, even for one page websites.* Not to be confused with inline stylesThis is too long to fit in a comment. There where I work, we use Content Security Policy header directives (specifically style-src) to explicitly prohibit the use of inline CSS. The rationale not to use inline CSS in this case is minimizing the risks of CSS injection for pages created dynamically. OWASP has detailed information about this topic, including exploit samples: https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Testing_for_CSS_Injection_(OTG-CLIENT-005). If only static content is served to the browser, there should be no risk."},

However, the content goes behind the menu.  I have set clear: both; and this has not helped.What you need is an extra spacing div (as far as I understood your question).This div will be placed between the menu and content and be the same height as the menu div, paddings included.HTMLCSSSee my example here.This works by offsetting the space that would have been occupied by the nav div, but as it has position: fixed; it has been taken out of the document flow.The preferred method of achieving this effect is by using margin-top: 95px;/*your nav height*/ on your content wrapper.Having just struggled with this and disliking some of the \"hackier\" solutions, I found this to be useful and clean:If your menu height is variable (for responsiveness or because it's loaded dynamically), you can set the top margin to where the fixed div ends. For example:CSSJavascriptHTMLHere's a fiddle (https://jsfiddle.net/632k9xkv/5/) that goes a little beyond this with both a fixed nav menu and header in an attempt to hopefully make this a useful sample.I just had this problem, and this was my solution:Adjust for the height of your floatingMenu. If you don't know for sure that it's a div following then you can use * rather than div.  This is all valid CSS2.I liked grdevphl's Javascript answer best, but in my own use case, I found that using height() in the calculation still left a little overlap since it didn't take padding into account. If you run into the same issue, try outerHeight() instead to compensate for padding and border.Wrap the menu contents with another div:And the CSS:And about your page below the menu, you can give it a padding-top as well:I just added a padding-top to the div below the nav. Hope it helps. I'm new on this. C:To those suggesting the use of margin-top or padding-top to move the main division below the fixed menu - you don't seem to be testing it completely.If you set a margin or padding, it will scroll with the page and you will lose lines - go try this pageLooks good, does it not? Highlight a word on the bottom visible line and press page-down - the line with the highlighted word, and a few other lines, will be scrolled under the fixed division.Margin-top or padding-top WILL position the main division below the fixed division but it all falls flat on its face when you page-down or click the scroll bar to scroll one viewport height of the page.Same problem if you page-up, lines \"fall off\" the bottom of the view-port.Does anyone have an actual fix for THIS problem?I know how to position things - that's fairly easy if you know the basics about margins, padding, etc. - but how do you prevent the loss of lines when scrolling?I've looked at a lot of examples of what are claimed to be a properly functioning pages with fixed divisions at the top, but they don't work! They all have problems which scrolling.I have come across some pages appear to work but if the fixed division is made higher, lines will be lost. I believe I know why they appear to work.Think in terms of how text on a totally normal (no fancy formatting) page scrolls. Do you see the bottom line when you scroll up or do you see the next line - the bottom one having scrolled off the top of the viewport?Answer - you see the bottom line scrolled to become the top line.The fixed menu pages that seem to work really don't. Scroll them and the bottom line is scrolled off the viewport but since the next line is visible, it appears that the fixed division works - but we know better, don't we?If the fixed division gets higher than the height of one line of text, they fail and lines are lost.The only pages that I've seen that actually work properly are on sites such as yahoo and I don't have the time, nor inclination, to dig down into what is a lot of CSS, HTML, and JavaScript on the pages to get to the heart of the matter.So - go to that page and see if you can make changes (\"inspect\" the elements and make changes to the CSS rules) that fix the scrolling problems.If you can, come back and share your discovery with world.My page is a good place to look at what it takes to be able to fix a division at the top, center it (and the main division) and restrict it to a max-width. It may help some of you but I'm sorry I don't have a fix for the scrolling problemPlay with the height of the fix division - make it short enough so that only one line shows and then play with the scrolling. Then make it large enough for two lines and then three and play with the scrolling. You'll see the issues.Here is a page that is supposed to work but it doesn't - read the very last comment - they describe the problem in a different way but it is the same problemI just tested the page again in Chrome and it seems to work fairly satisfactorily.

I am really new at html and css and this question may be dumb but plz help me. Thanks in advance.Short answer is that you need to change the z-index so that #firstdiv is considered on top of the other divs.I messed with my css for hours, changing the positioning and z-index of just about every element on the page.  I deleted every other element from the DOM except for the one with the cursor: pointer on hover, and it STILL didn't work.For me, on Mac OSX El Captain V 10.11, the issue had to do with some sort of interference with Photoshop CC.  Once I closed photoshop, the cursor started working again.Solution for me: Close and reopen photoshopcursor:pointer doesn't work when you're using Chrome's mobile emulator.Just happened to me, and in my case it was due to a CSS rule pointer-events: none; which was set on a parent element and I forgot about it.This caused any pointer events to be just ignored, which includes the cursor.To fix this, you can just set the style to allow pointer events:Or directly in the element:Also add cursor:hand. Some browsers need that instead.It works if you remove position:fixed from #firstdiv - but @Sj is probably right as well - most likely a z-index layering issue.I had this issue using Angular and SCSS. I had all my CSS nested so I decided to remove cursor: pointer; out of it. And it worked.Example:I have the same issue, when I close the chrome window popup browser inspector its working fine for me.The problem in my case was that the :after blocked mouse events, so I had to add pointer-events: none; to my :after block.worked for me.Position the element as relative and then use z-index, it worked for me :)"},

Is this osbervable in all browsers; also, is it a bug, or intentional behaviour?So far I've not found anything on this topic on the internet, just 'fixed position makes it stick to the page'.The fixing and the positioning are two separate things. They're positioned the same as absolutely positioned elements: relative to their containing block. But in contrast with absolutely positioned elements, they remain fixed to that position with respect to the viewport (i.e. they don't move when scrolling):http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/visuren.html#propdef-positionThe definition of containing block says:andwhich suggests that while their positioning algorithm is the same (they're both positioned relative to their containing block), the containing block for fixed elements is always the viewport, in contrast with absolutely positioned elements, so they should be positioned relative to that and not to any absolutely or fixed-positioned elements.And as a matter of fact, that is indeed the case. For example, if you add top: 20px to .fixed, both divs will be positioned 20 pixels from the top of the viewport. The nested fixed div does not get positioned 20 pixels down from the top of its parent.The reason you're not seeing that in this case is because you're not actually setting any of the left/top/right/bottom properties, so their positions are determined by the position they would have in the flow (their \"static position\"), which as my first quote said, is done according to the absolute model.I don't think this is really the intent. Things with fixed positioning are all positioned in relation to the window, if you have a fixed a child of another fixed, what do you want to happen? You can easily duplicate the behavior by not just position both of the fixed elements separately, or using other position to alter the child's position within the fixed element. :DI dont think there is anything more to this then what w3c say there is:So if you get rid of that \"padding: 40px;\" you will get 2 elements - 1 over another.Same effect like if you positioned both elements absolutely to top:0 left:0 with same parent(body).Short Answer:if you have a scrollable element with fixed position (a modal for example), and you want to make one of the childs fixed also(modal close button for example), here is the solution: you can make your element non-scrollable, and instead create a child inside of it and make it scrollable(modal content for example). this way , you can apply position: absolute to the child you want it to be fixed (modal close button for example), instead of position: fixed.Long Answer:In my case, i had a display: fixed Modal and applied the overflow: auto to it to make it scrollable. then i wanted to make the close button display: fixed.Nesting display: fixed worked on chrome, but not in Firefox. so i changed my structure, i removed the overflow: auto from Modal to make it non-scrollable, and instead made the modal content scrollable. and also added position: absolute to close button."},

This sort of feels wrong because I am drifting in the direction of writing my own layout manager in javascript just to get this effect.The problem I noticed is that when element scales, browser change its pixels ratio, not pixels amount. Element is smaller but it doesn't change its actual pixel size in DOM. Because of that I don't think that CSS-only solution exist.I put scalable element into container which keeps the same pixel ratio as rest of elements. Using Java Script I simply change container's size. Everything is still based on CSS3 transform: scale. Maybe JS code could be simplier, but now it's all about the idea (just a proof of concept);) Fiddle with two examples: http://jsfiddle.net/qA5Tb/9/HTML:CSS:JS:I finally figured out a simple solution and it is much similar than where I started from. I will admit, it took many attempts to figure this out (over the last year or so) to finally figure it out. I was actually looking for an answer to this question. I have had problems with this before. Anyways, I started working this out again and I did find a simple solution. Anyways, the trick was to use the margin bottom together with the CSS calc script. Also, you must have to have absolute height declared for the the object (div). I dont think this will work with if the div can expand, otherwise, after many attempts and hours on this I finally have a very simple, clean, working solution. So, for example, height = 300px (not 30%, or no height). I would even set overflow-y = hidden if you can. If you want the div to grow (not have an absolute height), I believe you will need JavaScript. I did not try it. Otherwise this is working correctly in all tests. I am sure this will work nice with SASS or LESS since you could declare some of the repeated things using variables in the CSS. I have not tried that yet.Some important comments on my solution:I have also have set up a Codepen to test this with and for sharing.https://codepen.io/cyansmiles/details/yvGaVPI had to tweak my code a little from above.It now works on all sides (not just up and down). I see a little edit, I think that is CSS issue (you could add another pixel to code to resolve this).Here is the working Codepen link. Feel free to let me know if you use it.

How to generate a new color which is either lighter or darker given in percent  (ie. 20% darker) in PHP?Adjusting colour by percent, as in the example given by Frxstrem, is not ideal.If your colour is black (0,0,0 in RGB), you will be multiplying by zero, which will not yield any change at all. If your colour is dark gray (for instance 2,2,2 in RGB), you will have to lighten by 50% to just move up to (3,3,3). On the other hand, if you have an RGB colour of (100,100,100), the adjustment of 50% will move you up to (150,150,150), which is a much bigger change in comparison.A much better solution would be to adjust by step/number (0-255) instead of by percent, for instance like this (PHP code):Edit 2014-01-06: Cleaned up the code a bit.The answers are wrong.Using RGB model is a conceptual error.You need to transform the color from RGB (or Hex form) into HSL.That is Hue, Saturation, Lightness.Once you convert it from RGB into HSL, to lighten up the color you simply adjust the L value (lightness) by 10%. Then once you are done you convert back from HSL to RGB and you are done.Voila!RGB to HSV in PHPHere's an example:Extract the colors. I'd prefer to use regular expressions, though there are probably other more efficient ways too.Now we have red in $parts[1], green in $parts[2] and blue in $parts[3]. Now, let's convert them from hexadecimal to integers:Then we'll decrease them by 20 %:Now, we'll turn them back into hexadecimal and add them to our output stringThen just add a \"#\" to the beginning of the string, and that's it!Torkil Johnsen's answer is based on fixed step which doesn't manipulate only brightness but also slightly changes the hue. Frxstrem's method has flaws too as Torkil Johnsen noted.I've taken this approach from a Github comment and improved the code. It works perfectly for any case.Here is an example result:I was interested in this, but my question was how do I add a opacity to a colour?I wanted a colour to fade, not made lighter.  i found this: \nhttp://www.gidnetwork.com/b-135.html\nand it worked great- code posted from original site for SO readers.https://github.com/mikeemoo/ColorJizz-PHP allows to convert to HSL, change lightness component and convert back to RGB.If you want a simple implementation and you don't care that much about the values being specifically above 50% lightness (or whatever your threshold), you can use my solution for lighter colors:The idea is to generate a random color in the higher part of the palette. You can adjust the results to be more or less dark by changing the \"1.5\" value:You can do the same for darker colors by setting the starting point of the random function to \"0x000000\" and dividing the end limit:I know this is not a precise but it works for me."},

Because of this you need to add d-flex flex-column to the card-body. This will make the flexbox alignment classes work.Another option is to use mt-auto (auto top margin) on the button which will push it to the bottom of the Card.Set the .card-body div to display:flex and flex-direction:column.Then give the button margin-top:auto.I imagine there are Bootstrap help classes for this.You have to add:Something like this will work the magic:Use the footer, it already has everything setup for you.Then you can optionally style the card-footer element.demo: https://jsfiddle.net/rustynox/203zwyq6/"},

I would not recommend switching to using just DIVs to arrange your content if it fits the purpose of tables - to display multidimensional data.I agree with Hristo but there are some cases where table need to be used and solution to your table problem is adding below class to the table and then changing any td width as per your need.I hope this helps for someone who is looking for table solution!Giving it both max-width and min-width attributes should work.I had the same problem with a bunch of columns where I wanted spacers columns.\nI used to do:But when the table was wider than window, the spacers were not really 10px, but maybe 5px.\nAnd using only DIVs without a TABLE was not an option in my case.\nSo I tried:And it worked very well ! :)The best way to set your column widths (td's) is to use a table header (th's). Table headers will set the width on your td's automatically. You just have to make sure that your columns inside your thead are the same number of columns in your tbody.Check it out here:\nhttp://jsfiddle.net/tKAj8/HTMLCSSUse table-layout property and the \"fixed\" value on your table.After setting up the entire width of the table,\nyou can now setup the width in % of the td's.You can learn more about in on this link: http://www.w3schools.com/cssref/pr_tab_table-layout.aspI had issues with not being able to size columns in a table-layout: fixed table that was using a colspan. For the benefit of anyone experiencing a variant of that issue where the suggestion above doesn't work, colgroup worked for me (variation on OP's code):For those that are having Table Cell/Column width problems and table-layout: fixed did not help.When applying fixed widths to table cells (<td> or <th>), do not assign a width to all of the cells. There should be at least one cell with an (auto) width. This cell will act as a filler for the remaining space of the table.e.g.P.S. you can use style classes here, you don't need to use an in-line style.Can't modify <td> width; that is, column width isn't settable. You can add the styling white-space:nowrap; which might help. Or you can add &nbsp;s to add space to columns.Maybe you could set col width the HTML way: <td width=\"70%\">January>/td>Unfortunately, in HTML 4.01 and later, that way isn't valid.How about something like this...http://jsfiddle.net/qabwb/1/HTMLCSS"},

Is there a way to \"fix\" that globally, either through CSS or by adding something to the HTML? Because different font is used in those types of fields.The fix is simply to specify that all inputs use the same font.You could append a fixed width for all inputs on the current page:The problem is Internet Explorer's default encoding. Internet Explorer has an issue displaying the field lengths the same when using UTF-8 encoding. In IE, try changing the encoding to \"Windows\" (Page->Encoding in IE 8) while viewing a problem page and you'll see exactly what I mean.If you include the jQuery library in your page(s), you can use the following code to:\"When the document is fully loaded, take the first input element with type='text', and apply it's height and width to all input elements with type='password'\".I tested this on IE7 only, and it worked like a charm.This is a generalized answer (taking the first element that matches input[type='text']).  You can get a reference to a particular element that you want to match, and then get a reference to one or more password boxes with some other jQuery selector.  Have a look at the documentation for getting elements by id or a group of elements by a common css class or xpath-type expression:http://docs.jquery.com/SelectorsSetting the width on textboxes will solve but I assume that's not what you want.Try setting the min-width on input[type=text], input[type=password] to something greater than the default for textboxes. You'll probably need http://deanedwards.me.uk 's IE8 script to make those selectors work.The font size is irrelevant.  as seen in this test here:\nhttp://build.jhousemedia.com/ie_test.phpI wish I could give you a solid answer as to why but the work around is to apply a fixed width to it."},

I'm hoping there's a simple jquery plugin or .htc file which just looks at text-shadow css property of an element and implements it for IE9.Yes, but not how you would imagine. According to caniuse (a very good resource) there is no support and no polyfill available for adding text-shadow support to IE9. However, IE has their own proprietary text shadow (detailed here).Example implementation, taken from their website (works in IE5.5 through IE9):For cross-browser compatibility and future-proofing of code, remember to also use the CSS3 standard text-shadow property (detailed here). This is especially important considering that IE10 has officially announced their intent to drop support for legacy dx filters. Going forward, IE10+ will only support the CSS3 standard text-shadow.As IE9 does not support CSS3 text-shadow, I would just use the filter property for IE instead. Live example: http://jsfiddle.net/dmM2S/can be replaced withYou can get the results to be very similar.Try CSS Generator.You can choose values and see the results online. Then you get the code in the clipboard.\nThis is one example of generated code:I was looking for a cross-browser text-stroke solution that works when overlaid on background images. think I have a solution for this that doesn't involve extra mark-up, js and works in IE7-9 (I haven't tested 6), and doesn't cause aliasing problems.This is a combination of using CSS3 text-shadow, which has good support except IE (http://caniuse.com/#search=text-shadow), then using a combination of filters for IE.  CSS3 text-stroke support is poor at the moment.IE FiltersThe glow filter (http://www.impressivewebs.com/css3-text-shadow-ie/) looks terrible, so I didn't use that.David Hewitt's answer involved adding dropshadow filters in a combination of directions. ClearType is then removed unfortunately so we end up with badly aliased text.I then combined some of the elements suggested on useragentman with the dropshadow filters.Putting it togetherThis example would be black text with a white stroke. I'm using conditional html classes by the way to target IE (http://paulirish.com/2008/conditional-stylesheets-vs-css-hacks-answer-neither/).I tried out the filters referenced above and strongly disliked the effect it created. I also didn't want to use any plugins since they'd slow down loading time for what seems like such a basic effect.In my case I was looking for a text shadow with a 0px blur, which means the shadow is an exact replica of the text but just offset and behind. This effect can be easily recreated with jquery.This will create an identical effect to the css3 text-shadow below.here's a working example (see the large white text over the main banner image) http://www.cb.restaurantconnectinc.com/The answer of crdunst is pretty neat and the best looking answer I've found but there's no explanation on how to use and the code is bigger than needed.The only code you need:First you MUST specify a background-color - if your element should be transparent just copy the background-color of the parent or let it inherit. The color at the chroma-filter must match the background-color to fix those artifacts around the text (but here you must copy the color, you can't write inherit). Note that I haven't shortened the dropshadow-filter - it works but the shadows are then cut to the element dimensions (noticeable with big shadows; try to set the offsets to atleast 4).TIP: If you want to use colors with transparency (alpha-channel) write in a #AARRGGBB notation, where AA stands for a hexadezimal value of the opacity - from 01 to FE, because FF and ironically also 00 means no transparency and is therefore useless.. ^^ Just go a little lower than in the rgba notation because the shadows aren't soft and the same alpha value would appear darker then. ;)A nice snippet to convert the alpha value for IE (JavaScript, just paste into the console):ISSUES: The text/font behaves like an image after the shadow is applied; it gets pixelated and blurry after you zoom in... But that's IE's issue, not mine.\n\n\nLive demo of the shadow here: http://jsfiddle.net/12khvfru/2/"},

A solution is to use an image editor as follows: starting with the background image, copy the image, flip (mirror, not rotate) the copy left-to-right, and paste it to the right edge of the original, overlapping 1 pixel.  Crop to remove 1 pixel from the right edge of the combined image.

Is there any direct way to say, align the third column in all rows to right ?To answer your question directly: no.  There is no more simple way to get a consistent look and feel across all modern browsers, without repeating the class on the column.  (Although, see below re: nth-child.)The following is the most efficient way to do this.HTML:CSS:Why you shouldn't use nth-child: The CSS3 pseudo-selector, nth-child, would be perfect for this -- and much more efficient -- but it is impractical for use on the actual web as it exists today.  It is not supported by several major modern browsers, including all IE's from 6-8.  Unfortunately, this means that nth-child is unsupported in a significant share (at least 40%) of browsers today.So, nth-child is awesome, but if you want a consistent look and feel, it's just not feasible to use.You could use the nth-child pseudo-selector.  For example:Then in your table do:Edit:Unfortunately, this only works in Firefox 3.5.  However, if your table only has 3 columns, you could use the sibling selector, which has much better browser support.  Here's what the style sheet would look like:This will match any column preceded by two other columns.If it's always the third column, you can use this (assuming table class of \"products\"). It's kinda hacky though, and not robust if you add a new column.But honestly, the best idea is to use a class on each cell. You can use the col element to set the width, border, background or visibility of a column, but not any other properties. Reasons discussed here.Looking through your exact question to your implied problem:Step 1:  Use the class as you described (or, if you must, use inline styles).Step 2:  Turn on GZIP compression.Works wonders ;)This way GZIP removes the redundancy for you (over the wire, anyways) and your source remains standards compliant.A number of years ago (in the IE only days) I was using the <col align=\"right\"> tag, but I just tested it and and it seems to be an IE only feature:The snippet is taken from www.w3schools.com. Of course, it should not be used (unless for some reason you really target the IE rendering engine only), but I thought it would be interesting to mention it.Edit:Overall, I don't understand the reasoning behing abandoning this tag. It would appear to be very useful (at least for manual HTML publishing).This doesn't work in IE6, which may be an issue, but it'll work in IE7+ and Firefox, Safari etc. It'll align the 3rd column right and all of the subsequent columns left.if you have only two \"kinds\" of column styles - use one as TD and one as TH. Then, declare a class for the table and a sub-class for that table's THs and TDs. Then your HTML can be super efficient.The current draft of CSS Selectors Level 4 specifies structural selectors for grids. If implemented, we will be able to do things like:Of course, that doesn't help us today -- the other answers here offer enough practical advice for that.What you really want here is:but it looks like Gecko doesn't support this yet: it's been an open bug for over a decade.(Geez, why can't Firefox have decent standards support like IE6?)Use jquery to apply class to all tr unobtrusively.$(”table td”).addClass(”right-align-class″);Use enhanced filters on td in case you want to select a particular td.See jqueryThe <colgroup> and <col> tags that lives inside tables are designed for this purpose.

They also provide a CSS reset file, so you could use that as well, but you say you've already reset the CSS. For further details go to the YUI website. This is what I've been using and it works really well.One of the rules in applying CSS styles is \"last in wins.\"  This means if your CSS reset styles set elements to margin:0; padding:0 you can then override these rules by declaring your desired values for the same elements afterwards.You can do this in the same file (YUI offers a one-liner reset I think so I sometimes include it as the first line in my CSS file) or in a separate file that appears after the reset CSS <link/> tag.I think by normal behavior you mean \"the defaults for my favorite browser.\"  Your building up CSS rules for these elements is a part of the reset exercise.Now you might want to look into Blueprint CSS or other grid frameworks.  These grid frameworks almost always first reset styles to nothing, then build up the typography for common elements, etc.  This could save you some time and effort.You mean like:?Actually, sorry I mis-read your question, you're after something more like Eric Meyer's total reset @ http://meyerweb.com/eric/tools/css/reset/Rather than using a total CSS reset, think about using something like Normalize, which \"preserves useful defaults\".To find out what your browser thinks of as default, open a plain HTML file with lists and view the lists with a CSS debugger like Firebug, and look under the Computed tab.Check out YUI (Yahoo's open source user interface conventions).They have a base stylesheet that undoes their own reset css.\nThey dont actaully recommend you use it in production - since its counter productive but definitely might be worth checking out the file to get relevant snippets for what you want to 'undo'.I recommend you watch the 40 minute talk to get up to speed.Heres a short snippet of their base.css file :Download the full stylesheets below or read full documentation.Yahoo reset css | Yahoo base (undo) reset cssI'm personally a big fan of BlueprintCSS. It resets styles across browsers and provides some really convenient defaults (that are what you want 90% of the time). It also provides a layout grid, but you don't have to use that if you don't need it.If you want to see the css defaults for firefox, look for a file called 'html.css' in the distribution (there should be some other useful css files in the same directory). You could pick out the rules that you want, and apply them after a reset.Also, the CSS2 standard has a sample stylesheet for html 4.Normal behaviour for WebKit h1:Normal behaviour for Gecko h1:The rest of the elements should be there if you search the files.\"After applying a CSS reset, I want to get back to 'normal' behavior for html elements...\"If you've applied a reset, you would then have to add the rules for what you believe to be normal behavior. Since normal behavior varies from browser to browser this question is something of a non sequitur. I like @da5id's answer - use one of the many available resets and tweak it to suit your needs.Once you have assigned a value to a CSS property of an element, there is no way getting back the “normal” value for it, assuming “normal” means “browser default”, as it seems to mean here. So the only way to have, say, an h1 element have the browser default font-size is to not set the property at all for it in your CSS code.Thus, to exempt some properties and elements from CSS reset, you need to use a more limited CSS reset. For example, you must not use * { font-size: 100% } but replace * by a list of selectors, like input, textarea { font-size: 100% } (the list could be rather long, but e.g. browser defaults for font-size differ from 100% for a few elements only).It is of course possible to set properties to values that you expect to be browser defaults. There is no guarantee that this will have the desired effect on all browsers, current and future. But for some properties and elements, this can be relatively safe, because the defaults tend to be similar.In particular, you might use section Rendering in HTML5 CR. It describes “expected rendering” – not a requirement, though browser vendors may decide to claim conformance to them if they so wish, and generally this will probably keep implementations rather similar in this respect. For example, for h1 the expected settings are (collected here into one rule – in HTML5 CR they are scattered around):(There are additional contextual rules. E.g., nesting h1 inside section is expected to affect the settings.)I'm not resetting all the elements by default because the default styles are somehow browser depended, so they varies from browser to browser. Instead of using something like ul, ol { list-style: none; }, I'm adding a CSS class like r or reset and then I specify that if that is a ul which has a r class, reset it or otherwise please leave it to be untouched.By the way you need to add class=\"reset\" (for example) to all of those elements, which is extra work and code, however you'd have all of your default styles untouched at the end in return!"},

The other does not.Nothing significant.NoIn really simplified terms: Working from left to right, try to match the scheme, hostname, then path segments with the URI you are trying to be relative to.

Relative paths are useful when you make some program that has to use resources from certain folders that can be opened using the working directory as a starting point.Example of relative paths:Example of absolute paths:and so on. Imagine you have a window open on http://www.foo.com/bar/page.html\nIn all of them (HTML, Javascript and CSS):In HTML and Javascript, the base_path is based on the opened window. In big javascript projects you need a BASEPATH or root variable to store the base_path occasionally. (like this)In CSS the opened url is the address of which your .css is stored or loaded, its not the same like javascript with current opened window in this case.And for being more secure in absolute paths it is recommended to use // instead of http:// for possible future migrations to https://. In your own example, use it this way:Relative PathsA relative path assumes that the file is on the current server.  Using relative paths allows you to construct your site offline and fully test it before uploading it.For example:php/webct/itr/index.php.Absolute PathsAn absolute path refers to a file on the Internet using its full URL. Absolute paths tell the browser precisely where to go. For example:http://www.uvsc.edu/disted/php/webct/itr/index.phpAbsolute paths are easier to use and understand.  However, it is not good practice on your own website.  For one thing, using relative paths allows you to construct your site offline and fully test it before uploading it.  If you were to use absolute paths you would have to change your code before uploading it in order to get it to work. This would also be the case if you ever had to move your site or if you changed domain names.  Reference: http://openhighschoolcourses.org/mod/book/tool/print/index.php?id=12503If you use the relative version on http://www.foo.com/abc your browser will look at http://www.foo.com/abc/kitten.png for the image and would get 404 - Not found.Going Relative:Going Absolute:I think this example will help you in understanding this more simply.Path differences in WindowsWindows absolute path\nC:\\Windows\\calc.exeWindows non absolute path (relative path)\ncalc.exeIn the above example, the absolute path contains the full path to the file and not just the file as seen in the non absolute path. In this example, if you were in a directory that did not contain \"calc.exe\" you would get an error message.

To find the full absolute path of the current directory use the pwd command.It is a best practice to use relative file paths (if possible).When using relative file paths, your web pages will not be bound to your current base URL.

Thanks to those who suggested other methods to keep CSS code smaller as well.It's great until you re-design, and narrow is highlighted yellow, center converts better left-justified, and the image you called floatleft now belongs on the right.I'll admit to the sin of using floatleft and clear as CSS class names, but it is much easier to maintain your CSS if you choose names that relate to the semantic meaning of the content, like feedback and heroimage.Presentational class namesThe HTML spec is clear on this issue: Does clearleft describe the nature of the content? Not really. Eric Meyer made a joke about this a while ago.Try to find a structural relation between the seemingly unrelated elementsLet's say you have paragraphs about ducks, paragraphs about monkeys and paragraphs about frogs. You want them have a blue background. You could add this CSS rule:But aren't they all animals? Just add another animal token:And change the CSS rule to:It is hard and it might not always be possible but the important thing is not to give up quickly.What if you can't?If you have a lot of elements with absolutely no structural relation between them, that indicates a structural problem with your document. Try to decrease these elements. That said, grouping n CSS selectors on one rule is still better than adding n presentational class tokens in your HTML document. Style classes should be semantic. This is a great article on semantic web page design (well, I found it really helpful anyway).EDIT: I just read another article that makes some good points for using things like display: inline-block, display: table etc. instead of floats. That should help avoid those pesky floatleft and clearfix classes. Making them semantic is always up to you though.The main problem with having classes named floatleft, clear or the like is the fact that changes in the design imply changes in the HTML markup. This should not happen, true separation between content and presentation is achieved only when you can re-use the same markup in multiple designs or even media (think sharing the same HTML between desktop and mobile versions of your site and only switching sylesheets).Now, for a practical example :). To add on Fredrik's answer, LESSCSS allow you to hide styles declarations/mixins from developers. This way you can protect reusable components in your stylesheets without the danger of having them pop up in your HTML.Sample markup:Sample less code:Of course, for mobile you might just want to have the company name in bold, without any other styling:I think it depends on how you are using the styles.Content should be named accordingly, as the style may change but the content will likely remain the same.For instance, if you have a div that contains stock info, you should name the div something like div class=\"stockInfo\", so that no matter what the presentation, you can change the styles and the name will not contradict those styles (as opposed to naming the div div class=\"yellow\" and then changing the background-color to red).However you will have \"helper styles\" and these should be named for what they do.For instance, you will likely want to use a <br /> to clear some floats.  In this case, it is perfectly reasonable to name it <br class=\"clear\" /> and to give it a style of br {clear:both;}.  Again, most Web sites float their images right or left.  To assist with this, you can set <img class=\"right\" src=\"\" /> and <img class=\"left\" src=\"\" /> and then have the styles to match, img.right {float:right;} etc.So it depends on the usage. Class names and ids that describe the function is better than using names that describe the styling of the element.I usually end up not doing it religiously though, because it is in my opinion more convenient to i.e. clear floating elements by using the famous clearfix hack rather than adding clear:both all over the stylesheets.But I think that LESS and SASS creates interesting opportunities to get the best out of both worlds, because you can have mixins and functions that describes some style and still have semantic correct names by just including whatever 'style' you want.Instead of having this HTML and CSSyou could use SASS to create this mixin:and include it into your .navigation class like this:which would reduce your HTML to this:and therefore still get the advantage of having semantic correct names while having a convenient way to share styles between different elements.Andrew; it's good to give sensible name to an class & id which easy to understand for you & your fellow member's which are working on that project. For me classes small , center , floatleft etc define nothing to me because when you give class center that's indicate that the element on the center but there are other properties also in that class like color, background etcFor example in this example class center don't clear to me. but we can use them as a helper class.For example from above example now it clear to me what the role of class center in that panel div  FOR MORE CHECK THESE LINKS :What's the best way to name IDs and classes in CSS and HTML?http://www.ronniesan.com/blog/entry.php?title=organizing-your-dom-elements-with-the-proper-idshttp://cssglobe.com/post/3745/my-top-10-most-used-css-class-namesIf your question is:Then my flat answer would be that in real world, semantic and presentation isn't everything.

When you're 3 days late, believe me, classnames like \"nopadding\" starts to appear, as you don't have anymore time to think straight about semantic (neither does your client).Depends on so many things, I'd say...  That's my \"real life\" point of view of your question.From what I've seen, developers have the tendency to overload their HTML pages with way too many unnecessary classes and extra markup. These classes not only make the page size bigger (and thus the load time longer), they also crowd up the page and make it difficult to manage and modify at a later time. Having things like center and float-left might be helpful when you're dealing with display text that was input by a user (such as a post on a forum), but for general markup purposes you're better off just adding text-align: center and float: left to the appropriate classes. This especially helps if you are trying to change the appearance of your site without changing the HTML much. The less you have hardcoded into your template, the easier it is to only have to change around the CSS when modifying your template. That bit alone is worth it to me.As a general rule of thumb, you really should only give elements classes when it describes what the content is, not where or how it is being displayed. i.e. <span class=\"movie-information\"> instead of <span class=\"bold\">.The only time I feel that it makes sense to give an element a class when it isn't necessary is if you are concerned with Search Engine Optimization. You should definitely read up on Microformats if you are interested in seeing how adding the right classes can actually help search engines. That being said, adding classes that describe how the page is visually displayed does nothing for the search engines.The only time I would ever \"group\" classes is if they are either displaying the same thing, or if they are siblings. It gets really messy in your CSS when you have elements from all over your page defined together. You're much better off grouping your classes in your stylesheet in ways that you will be able to find them later, rather than saving a few lines by combining them.I think this is where old meets new in web technologies. From times past, it has been difficult to unobtrusively render an outstanding web experience. These class names mostly came in handy when websites were changing webmasters to aid them in understanding the code. It served its cause well but with the new technologies of this day and age, I think this is slowly dying out - infact, it should be dead.The question we should ask is, \"Do we need to create a new class for every new innovative design that could pass as a template?\". I do not think so. The markup on a site should do what it is meant for - markup. The class names used in the markup should be descriptive of the content and not its looks. The stylesheets - on the other hand - should be able to select elements on a document based on the information in the markup, and style them.I want to relate this to the Rails association naming convention. Consider this...  Obviously, this is not a real model; it is something I am using to drive a point. Consider the case of a deeply nested dependency. These names will grow ridiculous - if they aren't already (i.e. in CSS, <div class='mediumwidth floatright centeredtext graytheme master'></div> or something of the like)Now consider the case where you have different principles. Different developers and designers may - if not 'most definitely will' -  have different reasons for using a specific naming convention. How would this affect refactoring time. I will leave that to your imagination. Also, if your business partner notices a new trend with sites themes that attracts traffic - more technically, assume this business partner has performed some experimental A/B testing and come up with some specs - you don't want to change the contents of the whole stack (ie HTML and CSS and possibly JS pages) to implement this new style.In conclusion, keep styling hints out of your markup. Unobtrusively interact with the document to style and manipulate it. Sass gives you a fine way of styling a site while having your CSS mock your markup. jQuery is another awesome UJS library. HTML5 gives you methods too that make the markup more flexible and yields more information to CSS and JS.I don't think adding a descriptive class name to your document is really a big issue. I find it's easier to work with explicit class names like \"floatleft\" as opposed to things that are purely semantic or reliant on the cascade. It's usually easier for later developers who don't have the document structure in their heads as well.\nYou don't want to use them for everything--you wouldn't want to add a class of floatleft to every li in a left-floated menu, but these kind of styles are very good when you need to do a specific thing to one or more elements, and you want to make other developers aware that you did it.\nIt's like putting in <div class=\"clear\"> or even <div style=\"clear:both;\">: maybe not the prettiest but it sure is obvious what you are doing. \nMy rule of thumb is: whatever makes you have to think less, do that.\nEDIT: As I said in my comment above, this is most true for classes that refer to clearing and floats, i.e., things that are purely presentational, non-semantic, and yet must be referred to in the HTML. I think in this case it is actually preferable to indicate that you are using a purely presentational class, like floatleft, rather than forcing the float to be attached to some semantic element.I am a developer before a programmer, so for me I use something like a \"floatleft\" css class as a sort of UtilityMethod.\nMeaning, my css class is \"floatleft\"...and that's all that class does.\nso if I say <div class=\"floatleft\"></div> in my mind that is saying \"make this div float to the left\".\nSo if that Div also needs a blue background and is my main header it's going to have a different class for that and I end up with <div class=\"mainheader floatleft\"></div>Doing it this way also avoids issues with refactoring.  If I am changing my design later, I will know that \"floatleft\" ALWAYS floats things left and nothing more.I think, at the end of the day it is about what works for you. If your class name is descriptive of what it does, that does not really go against the rule of separating markup from styles. Another factor to consider is, are you the sole developer, or part of a team. If you are part of a team, or you know your code will be worked on later by other devs, you should establish, and document the naming conventions used.I am currently contracting with Down Jones on some very large projects, and we have a rather lengthy document on naming conventions for our classes, including when to use camel-case, or dashes or underscores, as well as specific prefixes on the class name based on the project we work on. It sounds crazy, but when you have a dozen or so front-end devs working on stuff at the same time, it is a life saver!You are saying something like this:so in order to use this class:ALTERNATIVE SOLUTIONUsage:By this you can actually remove the presentation information from the content. I personally name them things close to what they will be doing. Say I have a class that is on an image gallery and its a primary most used class it will be something like \"gallery\" or if I'm setting borders around things that are meant to be more decorative I'll name it \"decoborder\". I try to keep them semi short and somewhat related what task they provide. I don't like to do things like \"small, large, H1underlined\" or anything that can mimick another tag or function because that can just get confusing. Beyond that I think you should really name it in whatever way makes the most sense to you.If the question is only one of naming, then for one specific class...oror....changes absolutely nothing.  They are only different class names.  The programming functions the same.Either your content & presentation is separated, or it isn't... totally regardless of how you created the names.For what it's worth, if I remember correctly the class keyword in HTML isn't currently used for anything other than CSS stylesheets. Thus, the example that you provided......wouldn't really be a way of identifying data. I would suggest either the name or id attribute if you really want to identify data within your HTML tags. (They both have slightly different uses - name is generally used for server-side queries while id can be styled and is generally more versatile. IDs must be unique, but names don't have to be.) You can check further documentation using the W3C HTML specification.In short - don't worry about tying content to presentation through your tag classes; until they're specifically used for anything else, they will not have any real effect on your raw content. As such, I'd say name your classes whatever you want, as long as it makes sense. Personally, I would err on the side of logical naming versus style-type naming (e.g. class name \"editorcomment\" instead of class \"graybgfloatleft\" or something like that), but in the end, your class names aren't going to tie your data to your presentation like an ID or a name would.Good luck.I've done both and I have to say nowdays I lean towards using non presentational classnames. I found this nifty framework called OOCSS https://github.com/stubbornella/oocss/wiki which helped me alot when I was creating a new layout for my web application and suited my requirements so well. It is mostly because the definition of basic classes for spacing, headers and text works so well when you have to deal with alot of content. Because you use the same classes everywhere it helps make the layout better and maintainable.Offcourse this means a element in your html can look like this: <div class=\"unit size1of3 lastUnit\"> But isnt that what HTML is about? Making sure your information is presented properly. I disagree on the whole redesign point, be honest, when you have to redesign your website most CSS goes out the door anyways. And, by dividing the CSS into proper classes for spacing/heading/text it becomes less likely to have conflicting css rules that mess stuff up like ul li div{} Offcourse the classes do not describe the contents, but as CSS does not allow class inheritance and you have to support old technology like IE6...does it really matter? And do classnames like animal and duck really make for better html? Id like to think HTML is for the browser and when the browser renders it, thats for humans.  It depends, sometimes it makes sense just to add a class to let an element float. The problem with the semantic approach is that you will end up ball of mud of css classes. Sure, names like redLink or blackHeader have to be banned but sometimes you will need little helpers like \"clear\" or \"floatLeft\". Read this article  of Nicole Sullivan who explain this in deep.There are two things that I feel get entirely left out of these discussions all too often. The first is WHY you would want to be all semantic or all not. The keywords are Branding and Skinning. Presentational class names may be justifiable if you work on some internal, departmental websites where branding and skinning will never in a million years get funding. On the other hand, customer facing sites, such as car manufacturers and department stores live in a world where every single new product that gets launched results in an entirely new skin for the website. New colors, new layout, new background images and all of this lead by designers who should be able to make the change purely in css so there's no chance they can break any working php (or what-have-you). There are also branded sites, where you have multiple skins, potentially running on the same site simultaneously. On sites with that requirement, you can't have visual changes impact html or you end up breaking every other brand just to update one of them. In these situations, semantic class names are a necessity.The second thing that often gets left out is how to combat the problem of repeating groups of properties created by semantic class names, as in:People often point this out as a drawback of semantic names, and I think that that's a valid point. On the other hand I would like to point out that there are tools that can help you keep semantic css DRY, such as LESS and SASS. I did see one other commenter mention this above, but I just thought that this point was worth highlighting."},

For this example, we can illustrate just one child of the container:\nWe'll name outer rectangle .container, the inner rectangle .content and the image img. This arrangement is perfectly fine, as long as .content is always wider than img. Since we're dealing with percentages and probably working with a responsive design, this may not always be the case. If .content is ever thinner than img, cropping will occur:If the most interesting part of img is in the center, we need to get the browser to crop both edges evenly - leaving the best part of it visible, no matter what width of .content is.Fortunately, a solution is possible. Even better, no extra markup is required.For new browsers, you can translate itTo support IE8, you can still use the technique presented above by @BryceHanscomb.If you are anticipating that the image to be displayed will be so much longer than the display container, setting left: 100%; and margin-left: -200%; (from Bryce's answer) might not be enough to get the center part of the image. Just put a bigger percentage for both. Make sure that the other is half of the other though."},

And what is the best approach to solve my problem.The .row is meant to be used inside a container.  Since the container has padding to adjust the negative margin in the .row, grid columns used inside the .row can then adjust to the full width of the container. See the Bootstrap docs: http://getbootstrap.com/css/#gridHere's an example to illustrate: http://bootply.com/131054So, a better solution may for you to place your .row inside a .container or .container-fluidYou can use row-fluid instead of row, then you won't have this problem. (for previous versions of bootstrap)I am not sure of recent versions 3, any way :The issue is that the first column should not have half a gutter on the left, and the last should not have half a gutter on the right. Rather than use some sort of .first or .last class on those columns as some grid systems do, they instead set the .row class to have negative margins that match the padding of the columns. This \"pulls\" the gutters off of the first and last columns, while at the same time making it wider.For more information on this\nWhy does the bootstrap .row has a default margin-left of -30px?Are you using Bootstrap 3? My version of the css has -15px, not -13px. In any case, I've simply done what you've down, and overwritten the style.\nI believe it's because the .container class has a 15px padding on the left and right, and this negative margin on the rows will pull that content back out to the edge of the container.Old topic, but I was recently affected by this. Using a class \"row-fluid\" instead of \"row\" worked fine for me but I'm not sure if it's fully supported going forward. So after reading Why does the bootstrap .row has a default margin-left of -30px I just used the <div> (without any row class) and it behaved exactly like <div class=\"row-fluid\">I was facing this same issue and initially, I removed the row's right and left -ve margin and it removed the horizontal scroll, but it wasn't good. Then after 45 minutes of inspecting and searching, I found out that I was using container-fluid and was removing the padding and its inner row had left and right negative margins. So I gave container-fluid it's padding back and everything went back to normal.If you do need to remove container-fluid padding, don't just remove every row's left and right negative margin in your project instead introduce a class and use that on your desired containerI used \n    div class=\"form-control\"\ninstead of \n    div class=\"row\"That fixed for me."},

It led me to this canvas plugin which does the trickNew and Improved: -webkit- and Firefox Working Example, now re-sizable/fluid.JSCSSHTMLI put it in a click function, because I figured it would be the most likely use case. It will work just as well on document ready.Although the canvas representation wont be pixel perfect, I don't think it will really matter in most cases because its being blurred. Update: As requested this is now re-sizable. I also moved the cover div into the JS and added an svg fall back for Firefox. The resizing requires the canvas to be redrawn on each re-size, so I set it up to hide the canvas, overlay, etc while you're resizing and then replace it when the re-size stops. Basically you could have a overlay placeholder where you duplicate the main content and sync the scrolling of both divs, than apply css blur filter on the overlay only.A simple javascript will do:And for the CSS:I put together a working example for you (webkit only):http://jsfiddle.net/kmxD3/1/Have fun! :)The answer to this is no.The reason is that in order to do what you want you would need direct access to the bitmap used for the browser window to extract or manipulate the pixels in the area you want to blur (I wish, \"aero\" in a browser could look pretty neat..) or a filter that works on the elements behind the one you apply it to (or can have a limiting region set to it).As there is no native support to do this (besides canvas and extension API, or a library that generate canvas image from the html -> relatively slow) this will need to be done with trickery (images, splitting divs etc.) in either case.If you made everything in your page on a canvas you could do a lot of interesting things, but you would also need to perform layout, update, filtering etc. yourselves and therefor you would be back no non-optimized as Javascript is slower than native (not to mention it would be error prone).Until browsers allow you to grab a section of the window as a canvas (never? as that would require everything on that page to be same-origin or have content with special accept headers set) there is no way around but to do tricks.UpdateAs an demonstration that you can do it by using html2canvas etc, but having to use compromises (-> slow performance) - the demo is rough, experimental and needs tweaks to work well - but for the sake of demo only:\nhttp://jsfiddle.net/AbdiasSoftware/RCaLR/Result:Generalized function to grab part of background:Get part of window using html2canvas:Process the content:Recently, a new -webkit-backdrop-filter. This is currently supported in Safari 9.0, and Chrome behind a flag.Demo:Support right now is only Safari.

Obviously there will be performance issues if the content in main-copy is complex.It has still very limited suport (only Firefox) but one way to get it could be this:The CSS is quite simple:and the key is to use as background for partial overlay the main-view element.This demo uses only opacity because filters are not availables for Firefox.The element property for the background has been approved by w3c, so it could show sometime in the future in webkitIn the demo partial-overlay has been shift to the right to make more clear what is what"},

Is it best to use class, on say font variant or elements within the html? Then use id for the structure/containers? This is something I've always been a little uncertain on, any help would  be great.Use id to identify elements that there will only be a single instance of on a page. For instance, if you have a single navigation bar that you are placing in a specific location, use id=\"navigation\".Use class to group elements that all behave a certain way.  For instance, if you want your company name to appear in bold in body text, you might use <span class='company'>.The most important thing to understand is that IDs have to be unique: only one element with a given ID should exist within a page. Thus, if you're wanting to refer to a specific page element, that's often the best thing to use.If you have multiple elements that are in some way similar, you should use the elements class to identify them. One very useful, surprisingly little known fact is that you can actually apply multiple classes to a single element by putting spaces between the class names. Thus, if you posted a question that was written by the currently logged in user, you might identify it with <div class=\"question currentAuthor\">.Student ID cards are distinct. No two students on campus will have the same student ID card. However, many students can and will share at least one Class with each other.It's okay to put multiple students under one Class title, Biology 101. But it's never acceptable to put multiple students under one student ID.When giving Rules over the school intercom system, you can give Rules to a Class:Or you can give rules to a Specific Student, by calling his unique ID:IDs must be unique but in CSS they also take priority when figuring out which of two conflicting instructions to follow.The text would be white.classes are great when you want to apply similar styles to many different divs or elements.  ids are good when you want to address a specific element for formatting or for updating with javascript.An additional benefit to using an ID is the ability to target it in an anchor tag:Will allow you to in some other place link directly to that spot on the page:A common use for this would be to give each headline on a blog a datestamped ID (say id=\"date20080408\") which would allow you to specifically target that section of the blog page.It is also important to remember that there are more restricted naming rules for ids, primarily that they can't start with a number. See similar SO question: What is a valid value for id attributes in htmlThe HTML standard itself answers your question:No two objects may have the same ID, but an arbitrarily amount of objects may have the same class.So if you want to apply certain CSS style attributes to a single DIV only, that would be an ID. If you want certain style attributes to apply to multiple DIVs, that must be a class.Note that you can mix both. You can make two DIVs belong to the same class, but give them different IDs. You can then apply the style common to both to the class, and the things specific to either one to their ID. The browser will first apply the class style and then the ID style, so ID styles can overwrite whatever a class has set before.Some other things to keep in mind:Now you can style the logical division for much of your entire navarea with one class application.IDs should be unique.  CLASSes should be shared.  So, if you have some CSS formatting that will be applied to multiple DIV, use a class.  If just one (as a requirement, not as happenstance), use an ID.I think we all know what class is, but if you think of IDs as identifiers rather than styling tools, you wont go far wrong. You need an identifier when trying to target something and if you have more than one item with the same ID, you can no longer identify it...When it comes to writing your css for IDs and CLASSes, it's beneficial to use minimal css classes as far as possible and try not to get too heavy with the IDs until you HAVE to, otherwise you'll constantly be aiming to write stronger declarations and soon have a css file full of !important.The simple difference between the two is that while a class can be used repeatedly on a page, an ID must only be used once per page. Therefore, it is appropriate to use an ID on the div element that is marking up the main content on the page, as there will only be one main content section. In contrast, you must use a class to set up alternating row colors on a table, as they are by definition going to be used more than once.IDs are an incredibly powerful tool. An element with an ID can be the target of a piece of JavaScript that manipulates the element or its contents in some way. The ID attribute can be used as the target of an internal link, replacing anchor tags with name attributes. Finally, if you make your IDs clear and logical, they can serve as a sort of “self documentation” within the document. For example, you do not necessarily need to add a comment before a block stating that a block of code will contain the main content if the opening tag of the block has an ID of, say, \"main\", \"header\", \"footer\", etc.If it's a style you want to use in multiple places on a page, use a class. If you want a lot of customization for a single object, say a nav bar on the side of the page, then an id is best, because you're not likely to need that combination of styles anywhere else.id is supposed to be the element unique identifier on the page, which helps to manipulate it. Any externally CSS defined style that is supposed to be used in more than one element should go on the class attributeUse an id for a unique element on the page which you want to do something very specific with, and a class for something which you could reuse on other parts of the page.The id attribute is used for elements to uniquely identify them within the document, whereas the class attribute can have the same value shared by many elements in the same document.So, really, if there's only one element per document that's going to use the style (e.g., #title), then go with id. If multiple elements can use the style, go with class.I would say it is best to use a class whenever you think a style element is going to be repeated on a page. Items like HeaderImage, FooterBar and the like go well as an ID since you'll only be using it once and it'll help prevent you from accidentally duplicating it, since some editors will alert you when you have duplicate IDs. I can also see it helpful if you're going to generate the div elements dynamically, and want to target a specific item for formatting; you can just give it the proper ID at generation as opposed to searching for the element and then updating its class.My flavor of choice is to use class identification when css styles are applied to several divs in the same way. If the structure or container is really only applied once, or can inherit its style from the default, I see no reason to use class identification.So it would depend on whether your div is one of several; for instance, a div representing a question to an answer on the stackoverflow website. Here you would want to define the style for the \"Answer\" class and apply this to each \"Answer\" div.If you are using .Net web controls then it is sometimes a lot easier just to use classes as .Net alters web contol div id's at run time (where they are using runat=\"server\"). Using classes allows you to easily build up styles with separate classes for fonts, spacing, borders etc. I generally use multiple files to store separate types of formatting information, e.g. basic_styles.css for simple site wide formatting, ie6_styles.css for browser specific styles (in this case IE6) etc and template_1.css for layout information.Which ever way you choose try to be consistent to aid maintenance.  As well, an element you give a specific id to can be manipulated via JavaScript and DOM commands - GetElementById, for example.In general, I find it useful to give all of the main structural divs an id - even if initially, I don't have any specific CSS rules to apply, I have that capability there for the future.  On the other hand, I use classes for those elements that could be used multiple times - for example, a div containing an image and caption - I might have several classes, each with slightly different styling values.Remember though, all things being equal, style rules in an id specification take precedence over those in a class specification.In addition to id's and classes being great for setting style on an individual item verses a similar set of items, there's also another caveat to remember. It also depends on the language to some degree. In ASP.Net, you can throw in Div's and have id's. But, if you use a Panel instead of the Div you will lose the id. Classes are for styles you may use multiple times on a page, IDs are unique identifiers that define special cases for elements. The standards say that IDs should only be used once in a page. So you should use classes for when you want to use a style on more than one element in a page, and an ID when you just want to use it once. Another thing is that for classes you can use multiple values (by putting spaces in between each class, a la \"class='blagh blah22 blah') wheras with IDs, you can only use on ID per element. Styles defined for IDs override styles defined for classes, so in , the style settings of #uniquething will override the style of .whatever if the two conflict. So you should probably use IDs for things like, the header, your 'sidebar' or whatever, and so on - things that only appear once per page.For me : If use classes when i will do something in CSS or add name to elements and can use in all elements in a page.So IDs i use for unique elementEx :CSS :"},

So...If I understand correctly, the bundler won't try to minify the .min file again because it's already minified.  The only \"drawback\" is it does not concatenate the font-awesome.min.css content into the single css file that the bundler creates. It will be included separately.I add another answer to this question has I found the solution by mixing some of them.Last point is the key of all: distributed \"min\" versions of the js files, does not follow the \"CssRewriteUrlTransform\" rules.

Either one of these rules will work:Both combinators work identically here; the subtle differences between them only apply when you have other elements in the mix. Refer to the links provided for details.I think :nth-child() will do the trick.This styles all of the p tags except for the first because it starts on the 2nd child. You could then style the first p tag separately with p:first-child. Works everytime and doesn't need undoing:It takes every P that was preceded by a P. Don't set a property to undo it later.

A length is defined as an optional sign followed by a module and an optional unit of measure (although many properties actually require it):So, for example, valid CSS lengths are:Defining a length like this, the CSS engine parses the following:as a length followed by another length. In this case it would be 100% followed by -1px, which doesn't make sense to calc() at all. This is also explained in the relative MDN documentation page.In order to put two lengths in relation you need to use a distinct operator, therefore, following the above logic, you'll need to use whitespaces:"},

We had the same issue with EOT and WOFF fonts in all versions of Internet Explorer (7-11) not loading over HTTPS. After hours of trial and error and comparing our headers with other working sites we found it was the vary header that was messing things up. Unsetting that header for those file types fixed our issue right away.I ran into this problem with HTTPS, but not HTTP. For some reason IE would continue through the different font options, ignoring 200 OK responses.In my case, the problem was the HTTP header Cache-Control: no-cache for the font. While this will work fine with HTTP, over HTTPS it causes Internet Explorer to ignore the downloaded font.My best guess is that it's a variation of this behaviour:So, if you're seeing IE work through each font in the Developer Tools network view, it might be worth checking if you have a Cache-Control header and removing it.This usually happens due to following response headers while downloading the .woff or .eot files.In My case I am using spring-boot and to remove these header I had to do following . which solved the issue as well.Here is my fix:Using the URL Rewrite Addon for IIS to set Cache-Control header for all EOT files:Without cache headers, I have noticed that IE9 clients on Windows Vista still do not load fonts (even though on my newer development machine IE11 in IE9 emulation mode does so).I was able to fix the issue on the client machines, in the Internet Explorer, by going to:And unchecking the “Do not save encrypted pages to disk” option.HTHI seem to remember certain versions of IE cannot use an @fontface font hosted outside the site's domain (If the page is at http://a.domain.tld/page.html - font must also be in the http://a.domain.tld/) for one reason or another. Put the EOT file on your domain and try again maybe.IE9 blocks download of cross-origin web fontWorking solution for Apache/2.2.15 is to add .htaccessThis issue has now been resolved by adding the following entries to the httpd.conf or .htaccess in apache server.In order to get it to work we have changed from using FilesMatch to LocationMatch and now the headers are being set perfectly.Did you try directly downloading the EOT file over https? The SSL certificate appears to be bad (mismatched), which could very well be your problem.You should also make sure that there is a cross-domain policy set up for those files so while it may not be a factor in this issue, it could cause problems for certain browsers.This sounds like a problem with your CDN. You can verify this by changing your host file to have your SSL domain point to whatever IP your non-SSL traffic is served over. If the font renders, you'll need to call up your CDN and figure out what their servers are doing to font files.I Faced a similar issue, but it was the Vary header that was the culprit. In my setup I was using Ruby on Rails with the rack-cors gem. It was giving the font files a header of Vary: Origin. To fix this you can set the header to Accept-Encoding where you set up the middleware: Try full URLs with https://... . As https is slower because of the enlarging and uncompressable files, there are some tricks to deliver mixed http/https content, without getting an \"insecure content\" warning. You might search for them. Never needed to use such tricks.Ok, as far as I can tell this is an IE8 bug.  I created a workaround that at least works on Apache - use mod_rewrite to force HTTP for requests ending in '.eot' or '.eot?' and force HTTPS for all other requests.  In your .htaccess file, do:Not exactly pretty and I'm sure it adds some server overhead, running the string comparison every single request, but it fixes the issue :)Hi I've just run into the same problem and I've found a fix, hope this can help others. It is a bug in IE <= 8 as commented. You can see some information on the problem here https://communities.bmc.com/thread/88899. Basically the problem is downloading a file in IE over https with Cache: no-cache headers being set, try remove the cache headers to see if that is your problem.This answer may also help IE : Unable to download * from *. Unable to open this Internet site. The requested site is either unavailable or cannot be foundWanted to share my situation and solution in hopes it helps the next person.My fonts were being delivered over HTTPS via Amazon CloudFront, which was configured to serve static assets from our application that lives behind an Elastic Load Balancer.The fonts had the following headers:Based on other answers and things I could find on the internet, I would've expected this to work, since it was setting a max-age and had proper CORS configuration.  However, IE9 still would not render the fonts.The issue turned out to be the Cache-Control: no-cache=\"set-cookie\" header, which surprised me because that just says to not cache the Set-Cookie header (unless I'm mistaken).It took me awhile to figure out where that header was coming from.  This header was being added by our ELB because we are using sticky sessions via cookies, and I guess the load balancer is configured to use this Cache-Control header when it is setup that way.So turning off sticky sessions removed the header, and caused the fonts to render.  We were able to turn off sticky sessions for HTTP requests, and leave them on for HTTPS requests, which is fine because we force SSL for any non-static assets, but happily serve static assets to CloudFront with or without SSL.Hope someone else can find this information useful.Quite old question, but I think no one answered correctly. The problem is that the font has been loaded from another file and for me this seems to be a case for Access-Controll-Allow-Origin.It's working pretty much straigth forward add the following in your virtualhosts file or in .htaccess:and restart the apacheUsing web font with IE 11 over HTTPS can be problem while using HTTP works fine. There are only specific version of IE 11 affected, e.g. Both are IEs on Win 7. I haven't seen the problem on Win 8 or Win 10.Even though Google states to support Microsoft Internet Explorer version 6+, their fonts are affected in the same way as described above.Currently I know of no workaround, not even a way of detecting affected versions via HTML/CSS/JavaScript."},

No option scales the image better:\nhttp://www.maxrev.de/html/image-scaling.htmlI've tested FF14, IE9, OP12 and GC21. Only GC has a better scaling that can be deactivated through image-rendering: -webkit-optimize-contrast. All other browsers have no/poor scaling.Screenshot of the different output: http://www.maxrev.de/files/2012/08/screenshot_interpolation_jquery_animate.pngUpdate 2017Meanwhile some more browsers support smooth scaling:No support in IE9-IE11. The -ms-interpolation-mode setting worked only in IE6-IE8, but was removed in IE9.P.S. Smooth scaling is done by default. This means no image-rendering option is needed!Late answer but this works:https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/CSS/image-renderingHere is another link as well which talks about browser support:https://css-tricks.com/almanac/properties/i/image-rendering/One way to \"normalize\" the appearance in the different browsers is using your \"server-side\" to resize the image. An example using a C# controller:where WebImage is a class in System.Web.Helpers.WebImageExtension is defined below:note the option InterpolationMode.HighQualityBicubic. This is the method used by Chrome.Now you need publish in a web page. Lets going use razor:And this worked very fine to me!Ideally will be better to save the image beforehand in diferent widths, using this resize algorithm, to avoid the controller process in every image load.(Sorry for my poor english, I'm brazilian...)Your problem is that you are relying on the browser to resize your images. Browsers have notoriously poor image scaling algorithms, which will cause the ugly pixelization.You should resize your images in a graphics program first before you use them on the webpage.Also, you have a spelling mistake: it should say moz-crisp-edges; however, that won't help you in your case (because that resizing algorithm won't give you a high quality resize: https://developer.mozilla.org/En/CSS/Image-rendering)You should try to maintain a proper aspect ratio between the sizes you're scaling from and to. For example, if your target size is 28px, then your source size should be a power of that, such as 56 (28 x 2) or 112 (28 x 4). This ensures you can scale by 50% or 25% rather than the 0.233333% you're currently using.I've seen the same thing in firefox, css transform scaled transparent png's looking very rough.I noticed that when they previously had a background color set the quality was much better, so I tried setting an RGBA background with as low an opacity value as possible.This worked for me, give it a try.Some people said that an even fraction downsize avoids the problem. I disagree.In IE11 I find that reducing an image by 50% (e.g. 300px to 150px) yields a jagged resize (like it's using nearest-neighbor). \nA resize to ~99% or 73% (e.g. 300px to 276px) yields a smoother image: bilinear or bicubic etc.In response I've been using images that are just retina-ish: maybe 25% bigger than would be used on a traditional 1:1 pixel mapping screen, so that IE only resizes a bit and doesn't trigger the ugliness. This is possible! At least now that css transforms have good support:You need to use a CSS transform to scale the image - the trick is not just to use a scale(), but also to apply a very small rotation. This triggers IE to use a smoother interpolation of the image:Seems Chrome downscaling is best but the real question is why use such a massive image on the web if you use show is so massively scaled down? Downloadtimes as seen on the test page above are terrible. Especially for responsive websites a certain amount of scaling makes sense, actually more a scale up than scale down though. But never in such a (sorry pun) scale.Seems this is more a theoretical problem which Chrome seems to deal with nicely but actually should not happen and actually should not be used in practice IMHO.Remember that sizes on the web are increasing dramatically. 3 years ago, I did an overhaul to bring our 500 px wide site layout to 1000. Now, where many sites are doing the jump to 1200, we jumped past that and went to a 2560 max optimized for 1600 wide (or 80% depending on the content level) main content area with responsiveness to allow the exact same ratios and look and feel on a laptop (1366x768) and on mobile (1280x720 or smaller).Dynamic resizing is an integral part of this and will only become more-so as responsiveness becomes more and more important in 2013.My smartphone has no trouble dealing with the content with 25 items on a page being resized - neither the computation for resizing nor the bandwidth. 3 seconds loads the page from fresh. Looks great on our 6 year old presentation laptop (1366x768) and on the projector (800x600). Only on Mozilla Firefox does it look genuinely atrocious. It even looks just fine on IE8 (never used/updated since I installed it 2.5 years ago)."},

But if you don't plan on going chinese, or even if you do go chinese then utf-8 is fine.The only cons against using utf-8 is that it takes more space compared to various encodings, but compared to western languages it takes almost no extra space at all, except for very special characters, and those extra bytes you can live with. We are in 2009 after all. ;)If you want world domination, use UTF-8 all the way, because this covers every human character available at the world, including Asian, Cyrillic, Hebrew, Arabic, Greek and so on, while ISO-8859 is only restricted to Latin characters. You don't want to have Mojibake.I find iso-8859-1 very useful on a couple of sites where I have clients sending me text files that were created in Word or Publisher, that I can easily insert into the midst of PHP code and not worry about it - especially where quotes are concerned. These are local, U.S. companies, there is literally no other difference in the text on the pages, and I see no disadvantage in using that character set on those particular pages. All others are UTF-8."},

I just launched {lessins}, it is a library of common mixins, similar to bootstrap.less or less elements, but with a focus exclusively on mixins (the others include some unecessary variables, that seem remnants of other projects.)I have also organized the mixins into bundles. Check it out: https://github.com/jdmiller82/-lessins-Old question, but right now Lots of Love for Less (3L) is far more complete and generic than Preboot née Bootstrap!Try Preboot. It is a pretty cool LESS library from a member of Bootstrap team.This is an old question but let me share this recently made Bootstrap3-LESSHAT Boilerplate. The Boilerplate has the LESS Hat Mixin Library (counterpart of Compass) set up as well as the Font Awesome Iconset.There's a new library called more-or-less which is similar lesshat but a lot faster since it does not use inline-javascript.\nJust like lesshat it allows to use endless layers for e.g box-shadow or background-image.\nIt basically has all of the lesshat mixins plus a few other helpful functions.

I want to make an image look like a circle. Everything works fine in IE8+, Google Chrome and Mozilla Firefox. But Safari is acting kinda strange. Here is a demo picture:\nTo illustrate the problem in Safari, let's begin with a plain image.Here we have an image of 100px x 100px. Adding a border of 3px increases the element dimensions to 106px x 106px:Now we give it a border radius of 20%:You can see it starts cropping from the outer boundary of the element, not from the image itself.Further increasing the magnitude to 50%:And changing the border color to white:You can now see how the issue arises.Because of such behavior of the browser, when creating an image in a circle with a border, we have to make sure both the image and the border are given a border radius. One way to ensure this is to separate the border from the image by placing the image inside a container, and apply border radius to both of them.And now we have a nice circle border around the image on Safari.See DEMO.Seems this one works:http://jsfiddle.net/qWdf6/82/Have you tried the longhand markup?It seems like there are some bugs on using the short-hand notation with some versions of Safari.Simple way i did was use rounded PNG images and apply a border and radius of 50%example : http://www.laugfs.lk/#ourbusinessJust simply use box-shadow if you don't care the old browsers.Try this by adding overflow: hidden; to the set of rules. This is an issue with all the webkit browsers:Instead of putting the border on the image itself, put it on the container. Make sure the border-radius is on both the image and the containerIf the image's border radius is set the same as its parent div, the accepted solution works fine for circular images but not rounded rectangles because the width of the image is less than that of its parent div and the border radius needs to be scaled in proportion to the image, otherwise the image will appear more rounded than the parent div and there will be a gap between the inside edges of the parent div and the outside edges of the image.However, if you can specify your div/image widths in absolute dimensions it's possible to set a border radius for the image so that it will fit exactly inside its parent div, by taking into account the border width.HTML:CSS:RESULT:\nThis solution was also tested in Internet Explorer 9 and Chrome 43 and the results were the same.But if you have a border with radius on a div and inside it you have dynamic content (like if you click on that div, it slides down and show some other content), and you want to redesign your border with the same radius, you can use an aux class that redraw the radius (but the hack is that if you don't change the colour of the border the webkit will not redraw it).Eg:do not use the position:relative|absolute style attribute for your overflow:hidden \n rounded corner itemfor example"},

This gives us the power of <table> tag without using it.This solution is useful if you do not know the height of your element.The compatibilty is very good (relative to caniuse.com), with Internet Explorer >= 8.Here's the general solution using just CSS, with two variations. The first centers vertically in the current line, the second centers within a block element.As I understand it, vertical-align applies only to inline-block elements, e.g., <img>. You have to change an element's display attribute to inline-block for it to work. In the example, the line height expands to fit the span. If you want to use a containing element, such as a <div>, set the line-height attribute to be the same as the height. Warning, you will have to specify line-height: normal on the contained <span>, or it will inherit from the containing element.with thanks to Vlad's answer for inspiration; tested & working on IE11, FF49, Opera40, Chrome53centers in all directions nicely even with text wrapping, line breaks, images, etc.I got fancy and made a snippet\n"},

The answer I found was to add a spacer div above the element that will become fixed (nav element in my case), and set it to the same height as the nav element, and set it to display none.When adding the .fixed class to the nav, show the .nav-spacer div, and when removing it, hide it.  Since the height of the page changes instantly I have set the duration to 0.HTMLCSSJavaScriptJust building on Rich's answer, which uses offset.I modified this as follows:In 2019 with CSS3 you can do this without Javascript at all.

Additionally the .scrollTop property was simply the top of the top most element... that is to say 0 and always would be 0.\nAny tests I performed utilizing these two (and same with getBoundingClientRect results) would not tell me if the top of the navigation bar ever scrolled to the top of the viewable page (again, as reported in console, they simply stayed the same numbers while scrolling occurred). Solution\n\nThe solution for me was utilizing The value of the pageTop property reflects the viewable section of the screen, therefore allowing me to track where an element is in reference to the boundaries of the viewable area.\nThis allowed a simple function assigned to the scroll event of the window to detect when the top of the navigation bar intersected with the top of the viewable area and apply the styling to make it stick to the top.Probably unnecessary to say, anytime I am dealing with scrolling I expect to use this solution to programatically respond to movement of elements being scrolled. \n Hope it helps someone else."},

If you have something like this:And you require it into your application.css file. Then pancakes_house goes through ERB first and that output goes through the LESS processor and whatever comes out of that goes into your CSS. Putting ERB inside your SCSS might feel a little odd but, hey, it'll work and get the job done without too much weirdness.So you should be able to get at the necessary methods to produce your cache-busting image paths through your ERB.I only tried this with a Less file but it should work with .css.scss.erb as well.As an aside, you can also add your own functions to SASS:There are even some instructions on writing your own functions a little further down in the manual. However, I'm not sure how to get Sprockets to load your Sass::Script::Functions patches so I can't call this a practical solution; someone with stronger Sprocket Fu than me might be able to make this approach work though and I'd call this more elegant than ERBified SCSS.You can use Number 2 easily, just add .erb extension to your .scss file:and use asset_path method to get path to image with hash:this file will be processed by erb and then by sass.When using the asset pipeline, paths to assets must be re-written and sass-rails provides -url and -path helpers (hyphenated in Sass, underscored in Ruby) for the following asset classes: image, font, video, audio, JavaScript and stylesheet.image-url(\"rails.png\") returns url(/assets/rails.png)\n   image-path(\"rails.png\") returns \"/assets/rails.png\"The more generic form can also be used:asset-url(\"rails.png\") returns url(/assets/rails.png)\n   asset-path(\"rails.png\") returns \"/assets/rails.png\""},

What fonts equal these in japan?Web-font for Japanese, though there are few providers exist, is not really practical as you found the size of the font data is too big to download. Usually Japanese font has 8,000-16,000  glyph so making new fonts means you need to make at least 8,000 glyph, which is pretty heavy task. As a result of it, there are very few variations in Japanese fonts, and Japanese users also care about fonts less than Latin-character users.Most Japanese websites use default font sets provided on Windows or Mac. The latest ones are Meiryo and Hiragino Kaku Gothic Pro. For older versions such like Windows XP, it is good to add former default fonts MS Gothic(or MS Mincho)/Osaka.Some old browsers could not understand those font names in English, some others do not recognize the names in Japanese, so it is safe to write both in Japanese and English.Meiryo and Hiragino's order is, because Mac users may have Meiryo from MS-Office, and Hiragino is more familiar and matching well on Mac, better by starting Hiragino series.So the current recommended practice is like this,Fonts don't really have to be \"web fonts\" (woff) to be used on the web. I use several of these on my website:But here are some free Japanese web-fonts (that I also use):I am no font/design expert, but just about every Japanese PC should have basic Latin fonts like the ones you mentioned installed, so they will work. But those fonts give a kind of Western look to Japanese characters. If you want to use fonts that Japanese sites typically use I would start by browsing some of the more popular Japanese sites and using things like Firebug or the Chrome developer tools to examine the CSS and see what fonts they reference. For example, yahoo.co.jp currently has this CSS:The \"gothic\" typeface fonts seem fairly popular these days: on Windows, fonts like MS Gothic, MS PGothic, etc. Ming typeface is also widely used. These are the default browser font settings for Firefox on my Japanese Windows machine:The proportional font is the sans-serif font, which is MS PGothic, serif font is MS PMing, and the monospace font is MS Gothic.BTW, the \"Osaka\" font was a standard font on Japanese Macs in the 90s. Unless you want that \"retro\" feel, is highly recommended to use \"Hiragino Sans\" (not Kaku Gothic that's deprecated) for macOS and iOS devices for a consistent and modern look and better legibility. Also Hiragino Sans has far more font weights (10) than Kaku Gothic (only 2).This is an old thread but for anyone doing research on this now, you should note that Meiryo is no longer a standard font loaded with Windows. Since Windows 10, the new default font is Yu Gothic. You can still install Meiryo manually however. Please see this articleThis is an old thread, but I was researching this today and found that Noto Sans is production ready (something I had read about a few years ago).I've tried it out in Japanese and it looks really good, link here: https://www.google.com/get/noto/The Japanese font is called 'Noto Sans CJK JP' (China/Japan/Korea Japan) if you do not wish to download the whole package.'Noto Sans CJK JP' is also available for Ubuntu linux. It is provided as an official package \"fonts-noto-cjk\". Still manual installation is required, it is expected to have it installed on Japanese Ubuntu machines.For whom may come in the future, there is a great (long and deep) article on this very matter written by a japanese copywriter: The Most Comprehensive Guide to Web Typography in Japanese.For instance:So, it's not only a matter on quantity, but also on pixels per character.

As of Bootstrap 4 Alpha 6, flexbox is default so the additional CSS is not required for flexbox, and the h-100 class can be used to make the cards full height: http://www.codeply.com/go/gnOzxd4SpkRelated question: \nBootstrap 4 - Responsive cards in card-columnsHere's a solution with Sass to configure the number of cards per line depending on breakpoints: https://codepen.io/migli/pen/OQVRMwIt works fine with Bootstrap 4 beta 3EDIT (2019/10)I worked on another solution which uses horizontal lists group + flex utilities instead of card-deck:https://codepen.io/migli/pen/gOOmYLbIt's an easy solution to organize any kind of elements into responsive gridI got this to work by adding a min-width to the cards:The cards don't go below this width, but still properly fill each row and have equal heights.I created 4 cards and place this code between second and third card, try this.I've used CSS Grid to fix that.\nCSS Grid will make all the elements in the same row, all the same height.I haven't looked into making all the elements in all the rows the same height though.Anyway, here's how it can be done:HTML:CSS:Here's a complete JSFiddle.\nhttps://jsfiddle.net/bluegrounds/owjvhstq/4/This answer is for those who are using Bootstrap 4.1+ and for those who care about IE 11 as wellCard-deck does not adapt the number visible of cards according to the viewport size.Above methods work but do not support IE. With the below method, you can achieve similar functionality and responsive cards.You can manage the number of cards to show/hide in different breakpoints.In Bootstrap 4.1+ columns are same height by default, just make sure your card/content uses all available space.\nRun the snippet, you'll understandI like Spanomaly's simple solution above of setting the min-width style. Note that it is applied to the card element.This also helps resolve another issue - having cards that aren't part of a full row being the same width as the ones that are. Simply set the max-width style to be the same as the min-width. Define columns by min width based on viewport:@Zim provided a great solution above (well deserved up-vote from me), however, it didn't quite fit what I needed since I was implementing this in Jekyll and wanted my card deck to automatically update every time I added a post to my site. Growing a card deck such as this with each new post is straight forward in Jekyll, the challenge was to correctly place the breakpoints. My solution make use of additional liquid tags and modulo mathematics.While this question is old, I came across it and found it useful, and maybe someday someone will come along wanting to do this with Jekyll.This whole code block can be used directly in a website or saved in your Jekyll project _includes folder.There's simpler solution for that - set fixed height of card elements - header and body. This way, we can set resposive layout with standard boostrap column grid. Here is my example:\nhttp://codeply.com/go/RHDawRSBolIt took me a bit to figure this out, but the answer is to not use a card-deck, but instead to use .row and .cols.  This makes a responsive set of cards with specifics for each screen size: 3 cards for xl, 2 for lg and md, and 1 for sm and xs.  .my-3 puts a padding on top and bottom so they look nice."},

Using the nowrap HTML attribute doesn't really achieve the desired result, as that just prevents line-breaks in the cell, rather than specifying a minimum width.However, if nowrap is used in conjunction with a regular cell width property (such as using width: 100px), the 100px will act like a minimum width and the cell will still expand with the text (due to the nowrap).  This is a less-than-ideal solution, which cannot be fully applied using CSS and, as such, would be tedious to implement if you have many tables you wish to apply this to.  (Of course, this entire alternative solution falls down if you want to have dynamic line-breaks in your cells, anyway).Another hack is the old 1x1 transparent pixel trick. Insert an 1x1 transparent gif image and set its width in the image tag to the width you want. This will force the cell to be at least as wide as the image.I know this is an old question but i thought I'd share something that wasn't mentioned (Although pretty simple in concept..) you can just put a <div> inside the table (in one of the <td>'s or something) and set the <div> to min-width. the table will stop at the <div>'s width. Just thought I'd throw that out there in case somebody comes across this on google. Also, I'm not so sure about how min-width is handled in I.E6. but that has already been covered in another answer.I had some success with:Based on a combination of Vatos' response and a min-height article here: http://www.dustindiaz.com/min-height-fast-hack/what about this css propertybut it doesn't really work in IE6 if not mistakenif you don't want to do it in the css way, I suppose you can add this attribute in your table data tagThis is a cross-browser way for setting minimum width and/or mimimum height:IE 6 doesn't understand !important\nIE 6 sees width/height:200px (overwriting auto)Other browsers understand the min- and the !importantI am not 100% familiar with the behaviour of widths in TD elements, but this all works nicely on eg DIV tagsBTW:This is not working because of the order of the first 2 lines, they need to be in the right order (think about the above) ;)IE6 handles width as min-width:If you want IE6 to handle width like normal browsers, give it an overflow:visible; (not the case here)"},

(emphasis is mine)So, the | symbol in the attribute selector would select only elements whose attribute value is either exactly the given value or starts with the given value followed by a hyphen.As you can see in the below snippet, the attribute selector which uses | ([data-test |= 'val']) doesn't select the element when the attribute value is like valid whereas the attribute selector with ^ ([data-test ^= 'val']) does.In a more real-world scenario, the attribute selector with pipe (|) can be used to select elements and apply specific styling depending on their language (which can be set using the lang attribute). As we can see in the snippet, |= 'en' selects all elements whose lang attribute is either en or en-GB or en-US (or any other en-* for that matter). As the spec states, the primary intention of this selector was to allow language subcode matches but  as BoltClock points out, this has by and large been superseded by the :lang pseudo-class selector.(Translations were by Google. Any mistake was unintentional)Additional Information: The attribute selector which uses pipe (|) was introduced in CSS2 and the attribute selector which uses the cap/caret (^) was introduced in CSS3.Simply put:Expanded Info:Source: http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-selectors/#selectorsHTMLTesting the pipe (|) selector.Testing the caret (^) selector.Actually[attr ^= value] is value*\nCaret (^) means starting with \"value\" (and obviously exact value as well)[attr |= value] is value OR value-* (i.e. [attr = value],[attr ^= value-])\nPipe (|) means either exact \"value\" or starting with \"value-\" (succeeded by dash (-))Example:"},

I haven't heard anything to suggest that at this point though.) layered on top of each other to have this blending effect applied.background-blend-mode would be quite similar, but would be intended for background images (set using background or background-image) rather than actual image elements.EDIT:\nThe next section is becoming a bit irrelevant as browser support is growing.. Check this chart to see which browsers have support for this: http://caniuse.com/#feat=css-backgroundblendmodeIf you've got the latest version of Chrome installed on your computer, you can actually see these styles in use by enabling some flags in your browser (just throw these into your address bar:)Enable those bad boys and then check out this fiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/cqzJ5/\n(If the styles are properly enabled in your browser, the two images should be blended to make the scene look like it is underwater)While this may not be the most legitimate answer at the current moment due to the almost entirely nonexistent support for this feature, we can hope that modern browsers will adopt these properties in the near future, giving us a really nice and easy solution to this problem.Some extra reading resources on blending modes and the css properties:Simple with a bit of SVG:and some CSS:The fiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/7uCQQ/381/Just for the record, this guy is developing a library to do so.

The only compositing options you get that are even close are:Neither are really practical.In general you should not attempt to export Photoshop comps as layers, but render them down to a single opaque image. For rollovers you can make two images (one for normal state, one for hovered) and swap between them using the CSS :hover style to choose a different background image, or—better, as it requires no preloading and reduces HTTP requests—combine both images into one and use background-image/background-position to display the right part of that image in each state as a background image. (“CSS sprites”)I recently had the need to do exactly what the OP asked so I searched around. I found a great way to replicate the multiply effect by making a transparent PNG in Photoshop.All credit goes to Sojeong from https://superuser.com/questions/381704/multiply-blending-mode-to-pngCheck this out:\nhttp://www.webdesign.org/photoshop/photoshop-basics/remove-white-using-channels.10545.htmlUsing those instructions, I had great success watermarking a black-and-white image (ink drawing in my case, with blacks and greys on a solid white background) onto a dark background (wood in my case). There is hardly any difference with the real Multiply filter of Adobe.I used the Photoshop instructions to remove the whites from my image, leaving only blacks and greys on a transparent background. Saving this to PNG and putting it on the wood in CSS/HTML still lookedmuch worse thanmultiply, but strongly reducing the brightness of the PNG solved it (the light greys stood out before, making it ugly).In general I recommend you play around in photoshop, replicating the web situation: a semi-transparent (no special stuff) layer on top of a solid background. Tutorials such as the above may allow you to reproduce multiply or other fancy effects.Not sure if you will have any luck. As far as I know, it isn't possible even if you tried to integrate some advanced JavaScript with it."},

There's no CSS rule which is to \"ignore some other rule\". The only way around it is to write a more-specific CSS rule for the inner elements which reverts it to how it was before, which is a pain in the butt.Take the example below:There's no way to make the .notBlue class revert to the parent styling.

The bottom of the image should be flush with the bottom of the last paragraph.The page width is variable (responsive), but the image dimensions are fixed. Is it possible to accomplish this in HTML and CSS (CSS3 is fine)? If not, can it be done with a minimal amount of Javascript?Here's a schematic example of what I want to accomplish:The HTML currently looks something like this, but it can be changed if necessary. I don't particularly care where in the document the image is located. Using background images instead would be fine too.When I set float: right on the image, it floats to the right but I cannot get it to align to the bottom of the page. Suggestions?Edit: the closest I got is this... :-)Create a spacer element with float: right and height equal to the height of the content minus the height of the image.  Then use float: right and clear: right on the image:http://cssdesk.com/bLNWsMy demo uses fixed dimensions in the container element.  Since that is rarely a realistic case, it probably makes more sense to use JavaScript to size the spacer.  Call this function, passing a reference to the spacer element when the document is ready and during the window.onresize event.This function works (see the demo), and can be reworked for jQuery or your library of choice.  It's not meant to be plug-in quality code, but serves to illustrate the concept.jsfiddle.net/n5RPV/9Edit: I created a jQuery plugin version (github | jsFiddle demo) that supports floating bottom left or bottom right.  It also supports specifying which element to align the bottom with.By the way, I didn't bother trying to support IE7.I think the future way how to tackle this problem will be with CSS Exclusions.This msdn article also explains exclusions Ironically, to date this only works in IE10 (look for wrap-flow:both here) This is what the code looks like:So as you can see - even though the exclusion is positioned absolutely - it still acts like a float - in this case: float bottom right. Regarding browser support:Check out this site which shows which properties are supported by the browsers (to date: only IE10+ supports wrap-flow:both )PS: Latest updates concerning CSS exclusions (and other simlar modules like CSS regions and CSS Shapes) can be found at the Adobe Web Platform Team BlogI have worked on a jQuery-based solution — probably not as elegant as the one posted by gilly3 though ;) and it's also slower and a bit bloated...My trick is to append two <div>s to the section, which is floated to the left and hidden width a width of 0. One of the div, a designated ghost element that will have the same dimension as the image, will be positioned below another div that is the designated height spacer. The script uses a while loop to establish if the ghost element has reached the bottom of the parent section element. If this has not happened, it will increment the height of the height spacer by 1, until the condition is satisfied.The markup I have used is as follow. I'm using the HTML5 attribute data-bottom-image to identify sections that you have the image to be floated to the bottom. Of course it is dispensable, depending on how you want to select for the correct section element.And the jQuery script:And here is the working Fiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/teddyrised/xmkAP/5/Possible CSS Solution: (only tested in chrome)It looks like this might work using CSS3's flex box properties and a combination of background-image properties. I was able to get it pretty close using only CSS. (It works but needs a little tweaking) Also, this may not be ideal cause I did have to change the markup a little bit to make this work. But its probably worth a shot if you are looking for a pure CSS solution.Here is a Demo -> http://jsfiddle.net/ADSH2/New Markup: (not to much different)CSS:Resources: With a little bit of JavaScript and CSS I did it like this:http://jsfiddle.net/stichoza/aSScx/One simple floatify() function.Idea inspired by: http://www.csstextwrap.com/CSS only Solution.Using media queries one can accomplish this layout.HTMLCSSIt plays well at different screen resolutions.

Main drawback is of course compatibility. Code below works in Firefox 25 and Explorer 10 and 11, but in Chrome (I've tested v30 and v32 dev) there are some subtle problems with lines disappearing if they are too narrow. Moreover disappearing depends on the box dimensions – style below works for div { width: 100px; height: 100px}, but fails for div { width: 200px; height: 200px} for which in my tests 0.8px in calculations needs to be replaced with at least 1.1048507095px for diagonals to be shown and even then line rendering quality is quite poor. Let's hope this Chrome bug will be solved soon.You can use SVG to draw the lines.Have a play here: http://jsfiddle.net/tyw7vkvmAll other answers to this 3-year old question require CSS3 (or SVG). However, it can also be done with nothing but lame old CSS2:Rather than actually drawing diagonal lines, it occurred to me we can instead color the so-called negative space triangles adjacent to where we want to see these lines. The trick I came up with to accomplish this exploits the fact that multi-colored CSS borders are bevelled diagonally:To make things fit the way we want, we choose an inner rectangle with dimensions 0 and LINE_THICKNESS pixels, and another one with those dimensions reversed:Finally, use the :before and :after pseudo-selectors and position relative/absolute as a neat way to insert the borders of both of the above rectangles on top of each other into your HTML element of choice, to produce a diagonal cross. Note that results probably look best with a thin LINE_THICKNESS value, such as 1px.Please check the following.JS:CSS:jsfiddleyou can use a CSS3 transform Property:Xdeg = your valueFor example...You can make more div and use a z-index property.\nSo,make a div with line, and rotate it.If you'd like the cross to be partially transparent, the naive approach would be to make linear-gradient colors semi-transparent. But that doesn't work out good due to the alpha blending at the intersection, producing a differently colored diamond. The solution to this is to leave the colors solid but add transparency to the gradient container instead:intrepidis' answer on this page using a background SVG in CSS has the advantage of scaling nicely to any size or aspect ratio, though the SVG uses <path>s with a fill that doesn't scale so well.I've just updated the SVG code to use <line> instead of <path> and added non-scaling-stroke vector-effect to prevent the strokes scaling with the container:Here's that dropped into the CSS from the original answer (with HTML made resizable):I needed to draw arbitrary diagonal lines inside any div. My issue with the other answers posted is that none of them allowed to draw an arbitrary line from point A to point B without doing the trigonometry yourself for the angles. With javascript & CSS you can do this. Hope it's helpful, just specify a pair of points and you're golden.Here is how I did this using the css clip-path property alongside relative and absolute positioning to create a more fancy cross.Here is a link to the code on codepen if you'd like to tweak it."},

Using the following table structureall we have to do is create a block element spanning the entire width of the table using ::before on the desired link (.rowlink) in this case.demoThe ::before is highlighted in red in the demo so you can see what it's doing.Unfortunately, no.

I so stupid. The below, while true...ish doesn't address the question well enough.If you want that configuration of the rotation to stay the same as you have illustrated, add a div between .scroll and .el, and style it such:Thus, it would seem that you want the .pers div switched with .scroll or add another after .scroll with the same perspective.Also, try moving the perspective: 300px; to .scroll. The angle appears to change as one scroll up or down.Original AnswerThe answer is not really. One cannot contain a 3D transform inside a container with clipping which is being attempted here.The problem is overflow-y:scroll breaks the transform-style property as per spec. The overflow-y affects the nested element. If your problem persists, you may also have to use the -WebKit-transform-style: preserve-3d declaration on .scroll, though I think iOS already has a stacking context established in this case (Firefox requires this, Webkit seems not to).One solution is to remove your overflow:hidden from body and overflow-y:scroll from .scroll, but I suspect you are going to want to have that as a smaller part of the page/screen and move image blocks inside it.If this is the case, you will need fake this with transforms and some clever hackery and should use opacity be part of this endeavor, please note that this too (as in spec above, right below the transform-style) causes the flattening effect when not applied to the final node. Let's say you had opacity other than 1 on .el, you are fine here as .el is the final node, but if opacity was applied to .scroll, the same flattening of .el occurs as with the overflow.Have yet to test on iOS as I lack access to the device.Note: setting an overflow value other than visible for the body does not cause this issue on most desktop browsers that support 3D transforms. I do not know about iOS/mobile.The shared snippet does not work on Mozilla Firefox as well. Below is the solution tested for iOS Safari/Chrome (iPhone-6S), Windows Mozilla/Chrome:no need to use -webkit-overflow-scrolling. There could be a possible bug for this feature as it is under development  [Reference Link]. Removing this property generates the desired behavior. It might not be the exact solution, but it can act as a workaround.Codepen: http://codepen.io/anon/pen/LxZZdXThis snippet from HERE   might do it.

So I have added type-checking:Use as follows:The CSS tranform property will always return a matrix value, as rotate, skew, scale etc. is just shorthand for doing things easier, and not having to calculate the matrix value everytime, however the matrix is calculated by the browser and applied as a matrix, and when that is done it can no longer return the rotated degree by angle without recalculating the matrix back again.To make such calcualtions easier there is a javascript library called Sylvester that was created for the purpose of easy matrix calculation, try looking at that to get the rotation degree from the matrix value.Also, if you where to write a rotate function in javascript to translate rotational degrees to  a matrix, it would probably look something like this (this uses sylvester for the last calculation) :Now all you really have to do is reverse enginer that function and you're golden :-)This script is very helpful\nhttps://github.com/zachstronaut/jquery-css-transformI have make a fiddle with this working code to get rotateX Y Z on a 3D , or rotateZ for a 2D transform.

The solution from Val is good, but has one issue - the inner div will stick to bottom, but it will not affect the height of parrent div, thanks to its \"position: absolute;\" (it is out of the page layout flow).So here is my expanded solution for anyone having similiar problem:As you can see, I set height of the .bottom ang padding-bottom of the wrapper. Disadvantage is, that the height of the footer is on two places. But I think it is a good solution for example for product list, where there is fixed height in footer of the box (like for price etc).

You can evaluate either CSS, or XPath expressions, it will list the matching elements, and also draw a red border around them.Yes you can go for FireBug, a versatile Firefox web development add-on.To test a CSS selector, go to the \"Console\" tab and enter a command in the bottom form (more info on how to find the command line).Inside the command line use the $$(\"your CSS selector\") syntax to test CSS selectors, explained in more detail here. For example use this command to select everything:Here's how to use the  built in CSS query selector in Firefox:Go to Tools > Web Developer > Web ConsoleAlso, you could press ctrl shift i in Windows/Linux, or cmd opt i in Mac.Type in your CSS selector (using traditional $$() syntax) at the very bottom left corner.The object node list will appear on the right hand panel of the console.This is handy for Selenium Webdriver instances of Firefox, where having an extension isn't feasible.Try firebug. http://getfirebug.com/Not sure if this helps. Try Firebug. Allows you to select an item, and see what it's css path is, as well as the css currently being applied.Can do some experimentation in the html/css right in the browser.FireFinder is good, but I started with and prefer FirePath for Firebug. It works similarly, but can give you an expanded view of the HTML around the matching elements w/o need to click inspect, FriendlyFire, etc.The field where you test the locator also has syntax checker where field turns red if syntax is bad. Just click eval to test the locator and matches show below with additional HTML around the matching elements.But for testing CSS locator, you'd want the drop down option of \"Sizzle\" rather than CSS in FirePath. The CSS option only works for simple CSS selectors, complex ones only work under Sizzle (l mode, such as:div.namedService.photoService > div.photoBrowserContainer:nth-child(3) > div.albumName:contains('someName')Selenium IDE 1.0.11 released has inbuilt CSS locator builderThe DOM standard function document.querySelectorAll is what you want, modern browser all support it. See the documenthttps://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/DOM/Document.querySelectorAllYou can call it in built-in web console. In console there is a shortcut $$, call it like $$('div a').I like firebug because it can click to scroll to view the element. It also can test in 'CSS' panel.The 'Find' button in Selenium IDE is very useful for this. It uses the same method to locate elements as your tests will, so can be used to locate elements using any of the supported strategies.With jQuery you could easily add a large red border to an element using the selector.Firebug (https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/1843) or Web Developer Toolbar (https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/60). Both show path.Firefinder is great for testing selectors. However, if also you want to obtain the CSS selector for an element try SelectorGadget.I've found FirePath to be really great, it lets you look up not only CSS but xPath as well.

You're not going to reach very far in terms of browser support (IE8 and older) unless you add classes to your first and last children, using JavaScript or otherwise.Remember that vertical margins collapse between in-flow paragraphs and their ancestor(s), so unless you want to zero out the margins of the container element for these paragraphs as well, you shouldn't need to zero out the margins of the first and last p elements specifically. Here's a fiddle to illustrate.Well, you could do:But only the most recent browsers support the :not psuedo-class.Other than that, no. Your best option is to specify a style for all and then override it for the first/last.If IE7-8 support is not needed you can use the :not() CSS selector.But if you need to support IE7+, which may still be the case there is a little trick you can use and usually gets you fairly far. A lesser known fact is that the :first-child psuedo selector actually works in IE7+ (not :last-child though) as are some other css selectors and this makes stuff like adding vertical margins in a horizontally floated layout possible.Imagine this html:And this as some CSS:So now all list items are horizontally next to each other, and now we want to add a margin in BETWEEN all items but not on the right or left side, we can do this in css:This usually covers 95% of the cases where I want something unique, then the rest of the 'forgotten' selectors cover another few percent, after that you need to add some classes which usually isn't much of a bottleneck anyway in the backend of the page.I would suggest to use first-of-type:Browser support (caniuse)"},

(all CSS is in the <head> via a <link>).Also, here's the script that's causing the issue (yes, it's been taken straight from here):Thanks.From the 1.3 release notes: From the ready(fn) documentation:Note that the above is not even about actually rendering the CSS, so you may still see the screen change when ready() kicks in. But it should save you from problems.Actually, I find it a bit strange that just putting the CSS above the JS will solve all issues. The CSS is loaded asynchronously, so JS loading can start and finish while the CSS is still being downloaded. So if the above is a solution, then executing any JS code is then halted until all earlier requests have completed?I did some testing, and indeed, sometimes JS is delayed until the CSS is loaded. I don't know why, because the waterfall shows that the JS has completed loading long before downloading the CSS has finished.See JS Bin for some HTML and its results (this has a 10 second delay), and see webpagetest.org for its waterfall results. This uses some script from Steve Souders' cuzillion.com to mimic slow responses. In the waterfall, the reference to resource.cgi is the CSS. So, in Internet Explorer, the first external JS starts to load right after the CSS was requested (but that CSS will take another 10 seconds to finish). But the second <script> tag is not executed until the CSS has finished loading as well:Another test with a second external JS after getting jQuery, shows that the download of the second JS is not started until the CSS has loaded. Here, the first reference to resource.cgi is the CSS, the second the JS:Moving the stylesheet below all JS indeed shows that the JS (including the ready function) runs much earlier, but even then the jQuery-applied class --which is yet unknown when the JS runs-- is used correctly in my quick tests in Safari and Firefox. But it makes sense that things like $(this).height() will yield wrong values at that time.However, additional testing shows that it is not a generic rule that JS is halted until earlier defined CSS is loaded. There seems to be some combination with using external JS and CSS. I don't know how this works.Last notes: as JS Bin includes Google Analytics in each script when running from the bare URL (like jsbin.com/aqeno, the test results are actually changed by JS Bin... It seems that the Output tab on the edit URL such as jsbin.com/aqeno/edit does not include the additional Google Analytics things, and surely yields different results, but that URL is hard to test using webpagetest.org. The reference to Stylesheets Block Downloads in Firefox and JavaScript Execution in IE as given by strager is a good start for a better understanding, but I got many questions left... Also note Steve Souders' IE8 Parallel Script Loading to make things even more complicated. (The waterfalls above are created using IE7.)Maybe one should simply believe the release notes and documentation...CSS/JavaScript/JQuery ordering doesn't work for me, but the following does:The DOM ready fires when all the DOM nodes are available. It has nothing to do with CSS. Try positioning the style before or try loading it differently.To the best of my knowledge the ready event is fired when the DOM is loaded - which means that all the blocking requests (i.e. JS) have loaded and the DOM tree is completely graphed. The ready state in IE relies on a slower event trigger (document.readyState change vs DOMContentLoaded) than most other browsers so the timing is browser dependant also.The existence of non-blocking requests (such as CSS and images) is completely asynchronous and unrelated to the ready state. If you are in a position where you require such resources you need to depend on the good old onload event.In molily's tests (2010),All modern browsers now support DOMContentLoaded (2017) so they may have standardized this behavior by now."},

After all, this is something very new.However, since you're working in JavaScript, you have far more options available to you than if you were just using CSS.For example:You can also check for some slightly more loose comparisons:an event is fired when the browser changes full screen mode. You can use that to set a variable value, which you can check to determine if the browser is full screen or not.This will work on IE9+ and other modern browsersUsing \"1\" (instead of zero) because the system, at times, might just reserve a one pixel height for mouse interaction with some hidden or sliding command bars, in which case the fullscreen detection would fail. Use fullscreenchange event to detect a fullscreen change event, or if you don't want to handle vendor prefixes than you can also listen to the resize event (the window resize event that also triggers when fullscreen is entered or exited) and then check if document.fullscreenElement is not null to determine if fullscreen mode is on. You'll need to vendor prefix fullscreenElement accordingly.

Windows laptops now frequently come with touch screens.Other similar SO answers (see other answer on this question) might have different ways to try to figure out what sort of device the user is using, but none of them are fool-proof. I encourage you to check those answers out if you absolutely need to try to determine the device.iPhones, for one, ignore the handheld query (Source). And I wouldn't be surprised if other smartphones do, too, for similar reasons.The current best way that I use to detect a mobile device is to know its width and use the corresponding media query to catch it. That link there lists some popular ones. A quick Google search would yield you any others you might need, I'm sure.For more iPhone-specific ones (such as Retina display), check out that first link I posted.Here's how I did it:Based on https://stackoverflow.com/a/42835826/1365066Detecting mobile devicesRelated answer: https://stackoverflow.com/a/13805337/1306809There's no single approach that's truly foolproof. The best bet is to mix and match a variety of tricks as needed, to increase the chances of successfully detecting a wider range of handheld devices. See the link above for a few different options.Don't detect mobile devices, go for stationary ones instead.Nowadays (2016) there is a way to detect dots per inch/cm/px that seems to work in most modern browsers (see http://caniuse.com/#feat=css-media-resolution). I needed a method to distinguish between a relatively small screen, orientation didn't matter, and a stationary computer monitor.Because many mobile browsers don't support this, one can write the general css code for all cases and use this exception for large screens:Both Windows XP and 7 have the default setting of 1 dot per pixel (or 96dpi). I don't know about other operating systems, but this works really well for my needs.Edit: dppx doesn't seem to work in Internet Explorer.. use (96)dpi instead.I believe that a much more reliable way to detect mobile devices is to look at the navigator.userAgent string.  For example, on my iPhone the user agent string is:Note that this string contains two telltale keywords: iPhone and Mobile.  Other user agent strings for devices that I don't have are provided at:https://deviceatlas.com/blog/list-of-user-agent-stringsUsing this string, I set a JavaScript Boolean variable bMobile on my website to either true or false using the following code:I know this is an old thread but I thought this might help someone:Mobile devices have greater height than width, in contrary, computers have greater width than height.

So when you include your template, you get another (invisible) BOM inserted into your page...This causes a gap at the start of your page, where the browser renders the BOM, but it looks invisible to you (and in the inspector, just shows up as whitespace/quotes.Save your template files as UTF-8 without BOM, or change your template engine to correctly handle UTF8/BOM documents.If nothing of the above helps, check if there is margin-top set on some of the (some levels below) nested DOM element(s).It will be not recognizable when you inspect body element itself in the debugger.

The solution is to make the table width 100% and use a negative margin on a containing element:See it as a jsFiddleI optimized the solution with transparent border so it has no more obliquely cut inner borders.1) let table fill horizontal and collapse the borders:2) Set all borders of table cells to width 0 and prevent background is drawn below the border.3) Set inner space with transparent border but not to first row and column.here is a jsbinSimilar to what Steven Vachon said, negative margin may be your best bet.Alternatively, you can use calc() to fix the problem.CSS:Just add whatever margin you take off or the width will be too narrow (100% isn't wide enough).Use negative margins and a container with positive padding.Just make sure that you have substantial content for it to stretch the table to 100% width, or else it'll be 20px too narrow.More info: svachon.com/blog/inside-only-css-table-border-spacing/use margin-left: -10px; to remove left padding but in the right there will be 20px padding.

Let say div is assigned two styles using addClass method. If style1 has 3 properties like font-size, weight and color, and style2 has 4 properties like font-size, weight, color and background-color, the resultant effective properties set (style), i think, will have 4 properties i.e. union of all style sets. Common properties, in our case, color,font-size, weight, will have one occuerance with latest values. If div is assigned style1 first and style2 second, the common prpoerties will be overwritten by style2 values.

I have the benefit of being able to throw a ton of javascript at the problem, but since you're already using a bit, consider the following for a gracefully degrading solution: On removal of any component/dom node, add a class called 'removing'.Then in the css you can define your animation using that class:And back in the javascript, just after you add the 'removing' class, you should be able to check for the 'animation' css property, and if it exists, then you know that you can hook on 'animationEnd' and if it doesn't, then just remove the element right away. I remember testing this a while back, it should work; I'll see if I can dig up the example code.Update: \nI've dug up this technique and started writing a really cool plugin for jQuery that allows you to use CSS3 animations for DOM elements that are being removed. No additional Javascript required: http://www.github.com/arthur5005/jquery.motionnotionIt's very experimental, use at your own risk, but would love some help and feedback. :)ideally for something like fadeIN and fadeOUT you should be using css transitions not css animations.."},

I am able to scroll it with mouse events but no luck with the keyboard so far.Update 2017As pointed out by @Wallop in the comments, the nav-index property was dropped from the spec in 2015 due to \"lack of implementation interest\".Take a look at the nav-index property introduced by W3C in CSS3-UI.This property has exactly the same behavior as a tabindex and is applicable to any element.Being probably the best standards-compliant solution for the use case, nav-index is interpreted only by Opera so far (as of June 2012) and is also marked as \"Feature at risk\" by W3C, therefore may be dropped any time.Alternative cross-browser solutions are:With respect to BoltClock´s point, I agree that the tabbing order is very logical (both the text selection order and tabbing order are closely related to the sequence in which elements are aranged in the document). On the other hand, CSS has a wider purpose today. It can manipulate not just the content of a document (content property) but also the behavior when and if events are to be fired: i.e. using pointer-events, display or z-index the pointer event's order will change. If these are very basic CSS properties, why you should not be able to influence KeyBoardEvents, too?This is a bit old but now there are css options like -moz-user-focus. I'm sure there is a webkit equivalent.https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/CSS/-moz-user-focususer-focus is the standard cross browser attribute."},

So, I tested out using 100vh instead of just setting it at 100% it seems that 100vh works really well across almost all browsers/devices. example: you want to only display the top div to the user before it scrolls, like a hero banner module. But, at the top of the page is a navbar which is 68px in height. The following doesn't work for me at all doing just %  There's was no change. The page just stayed the same. However, when swapping this to \"vh\" instead it works great! The div block you assign it too will stay on the viewer's device hight only. Until they decide to scroll down the page.Change the +/- to include how big your header is on the top. \nIf your navbar is say 120px in height then change 68px to 120px.Hope this helps anyone who cannot get this working with using normal height: calc();  try setting both html and body to height 100%;All the parent elements in the hierarchy should have height 100%. Just give max-height:100% to the element and max-height:calc(100% - 90px) to the immediate parent element. It worked for me on IE also.The Rendering in IE fails due to failure of Calc when the window is resized or data loaded in DOM. But this method mentioned above worked for me even in IE.You don't need to calculate anything, and probably shouldn't:I stuck it all together for brevity.If you are styling calc in a GWT project, its parser might not parse calc for you as it did not for me... the solution is to wrap it in a css literal like this:"},

I doubt it matters, but I'm using AngularJS. Thought I'd mention it in case there is a known conflict between Angular & Pseudo selectors (which I doubt).\nThanks.The issue is your use of absolute positioning & the method you're using to try and center it. If you position an element absolutely, the ol' margin: 0 auto; method won't work to center the thing. I point you to an explanation as to why this is at the end of the question, but in case you just want this to work let's get to the solution first.Here's some working code. View it on JSFiddleLet's break down what's going on here.In your original Fiddle, the pseudoelement is positioned absolutely relative to the viewport. An example might be the best way to show what this means, and why we don't want this. Consider setting it to top: 0. This would keep it latched to the top of the browser window (or, in this case, the JSFiddle frame), rather than the parent (the li). So, if our menu happened to be at the bottom of the page, or even moving around, the pseudoelement would be floating independent from it, stuck to the top of the page.This is the default behavior of an absolutely positioned element when you don't explicitly set the position on any parent elements. What we want is to have its position defined relative to the parent. If we do this then the pseudoelement sticks with the parent, no matter where it happens to be.To make this happen, you need to set the parent, #tool-menu li, to be explicitly positioned (which means setting it to be anything other than position: static). If you choose to use position: relative;, it won't change the computed location of the parent on the page, and does the thing we want. So that's why I used that one.In technical terms, what we're doing here is creating a new containing block for the child.Now that our absolute positioning will be determined in relation to the parent, we can take advantage of the fact that we can use percentages to define where to place the child. In this case, you want it centered, so I set it be left: 50%.If you do just this, though, you'll see that this lines up the left edge of the pseudoelement at 50%. This isn't what we want – we want the center of the pseudoelement to be at the middle. And that's why I added the negative margin-left. This scoots it over a bit to line the middle up with the center of the parent.And once we do that, it's centered! Brilliance!The auto value of a margin is calculated from a fairly complex algorithm. At times, it computes to 0. I know from experience that this is one such instance of that happening, though I haven't yet traced my way through the algorithm to see exactly why. If you'd like to run through it, take a look at the spec most browsers have most likely implemented.You can also use the calc function in css to center the pseudo element.Note: This isn't supported in IE8 and below (caniuse) but you can provide a fallback for older browsers. View it on this code pen. I'm also using MarkP's css border method to draw the triangle.Not directly related (have already voted up jmeas) but you may also find it easier to use the CSS border trick to make the triangle. e.g. Similar tactics as to what jmeas has suggested with regards to the vertical positioning.  We align to the bottom and then use a negative margin-bottom to push this out to the desired location.Wouldn't be better to just define the width as a percentage, make it a block element and text-align it in the center? \"float: center;\" is invalid, and won't work. Mixing floated and absolute positioned elements are a sure way to get trouble with your layout as they don't really work that well togheter.Try something like this:As long as the element has a width declared you can use the absolute centering  method.To use this method the right and left properties must be set to 0 for margin: auto to be effective.This method can be expanded to implement horizontal centering as well. see link for full info:http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2013/08/09/absolute-horizontal-vertical-centering-css/ With pesudo element :after or :before use display: inline-block;Try something like this:"},

They add 7 (!) new methods for that. Now ca. 20% of code from modal.js only try to handle that issues.Try this:It is actually caused by the following rule in bootstrap.css:I am not exactly sure why it behaves like that (perhaps to account for scrollbar somehow) but you can change the behaviour with this:EDIT: Actually, this is a reported issue in bootstrap: https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/issues/9855When the model opens, a padding of 17px to the right of the body. The code below should resolve that issue.    Here's the fix proposed by user yshing that really FIXED it for me while using Bootstrap v3.1.1 and Google Chrome 35.0.1916.114m. The fix comes from a GitHub issue thread regarding this matter:The fix will land only in Bootstrap 3.2 as desbribed by mdo.To prevent the page from shifting in similar instances - for example an accordion opening that goes past the bottom of the page - I add this in CSS:The overflow-y: scroll forces the scrollbar to present at all times. To be honest, I can't remember why I put height:100% in there... but you don't seem to require it for this problem.Demo: http://jsfiddle.net/jxX6A/8/There is still a little movement. But that seems to be present on Bootstrap's own example page: http://getbootstrap.com/javascript/#modalsSo I'm guessing you're stuck with it... but it's still far better than what you were seeing initially.EDIT: I might be concerned that adding these styles would interfere with other Bootstrap stuff, as I haven't used it myself, so you might want to double check on that.You just edit .modal-open class form bootstrap.min.css file, I thin it's will be ok         .modal-open{overflow:auto}The over-flow:hidden is set there , you just set over-flow:auto .i have faced same problem and following solutionA lot has changed since bootstrap 3.3.6 so the solutions above may not suffice.To solve this, look at the setScrollbar function in bootstrap.js (or bootstrap-min.js of course), you will immediately notice that bootstrap is adding padding-right to the body element setting its value to a worked out value of scrollbarWidth plus existing padding-right on the body (or 0 if not).If you comment out the belowIn your css override bootstrap modal-open class with the belowFolks have suggested overflow-y: scroll; the problem with this is that your content shifts if scroll bar does not exists in the first place.NB\nAs per http://getbootstrap.com/javascript/#modals, always try to place a modal's HTML code in a top-level position in your documentI have same problem and I got solution that is work for me....place this code at top of your style.css fileFound this answer in TB issues just by adding this below css that small movement will be fixedCredits to https://github.com/tvararuI use Bootstrap v3.3.4 and see this problem, I understood that Bootstrap modal add 17px padding right to the body, so just simply use following code:No solution here fixed my issue. But following Css I got from Github worked for me.Just do this simply and thats allWorks for me. Short and does the job.This is a reported issue to bootstrap: https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/issues/9855And this is my temporary quick fix and it's work using fixed top navbar, only using javascript. Load this script along with your page.Here is the working example: http://jsbin.com/oHiPIJi/64i have faced same problem and following solution works for meTry to change all occurence of below withon your bootstrap.js file.That's All..Simply add a class it worked for me I fixed my problem and I think it will work for everyone.\nIn bootstrap.js there's a line:if (this.bodyIsOverflowing) this.$body.css('padding-right', bodyPad + this.scrollbarWidth)It means in some case Bootstrap will add a padding-right of scrollbar width while opening a modal. So @pmanOnu was half way right, but don't delete this whole line of code but only replace bodyPad + this.scrollbarWidth in bootstrap.js with 0to make Bootstrap adding a padding-right of 0px (which is the same of not adding).Then add .modal-open {overflow: initial;} to your custom css to prevent Bootstrap from disabling scrollbar while opening modals.If all the above solutions didn't work , it may be because of positioning the content ,Just take a look at the position of the modal So it turns out I was actually getting right margin of 250px or so.  My problem seemed to be that .modal-open was getting set to position: fixed, and that was the cause for whatever reason.  So in my case, the fix was similar, but I set the position value to the default as below:For anyone still struggling with this - the latest version of Bootstrap has a native fix. Just update the bootstrap.min.css and bootstrap.min.js files from the latest version.http://getbootstrap.com/I really didn't like any of the solutions provided, and used a combination of them (along with a fix I previously had for qTip modals) to come up with something that worked best for me with Bootstrap v3.3.7.UPDATE:  Resolved issue with fixed navbar positioning on iOS.CSS:JavaScript:This allows the background to be \"fixed\" yet still allows the modals to be scrollable, resolves the issue of double scrollbar and the repositioning of the fixed navbar.Note that there is additional code there as well to remember the 'scroll' position (and return to it) when the modal is closed.Hope this helps anyone else looking to achieve what I was going after. I found the answer by Agni Pradharma working for me; however not entirely in Chrome.It appears the document scrollbar is wider than another elements scrollbar; so I edited the getScrollBarWidth function.It simply first checks the width; removes the document scrollbar; then compares the difference. It also happens to be much less code.Here's what I used, will work 100% in Bootstrap 3.2.0 as long as you don't mind forcing scrollbars.the best way is:\nto add to BODY overflow-y: scrolland remove 4 function from bootstrap.js -For me it works fine like thisFor me the following seems to work - tested in Firefox and Chrome on Linux:This worked for me. Overrides the 17px padding added to the right of the body:    I tweaked this answer further up this thread by TBAGWith a minor tweak it works on the desktop, for mobile devices overflow is set to hiddenfinal codeHope this helps!"},

Any help would be greatly appreciated.As far as I know, display: inline-block is what you probably need. That will make it seem like it's sort of inline but still allow you to use things like margins and such.If you are coming here, there is high chance width: min-content or width: max-content can fix your problem. This can force an element to use the smallest or largest space the browser could choose…This is the modern solution. Here is a small tutorial for that.There is also fit-content, which often works like min-content, but is more flexible. (But also has worse browser support.) This is a quite new feature and some browsers do not support it yet, but browser support is growing. See the current browser status here.If display: inline; isn't working, try out display: inline-block;. :)h2 { display: inline }The best way to do this is to set display: inline;.

{"title": "Why doesn't “margin: auto” center an element vertically?", "author": "Stickers", "date": "2015-12-31 22:30:29Z", "question": "As you can see in the demo below, margin: auto; centers the blue div horizontally, but not vertically. Why not?My question is not asking for workarounds.", "url": "[Why doesn't “margin: auto” center an element vertically?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/34552116/why-doesnt-margin-auto-center-an-element-vertically)", "vote": 47, "content": "As you can see in the demo below, margin: auto; centers the blue div horizontally, but not vertically. Why not?My question is not asking for workarounds.As mentioned, this behavior is specified in section 10.6.2 of CSS2.1, and has remained unchanged from CSS2.Block boxes are stacked vertically from top to bottom in normal flow. Furthermore, vertical margins may collapse, and only do so under certain circumstances (in your demo, the border on the parent element will prevent any margins on the child element from collapsing with its own). If you only have one such block box, and the height of the containing block is auto, then its top and bottom margins will be zero anyway. But if you have more than one block box in the same flow, or even out-of-flow boxes affecting the layout of in-flow boxes (in the case of clearance for example), how would you expect auto margins to resolve for those in-flow boxes?This is why auto left and right margins are likewise zeroed out for inline elements (including atomic inlines) and floats (though horizontal margins never collapse). Inline-level boxes are laid along line boxes, and floats too obey unique layout rules.Absolutely positioned boxes are a different story: since they are never aware of any other boxes in the same positioning context as themselves, auto top and bottom margins can be calculated for them with respect to their containing blocks without having to worry about any other boxes ever interfering.Flexbox is also a different story: what sets flex layout apart from block layout is that flex items are by definition always aware of other flex items in the same flex formatting context, including the fact that there are none. In particular, neither can floats intrude into the flex container, nor can you float flex items to subvert this (although you can still remove a child element from flex layout completely with absolute positioning). Margins behave very differently with flex items due in part to this. See sections 4.2, 9.5 and 9.6.Why...because the W3C spec says so.As to the actual \"why\"...the query should really be addressed there.It doesn't center the element vertically because it is a block-level element in the normal flow. Thus, the following rule applies:It's also worth pointing out that the rule above also applies to the following elements as well: (see points 10.6.2 and 10.6.3 for more information and conditions).With that being said, absolutely positioned, non-replaced elements that don't have top, height, and bottom values of auto are an exception to this rule. The following applies from point 10.6.4:See the example below demonstrating how an absolutely positioned element is vertically centered using margin: auto. It works because none of the three properties top, height, and bottom have a value of auto:In addition, it's probably worth pointing out the following rule as well:This means that if the absolutely positioned element has a margin-top value of auto and a margin-bottom value of 0 (i.e., margin: auto auto 0), the element would be absolutely positioned at the bottom relative to the parent like in the example below:Actually, it does – just not for every display value. If display is flex, margin: auto centers both vertically and horizontally.The same applies to display: inline-flex, display: grid and display: inline-grid. It's because of the actual possibility of knowing the true height of the element in which you want to center vertically in. To understand that, first think about how auto horizontal centering works. You have a div which you've given it a width (fixed or percentage). The width can be calculated to certain degree. If it's fixed width, great. If it's flexible or responsive (percentage) at least you have a range that the width will cover before it hits the next breakpoint. You take that width, minus whatever it's inside and split the remainder on both sides.Now, with that information, how could the browser calculate the infinite amount of variations in which your div will grow vertically? Keep in mind the size of the element, wrapping of text, paddings, and responsiveness will also alter the width and force the text to wrap further, and on, and on it goes. Is it an impossible task? Not really, has CSS spent time and effort covering this? Not worth their time, I guess. And that is basically the answer I tell my students. But....fret not! Bootstrap v4 alpha has figured out vertical centering! EDITSorry to edit this late but I thought you may want to consider this solutions to center vertically and it is pretty simple by making use of the calc function See it HERE"},

Why is part of square displayed?Tested browsers:This is not a bug and is actually how it's supposed to work. It's a bit confusing as the elaborate description of Stacking Contexts doesn't mention anything about it. However, the visual formatting module links to the color module where this particular gotcha can be found (emphasis mine):It's not a problem of opacity being more important than z-index, rather than z-index being relative to their stacking context (see z-index in the CSS2 specification).In other words, z-index are only significant within the context of a positioned ancestor (whether its relative, absolute or fixed). What you need to do to fix your problem is add a position: relative; to the element that contain both your popup and your navy square, and probably add it a z-index: 1; . Seeing your screenshot it will probably be a top element such as a wrapper div.Workaround for two elements, like divs: add a 0.99 opacity to your top element, and the order of both is reestablished.Example code might be needed to debug this problem.You might put overflow: hidden and possibly position: relative in a DIV which surrounds all the editor objects to try to force the elements to only be drawn within that DIV, e.g:As a last resort, you could also try a iframe in between the two elements to try to stop them seeping through.You might try to set the popup window's DIV like this using !important so the style doesn't change on applying new style or class:Then, make new CSS class:And add class to all elements in the window, like this for example:My guess is that this would work, since there is no priority in applying CSS attributes... as far as I know. =)I had the same issue. Using rgba instead of color/opacity solved my problem. Working with LESS (in the Bootstrap framework), the fade() function did the conversion for me.Although @Guillaume Esquevin already gave a great answer, I will try to expand on it in case someone ignores what a stacking context is (like I did).As you can read here, there is something called stacking context, which refers to a group of elements sharing a parent that move together in the stack. An example could be a div and all its children.There are three ways to create a stacking context: in the root of the document (the html element), by positioning the parent element, and by changing the opacity of the parent to something lower than 1.Then, if you have a div with opacity lower than 1 and you want some sibling element of this div to appear behind it (and its children), you can create a new stacking context on such sibling by setting its position to relative or by changing its opacity as well."},

Is there any way to use CSS to blur the background of a semitransparent element instead of its contents?OCT. 2016 UPDATESince the -moz-element() property doesn't seem to be widely supported by other browsers except to FF, there's an even easier technique to apply blurring without affecting the contents of the container. The use of pseudoelements is ideal in this case in combination with svg blur filter.Check the demo using pseudo-element(Demo was tested in FF v49, Chrome v53, Opera 40 - IE doesn't seem to support blur either with css or svg filter)The only way (so far) of having a blur effect in the background without js plugins, is the use of -moz-element() property in combination with the svg blur filter. With -moz-element() you can define an element as a background image of another element. Then you apply the svg blur filter. OPTIONAL: You can utilize some jQuery for scrolling if your background is in fixed position.See my demo hereI understand it is a quite complicated solution and limited to FF (element() applies only to Mozilla at the moment with -moz-element() property) but at least there's been some effort in the past to implement in webkit browsers and hopefully it will be implemented in the future.In recent versions of major browsers you can use backdrop-filter property.HTMLCSSor if you need different background color for browsers without support:Demo: JSFiddleDocs: Mozilla Developer: backdrop-filterIs it for me?: CanIUseYou can use a pseudo-element to position as the background of the content with the same image as the background, but blurred with the new CSS3 filter.You can see it in action here: http://codepen.io/jiserra/pen/JzKpxI made that for customizing a select, but I added the blur background effect.There is a simple and very common technique by using 2 background images: a crisp and a blurry one. You set the crisp image as a background for the body and the blurry one as a background image for your container. The blurry image must be set to fixed positioning and the alignment is 100% perfect. I used it before and it works.You can see a working example at the following fiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/jTUjT/5/. Try to resize the browser and see that the alignment never fails.If only CSS element() was supported by other browsers other than Mozilla's -moz-element() you could create great effects. See this demo with Mozilla.Use an empty element sized for the content as the background, and position the content over the blurred element.The background element can be inside of the content element, but not the other way around.This is not easy if the content is not always consistently sized, but it works.You could make it through iframes... I made something, but my only problem for now is syncing those divs to scroll simultaneous... its terrible way, because its like you load 2 websites, but the only way I found... you could also work with divs and overflow I guess...In which way do you want it dynamic? If you want the popup to successfully map to the background, you need to create two backgrounds. It requires both the use of element() or -moz-element() and a filter (for Firefox, use a SVG filter like filter: url(#svgBlur) since Firefox does not support -moz-filter: blur() as yet?). It only works in Firefox at the time of writing.See demo here.I still need to create a simple demo to show how it is done. You're welcome to view the source."},

And when you define font-size in CSS, do you use px, pt or em?http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/syndata.html#length-units describes those and the other length units available in CSSAs a rule of thumb, use percentages on screen and pt for print.CSS Length Units:Points are standard typographical measurements that have been used by printers and typesetters for decades and by word-processing programs for many years. Traditionally, there are 72 points to an inch (points were defined before widespread use of the metric system). Therefore, the capital letters of text set to 12 points should be one-sixth of an inch tall. For example, p {font-size: 18pt;} is equivalent to p {font-size: 0.25in;}.Picas are another typographical term. A pica is equivalent to 12 points, which means there are 6 picas to an inch. As just shown, the capital letters of text set to 1 pica should be one-sixth of an inch tall. For example, p {font-size: 1.5pc;} would set text to the same size as the example declarations found in the definition of points.These units are really useful only if the browser knows all the details of the monitor on which your page is displayed, the printer you're using, or whatever other user agent might apply. On a web browser, display is affected by the size of the monitor and the resolution to which the monitor is setand there isn't much that you, as the author, can do about these factors. absolute units are much more useful in defining style sheets for printed documents, where measuring things in terms of inches, points, and picas is common. As you've seen, attempting to use absolute measurements in web design is perilous at best.em: one \"em\" is defined to be the value of font-size for a given font. If the font-size of an element is 14 pixels, then for that element, 1em is equal to 14 pixels.ex: refers to the height of a lowercase x in the font being used. Therefore, if you have two paragraphs in which the text is 24 points in size, but each paragraph uses a different font, then the value of ex could be different for each paragraph. This is because different fonts have different heights for x px: tiny boxes of color in a monitor are pixels. In general, if you declare something like font-size: 18px, a web browser will almost certainly use actual pixels on your monitor after all, they're already there but with other display devices, like printers, the user agent will have to rescale pixel lengths to something more sensible. In other words, the printing code has to figure out how many dots there are in a pixel, and to do so, it may use the 96ppi reference pixel.ConclutionBecause of this potential for rescaling, pixels are defined as a relative unit of measurement, even though, in web design, they behave much like absolute units.Rrefrence: css the definite guid by eric meyer em : The em is a scalable unit that is used in web document media. An em is equal to the current font-size, for instance, if the font-size of the document is 12pt, 1em is equal to 12pt.px : Pixels are fixed-size units that are used in screen media (i.e. to be read on the computer screen). One pixel is equal to one dot on the computer screen (the smallest division of your screen’s resolution). pt : Points are traditionally used in print media (anything that is to be printed on paper, etc.). One point is equal to 1/72 of an inch. Points are much like pixels, in that they are fixed-size units and cannot scale in size."},

The solution is to have the menu open below and somewhat to the right, see the \"position\" option in the menu invocation."},

From this answer, from @Mario - It depends on the packaging. If your Maven project is WAR - put it in the webapp directory. You can choose to use subfolders within the webapp directory ie: webapp/css/main.css or put the file directly within the webapp directory ie: webapp/main.css.If you are using JAR, put in the resources directory.

In fact, the html element will take on the background of body if you don't give it its own background, and html will pass this on to the canvas:That said, however, you can superimpose any background image over a background color on a single element (either html or body), without having to rely on two elements — simply use background-color and background-image or combine them in the background shorthand property:If you wish to combine two background images, you need to rely on multiple backgrounds.

In our style sheet, suppose we specify that your <div> is to be displayed as table:Upon loading your page, the <div> is displayed as table. If you want to hide this <div> with scripting, you might do any of these:All of thse have the same effect: adding an inline style property to your <div>:If you wish to show the element again, any of these would work:These remove the display CSS property from the inline style property:Since the inline style no longer specifies a display, the <div> goes back to being displayed as table, since that's what we put in the style sheet. The <div> does not revert to being displayed as block because our CSS overrode that default setting; blanking out the inline display property does not negate the rules in our style sheets.For giggles, here's the Google query I used for verification of my answer: javascript style display empty string default...and a couple of links where this is mentioned:http://jszen.blogspot.com/2004/07/table-rowsrevealed.htmlhttp://www.harrymaugans.com/2007/03/05/how-to-create-a-collapsible-div-with-javascript-and-css/ \n(not in the article, but in the comments section)It sets the display style to the default value for that element. For most elements if not all, the default value is something other than none.It removes the value for the display property so that the default value is used.It does not reset the original display property.If you for example have this:And do this:the display style used for the element ends up being inline because that's the default for the element, it is not reset back to the style specified in the HTML code.It sets the css for that element's display to null  which essentially wipes out what was set and it reverts to its default value."},

How can I just use the bootstrap.less as reference for compiling?The core question you ask is For LESS 1.5 it is now possible to import a file purely as a reference. Like so:No actual code will output from that file as CSS, but all becomes available to use as mixins. [DISCLAIMER: it is uncertain if this would work as of 1.3.3, but this original answer I do believe has some usefulness in later versions as well. However, for truly getting what the OP wanted, the new capability in LESS 1.5 is recommended.]Current versions of LESS (1.3.3) can accommodate this through the use of a namespace. Like so:By making the namespace a mixin (the addition of the parentheses after the name), it will still import the file (I know of no way to access it externally without importing), but it should not compile the actual bootstrap code into your final css file output. What this technique should do is allow you access to bootstrap's classes, mixins, etc., through the namespace call #bootstrapRef >, making it possible to use those in your own defined classes, etc.I have not fully tested if there are any bugs to this, it should just work theoretically.Doing this in LESS is a bit tricky but can be achieved like so:resulting in some additional classes being declared from mixins.less and variables.less. Mostly just .clearfix and then all of the .btn classes are added to input#submitSee the long output here:http://pastebin.com/ZBAZZ3kSI'm not sure if there is a tool for import only current referring css rules inside an external file, but Boostrap has a very organized structure, so check if the styles you are looking for are on mixins.less, so you don't have to import the entire bootstrap.less file.Also, check this related question, there are some good Best Practices for customize Boostrap.EDIT: As @PavloMykhalov suggest, maybe is better to look at buttons.lessNote: It will be awesome a tool for this sort of things. Some day I will work on thatDon't know what made you believe that LESS currently supports that, for this to be possible the option must be a lot more explicit, it currently really simply imports, parses, saves chunks, executes chunks into output text. Unless there is nothing explicit to stop this sequence, it will not do it any differently. I have just logged a feature request under LESS, don't know for sure if this has been requested before though, searched and found nothing, hope I don't get slapped for repetition! https://github.com/cloudhead/less.js/issues/1169UPDATE\nThe issues turned out to be a duplicate, the issue open is here: https://github.com/cloudhead/less.js/issues/622"},

Although this technique may still be useful if you don't specifically want to darken the image, but instead want to highlight it on hover/focus/other state for whatever reason.Easy asif you want only the background-image to be affected, you can use a linear gradient to do that, just like this:If you want it darker, make the alpha value higher, else you want it lighter, make alpha lowerI would make a new image of the dog's silhouette (black) and the rest the same as the original image. In the html, add a wrapper div with this silhouette as as background. Now, make the original image semi-transparent. The dog will become darker and the background of the dog will stay the same.

After several hours of looking and troubleshooting this worked:All I can think of is that something is over-riding this afterwards.You are including the reset styles first, right?In IE I just use a class \"normal_ol\" for styling an ol list and made some modifications shown below:previous code:\nol.normal_ol { float:left; padding:0 0 0 25px; margin:0; width:500px;}\nol.normal_ol li{  font:normal 13px/20px Arial; color:#4D4E53; float:left; width:100%;}modified code:\nol.normal_ol { float:left; padding:0 0 0 25px; margin:0;}\nol.normal_ol li{  font:normal 13px/20px Arial; color:#4D4E53; }All you have to do is add this class to your css. Including the padding and margin set at 0 is extremely important. Trust me. Turns out that YUI's reset CSS strips the list style from 'ul li' instead of just 'ul', which is why setting it just in 'ul' never worked."},

This will work on pretty much every browser ever. The leading space is important, because the className property treats the css classes like a single string, which ought to match the class attribute on HTML elements (where multiple classes must be separated by spaces). Incidentally, you're going to be better off using a Javascript library like prototype or jQuery, which have methods to do this, as well as functions that can first check if an element already has a class assigned.In prototype, for instance:See how much nicer that is?!Adding class using element's classList property:Removing:classList is a convenient alternative to accessing an element's list of classes.. see http://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element.classList.Not supported in IE < 10When an element already has a class name defined, its influence on the element is tied to its position in the string of class names. \nLater classes override earlier ones, if there is a conflict.Adding a class to an element ought to move the class name to the sharp end of the list, if it exists already.You should be able to set the className property of the element.

It may alter or proxy some strings that you pass to .css(), but in reality there was no work put in from the jQuery team to allow either string to be passed.  There's no extra resources used because the DOM does the work.I think it is so it can keep consistency with the available options used when settings multiple css styles in one function call through the use of an object, for example...as you can see the property are not specified as strings. JQuery also supports using string if you still wanted to use the dash, or for properties that perhaps cannot be set without the dash, so the following still works...without the quotes here, the javascript would not parse correctly as property names cannot have a dash in them.EDIT: It would appear that JQuery is not actually making the distinction itsleft, instead it is just passing the property specified for the DOM to care about, most likely with style[propertyName];Late to answer, but no-one has specified that css property with dash won't work in object declaration in jquery:So, do not forget to use quotes if you prefer to use dash style property in jquery code.when is marginLeft being used:As you can see, attributes that has a hyphen on it are converted to camelcased format. Using the margin-left from the previous code block above would make JavaScript bonkers because it will treat the hyphen as an operation for subtraction.when is margin-left used:Theoretically, both code blocks will do the same thing. We can allow hyphens on the second block because it is a string value while compared to the first block, it is somewhat an object.\n\nNow that should make sense.jQuery is simply supporting the way CSS is written.Also, it ensures that no matter how a browser returns a value, it will be understood Hi i tried this it is working."},

I would speculate that whoever is responsible for those styles increments it every time there is a change. It's because the browser sees a different URL in the style field, so it will grab the latest version, even though it's technically in the same place on the server.As helpfully pointed out in the comments, css files often have their expiry set well into the future, this method is a nice sidestep to cache related headers.Quite a useful trick.It is to make the browser think it is a new file every-time to it refreshes its cache.Very useful when your stylesheets change regularly..."},

I have added my sample code in jsfidle:http://jsfiddle.net/koolkabin/yawYM/The problem i am facing is that when we rotate the text then it breaks the alignment and positions... so what is causing that and how can i manage them?You need to use the CSS3 transform property rotate - see here for which browsers support it and the prefix you need to use.One example for webkit browsers is -webkit-transform: rotate(-90deg);Edit: The question was changed substantially so I have added a demo that works in Chrome/Safari (as I only included the -webkit- CSS prefixed rules). The problem you have is that you do not want to rotate the title div, but simply the text inside it. If you remove your rotation, the <div>s are in the correct position and all you need to do is wrap the text in an element and rotate that instead.There already exists a more customisable widget as part of the jQuery UI - see the accordion demo page. I am sure with some CSS cleverness you should be able to make the accordion vertical and also rotate the title text :-)Edit 2: I had anticipated the text center problem and have already updated my demo. There is a height/width constraint though, so longer text could still break the layout.Edit 3: It looks like the horizontal version was part of the original plan but I cannot see any way of configuring it on the demo page. I was incorrect… the new accordion is part of the upcoming jQuery UI 1.9! So you could try the development builds if you want the new functionality.Hope this helps!In your case, it's the best to use rotate option from transform property as mentioned before. There is also writing-mode property and it works like rotate(90deg) so in your case, it should be rotated after it's applied. Even it's not the right solution in this case but you should be aware of this property.

I would prefer if I don't have to add additional html to the page. I want the image to appear in front of the element rather than behind. What's the best way to do this?To achieve a \"foreground image\" without extra HTML code, you can use a pseudo-element (::before / :before) plus the CSS pointer-events. The last property is needed so that the user can actually click through the layer \"as if it did not exists\".Here's an example (using a color whose alpha channel is 50% so that you can see that the real elements can actually be focused): http://jsfiddle.net/JxNdT/PS. I picked the ::before pseudo-element, because that naturally leads to the correct positioning. If I pick ::after, then I have to add position:relative; to the real element (#cont), and top:0;left:0; to the pseudo-element (::after).PPS. To get the foreground effect on elements without a fixed size, an additional element is needed. This wrapper element requires the position:relative;display:inline-block; styles. Set the width and height of the pseudo-element to 100%, and the pseudo-element will stretch to the width and height of the wrapper element. Demo: http://jsfiddle.net/JxNdT/1/.You can use this cssNOTESet the z-index to index greater the the z-index of the element over which you are putting the image.If you have not specified any z-index then 1 would do the work.You can also set z-index to -1,in that case the image would always be at background!If you need a white-transparent foregroundThis is for future visitors like me who are considering adding a white-transparent foreground to an element to communicate that it's hidden / disabled for instance. You can often achieve your goal by simply lowering the opacity below 1:A neat solution: box-sizing + padding-left, see more at css-tricksSomewhere in your HTML:The CSS for replacing the image (on hovering)"},

But if you're using classes for user-interaction then it can be useful to know.You can also use as many classes as needed on a tag, but an id must be unique to the document.\nAlso be careful of using too many divs, when another more semantic tag can do the job.Of course you can.Your HTML there is just fine. To style the elements with css you can use the following approaches:Also you can add as many classes as you wish to your elementAnd you can style that element using a selector with any combination of the classes and id. \nFor example:That's HTML, but yes, you can bang pretty much any selectors you like together.(And the HTML is fine too)Yes, in one single division you can use both but it's not very common. While styling you will call both so it will cause some ambiguity if you don't properly choose \"x\" and \"y\".\nUse # for ID and . for class. And for overall division you will either do separate styling or write:  #x .y for styling purposes.Yes, why not? Then CSS that applies to class \"x\" AND CSS that applies to ID \"y\" applies to the div.If you want to target a specific class and ID in CSS, then use a format like div.x#y {}.#y.x should work. And it's convenient too. You can make a page with different kinds of output. You can give a certain element an id, but give it different classes depending on the look you want.Yes you can.You just need to understand what they are for, the class is more general and can be used several times, the id (is like your id's) you can use it only once.This excellent tutorial  helped me with that:The Difference Between ID and ClassThough it's not an exact answer to your question I'm sure it will help you a lot!Good luck!EDIT: Reading your question, I just want to clarify that:And that if you want to \"use them\" in CSS for styling purposes you should do as David Says: #x.y { }"},

I don't need reading about colors, etc, I just need to learn how to do layout in HTML/CSS like I do in Java/Swing or other similar frameworks.Let me preface this by saying that I prefer to look up reference material online as needed (I store my knowledge in the cloud) rather than learning by heart an entire book on css properties that could appear to be completely out of context; at the same time I find it more beneficial to read deep into higher-level theory and guides, be it feature articles or books. Have you been given a comprehensive styleguide or maybe even a few mockups and it's now up to you to make it into html+css? In this case I'd suggestIf you want to dig deeper and have better understanding of design principles and usability concepts behind a successful product, or if you are yet to come up with wireframes/page mockups etc., the reading list expands:And remember stackoverflow - if you've come across an issue, somebody probably has already solved it :)I recommend reading http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/internals/howbrowserswork/.It's not a small article. It's a very detailled, well-thought article, describing several aspects of the browser. The following may interest you:If you want to know how CSS layout work. There a good tutorial by google http://code.google.com/edu/submissions/html-css-javascript/& as you said that you are know what is CSS. So, is better to learn how to avoid common mistakes did by beginners. there are several go articles on that. There are few :http://sixrevisions.com/css/12-common-css-mistakes-web-developers-make/http://webdesignledger.com/tips/the-most-common-html-and-css-mistakes-to-avoidhttp://www.designdetector.com/2006/06/ten-common-css-mistakes.phpI would suggest you take a look at this tutorial It's a 30 days HTML/CSS Course of Jeffrey Way, he explains everything you need very good and in an nice way and what's the best about it, it is free (you need to register for a free account, currently at the top right corner).Alternative:But there are many many many resources for learning html and css on the web.Anything you want to know about html/css is on W3C CSS Tricks also have some good reading materialI prefer text books. You can use postit notes to put page markers in them (any you can read them on the toilet!).As to one for CSS - CSS The missing manual I have found quite goodHTML - The Nutshell books (that I have always found good) is a good one.Just go read up on how the DOM (document object model) works. Most important thing to know is that the html code is parsed from top down, and that is where your knowledge of position elements will also come in handy. Building a layout will be very easy with this in mind, and also if you keep a grid-like structure in mind. Also read up on best practices for accessibility.I've also read some good technical articles/tutorials/etc on the IBM developerworks site.Everything you need is on Google, I think it's just a matter of using the right keywords :)"},

It can be used with other document types, not only with HTML, it can be used with SVG for example.From the specification (emphasis mine):One technical difference between them is that :root - being a pseudo class has a greater specificity than html (a type selector)So, in the above example, the :root selector overrides the html selector and the text appears red.For HTML documents, there is no difference - your root element is the <html> tag, so html{} and :root{} are (besides from a difference in specificity) semantically equivalent. However, you can apply CSS not only to HTML, but all XML-like documents. That's why :root is there - to target the document's root element regardless of document type. Most people are confused by the difference because the overwhelmingly predominant use case for CSS is styling HTML documents.Example:\nYou can style SVG documents with CSS. When styling it, your root element will (obviously;-)) not be html but svg. See the following list of SVG tags."},

For single left angle quote, use &lsaquo;From the description and from the reference to the search box in the Ubuntu site, I gather that you actually want an arrowhead character pointing to the right. There are no Unicode characters designed to be used as arrowheads, but some of them may visually resemble an arrowhead.In particular, if you draw your idea of the character at Shapecatcher.com, you will find many suggestions, such as “〉” RIGHT-POINTING ANGLE BRACKET' (U+232A) and “❭” MEDIUM RIGHT-POINTING ANGLE BRACKET ORNAMENT (U+276D).Such characters generally have limited support in fonts, so you would need to carefully write a longish font-family list or to use a downloadable font. See my Guide to using special characters in HTML.Especially if the intended use is as a symbol in a search box, as the reference to the Ubuntu page suggests, it is questionable whether you should use a character at all. It’s not really an element of text here; rather, a graphic symbol that accompanies text but isn’t a part of it. So why take all the trouble with using a character (safely), when it isn’t really a character?I use ▸ (0x25B8) for the right arrow, often to show a collapsed list; and I pair it with ▾ (0x25BE) to show the list opened up.

This is basically doing what height: 100% does when applied to the body or html but you don't get the side effect of having your backgrounds cut off when scrolling (past 100% page height) like you do with a 100% height on those elements. I can sleep now =]I had the same issue on a couple of sites and fixed it by moving the background styling from body to html (which I guess is a variation of the body {} to html, body{} technique already mentioned but shows that you can make do with the style on html only), e.g.becomesThis worked in IE6-8, Chrome 4-5, Safari 4, Opera 10 and Firefox 3.x with no obvious nasty side-effects.I was able to fix this with:HTML and body height 100% doesn't work in older IE versions.You have to move the backgroundproperties from the body element to the html element.\nThat will fix it crossbrowser.Simple, correct, solution - define the background image and colour in html, not body.  Unless you've defined a specific height (not a percentage) in the body, its height will be assumed to be as tall as required to hold all content.  so your background styling should go into html, which is the entire html document, not just the body.  Simples.After trying all of the other solutions here without success, I skeptically tried the solution found in this article, and got it to work.Essentially, it boils down to removing @charset \"utf-8\"; from your CSS.This seems like a poor implementation in DreamWeaver - but it did fix the issue for me, regardless.I am not sure 100%, but try to replace selector with \"html, body\":I would try what Logan and 1mdm suggested, tho tweak the CSS, but I would really wait for a new Chrome version to come out with fixed bugs, before growing white hair.  IMHO the current Chrome version is still alpha version and was released so that it can spread while it is in development. I personally had issues with table widths, my code worked fine in EVERY browser but could not make it work in Chrome.  Google Chrome and safari needs a tweak for body and background issues.\nWe have use additional identifier as mentioned below.Use both body and #body identifier and enter same styles in both.\nMake the body tag with id attribute of body.This works for me.Adam's chromeFix solution with Paul Alexander's pure-CSS modification solved the problem in Chrome, but not in Safari.  A couple additional tweaks solved the problem in Safari, too: width: 100% and z-index:-1 (or some other appropriate negative value that puts this element behind all the other elements on the page).The CSS:I had the same thing in both Chrome and Safari aka Webkit browsers. I'm suspecting it's not a bug, but the incorrect use of css which 'breaks' the background.In the Question above, the body background property is set to:Which is fine, but not entirely correct. There's no image background, thus...I'm seen this problem with Chrome too, if I remember correctly if you minimize and then maximize your window it fixes it as well?Haven't really used Chrome too much since it was released but this is definitely something I blame on Google as the code I was checking it on was air tight.Everybody has said your code is fine, and you know it works on other browsers without problems. So it's time to drop the science and just try stuff :)Try putting the background color IN the body tag itself instead of/as-well-as in the CSS. Maybe insist again (redudantly) in Javascript. At some point, Chrome will have to place the background as you want it every time. Might be a timing-interpreting issue...[Should any of this work, of course, you can toggle it on the server-side so the funny code only shows up in Chrome. And in a few months, when Chrome has changed and the problem disappears... well, worry about that later.]It must be a WebKit issue as it is in both Safari 4 and Chrome.I'm pretty sure this is a bug in Chrome. Most likely it happens if you resize the browser TO full screen, then switch tabs. And sometimes if you just switch tabs/open a new one. Good to hear you found a \"fix\" though.SourceWorked for me :)Here is how I ended up solving the problem:This was the actual issue, clearly the body tag defined in CSS was not picked up.My environment: Chrome Browser/Safari, First time when it does not work, So according to the thread recommendation here I ended up adding the css file with the html entrySample CSS file: mystyle.cssSample html file:After the first loading it will work in Chrome and then go back to CSS file comment the html entry, so your modified CSS will be Clearly seems to be bug in webkit, Saw the same behavior in Safari as well.

In fact, interpolation is one of the main features of custom properties.But you cannot do this with url(), as url(var(--url)) is parsed not as a url( function token followed by var(--url) followed by a ), but a single url() token that is invalid because the var(--url) is being treated as a URL itself, and unquoted URLs in url() tokens cannot contain parentheses unless they are escaped. This means the substitution never actually occurs, because the parser never sees any var() expressions in the property value — indeed, your background declaration is completely invalid.If you didn't understand any of that, that's fine. Just know that you cannot use var() interpolation with url() due to legacy reasons.Even though the problem depicted in the question is related to the legacy url() token, you cannot do this by building URL tokens out of several var() expressions either, in case you were thinking of trying something like --uo: url(; --uc: ); or --uo: url(\"; --uc: \");, and background: var(--uo) var(--url) var(--uc);. This is because custom properties cannot contain unmatched string delimiters or parts of url() tokens (called bad URL tokens).If you want to specify a URL in a custom property, you need to write out the entire url() expression, and substitute that entire expression:Or, use JavaScript instead of var() to perform the interpolation.I had the same issue on a project with cordova so i used:Apparently if you use url(\"\") with double quotes on the --var declaration, the value will not work."},

It's inspired by Ryan Florences Magic Move demo https://github.com/FormidableLabs/react-shuffleI realise this is a bit of an old question and you've probably found a solution by now, but for anyone else coming across this question, check out the MagicMove library by Ryan Florence. It's a React library to handle the exact scenario you describe: https://github.com/ryanflorence/react-magic-move See it in action: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z5e7kWSHWTg#t=424Edit: This is broken in React 0.14.  See React Shuffle as an alternative, as suggested by Tim Arney below.The best way I can think of to accomplish this off the top of my head would be to first make sure that you give every one of your elements a key as described here:http://facebook.github.io/react/docs/multiple-components.html#dynamic-childrenNext I would define CSS3 animation similar to this:Animating lists with CSS3Basically in your render function you would calculate where the element is suppose to go, ReactJS will place the element where it's suppose to be (make sure you give each element the same key every time! This is important to make sure ReactJS reuses your DOM element properly).  In theory at least, the CSS should take care of the rest of the animation for you outside of reactjs/javascript.Disclamer... I've never actually tried this ;)I didn't want to use a third-part library for my animations so I implemented the \"FLIP\" animation technique using React lifecycle methods getSnapshotBeforeUpdate() and componentDidUpdate().When the list item's props.index changes the old position is captured in getSnapshotBeforeUpdate() and in componentDidUpdate() the css transform: translateY() is applied so that the item appears to be animating from old position to current position.Because the position of an element depends heavily on the DOM engine, I find it really hard to implement tweening and animating in a pure way within React components. If you want to do it cleanly, I think you need at least: a Store to hold the current position of an element, a Store to hold the next position of an element (or combine it with the previous store), and a render() method that applies the offset margins per element until in the final frame, the next positions become current. How you calculate the next positions in the first place is also a challenge. But given that the elements only swap positions, you could use the Store with the current positions to swap element #0 with element #1, by swapping their offsets in the next positions Store.In the end it's easier to just use an external library to manipulate the elements' margins after they're rendered.Just use ReactCSSTransitionGroup.\nIt's built into the React with Addons package and is perfect for this use case! Just make sure that the component on which you apply the transition has already mounted to the DOM. Use the CSS that is in the linked example for a nice fading transition."},

Looking at the existing answers, I feel they offer solutions without explanation so here is my attempt to help with that. For context, by default, the container will not try to break a single long word up because it wants to preserve the word in it's original form.With that said, 3 main ways to break up words there is overflow-wrap, word-break, and hypens. I won't dive too deep into hypens though.So first off. I see word-wrap is being used in the question but reading the documentation, that is deprecated and some browsers have decided to simply alias it to overflow-wrap. It's probably preferred not to use that.The distinction between the two properties is pretty clear in the documentation but for clarity, overflow-wrap really only has two possible values and will detect if a word has been overflowed. If it does, by default it moves the entire word to the next line. If break-word is set, it will only break up the word if the entire word couldn't be placed on that line.You can see the pneumonoul... long word breaks exactly where it needs to on the next line after it attempts to separate the long word.Now in contrast, we have word-break. This has more granular properties and actually also has a break-word option. This is synonymous to the above snippet so when to use one or the other I think is pretty trivial. However, word-break also offers a break-all value which will break the word whenever possible to fit word where it was originally intended. It doesn't try to figure out if it needs the word to be on a new line or not -- it simply shoves the line break where it overflows. The biggest distinction here from the above is that long word we use is now still on the top.And then finally for hyphens have their own special way of breaking up words. For more info take a look at the documentation. Also worth noting that different languages have different ways of breaking up words but fortunately the hyphens property hooks into the lang attribute and understands what to do.Another option people have suggested is using the white-space property which attempts to break up text through spaces. In the example I used, this doesn't help our situation because the word itself is longer than the container. I think the important thing to note about this CSS property is that this doesn't attempt to break up words within themselves and rather tries to do it via spaces whenever appropriate. Hope this helps.It does not wrap properly, because browsers do not apply automatic hyphenation (which would be the way to cause proper wrapping) by default. You need to use CSS hyphenation or JavaScipt-based hyphenation. The setting word-wrap:break-word, as well as word-break: break-all, by definition breaks words (splits th em to piece s at arbit rary poin ts), instead of proper wrapping.Because the css word-wrap doesn't work in all browsers, use JavaScript instead! It should give the same result.The function below requires JQuery and it will run each time window re-size.The function checks if the element has more width then its parent, and if it has, it breaks all instead of words only. We don't want the children to grow bigger than it's parents, right?I only needed it for tables, so if you want it in some other element, just change \"table\" to \"#yourId\" or \".yourClass\". Make sure there is a parent-div or change \"div\" to \"body\" or something?If it will go to else, it changes to word-break and then check if it should change back, that's why there is so much code.. :'/I hope it works for you!This is useful for wrapping text in one line:"},

Just try turning off JS now. What about javascript code that continuously postpones a http-equiv=refresh (each time replacing the meta element?)  As soon as javascript is turned off, the meta element is no longer replaced and the refresh will eventually take place. This is just a thought, I've no idea if meta element insertion is even possible.I'd recommend looking into how this is done by HTML5 Boilerplate and Modernizr.If you look at HTML5 Boilerplate's HTML, on line 7 you'll see the <html> tag is given a class of no-js. Then, when Modernizr's JavaScript runs, the first thing it does is remove the no-js class.That done, you could apply CSS rules that only display content if the no-js class is present:Expanding upon @JoshMock's answer, here is a simple approach (via Paul Irish) to detect if the client has JS enabled:HTMLThis should be compatible with all browsers and is quite fast. Then you can hide/show elements in your css with .js and .no-js classes. If you are doing any other feature detection, I would suggest using Modernizr with the html class=\"no-js\" markup (modernizr will automatically add the js classes for you, along with css3 detection).Actually, it is easier to detect if java-script is supported by the browser than the opposite.Of course, this is in the case of 'a site instantly detect javascript'. Witch is the very first http-request <--> response from the browser to the server. You just 'cannot'. You would have to send another request to the server after determining browser capabilities.Now, there is no way of checking if JavaScript is enabled from the server-side on the first request. So, if JavaScript is disabled, you have to do a postback, or redirect to a non JavaScript page, using what some other suggested (witch is not valid, but seems to work):There are some 'browser capabilities' and browser 'plugins' that can be get with http request, so you would need a good 'server-side' script to meet your goal.See browserhawk or quirksmode for some infos on a javascript to detect browser.Also, there is a 'protected' question aboout how-to-detect-if-javascript-is-disabled"},

One option would be to use an IE specific conditional comment to load Respond. Another option is to use yepnope and Modernizr to test for media query support and load Respond if needed. Which would be more efficient and fault-proof.Lastly, if I choose to separate the two scripts and use Modernizr to load Respond if needed I have encountered the two following techniques:ORI have found that the second crashes IE8, but must just need rewriting. Which technique would you recommend?Thanks for all the help.Well you need at least some CSS3 media queries to get you started. Respond.js is essentially just a JavaScript implementation of media queries for browsers that don't support them (e.g. IE less than 8). Just make sure the reference to Respond.js comes AFTER your CSS3 media queries (link).So, yes, assuming you have Respond.js bundled with Modernizr from a custom build or whatever, and that is loaded after your CSS3, you're all good. Also, Modernizr needs some more configuration in the  of your HTML (link)Modernizr doesn't come with support for browsers without media queries out of the box. You need to add it in a custom build. So, yes, I think it's smart to always include respond. Minified, the library only adds a little more than 3kb, and having it included in the Modernizr file won't add another GET request. I'd say just leave it in there to be prepared for everything.Third, I'd go with the Modernizr method. I like using new stuff, all that extra JavaScript gets in the way.The new version of Respond includes some feature testing so you don't need Modernizr or Yepnope!Here's the revision:\nhttps://github.com/scottjehl/Respond/commit/4d60f45716b8395e6f24238f9dc5e34c857e87f2Also, you should note that using yepnope.js could cause a delay in which you see the non-media query styles before the media query styles are parsed and applied.  The recommendation is that you put respond.js in the header to avoid this as much as possible, although, it's also good to keep your js files in the footer so up to you.Feature testing might be in newer lib like tkane2000 says ... \nJust wanted to mention you could probably do this via Modernizr too:Original Poster has i think invalid media query check '(only all)' ... Shouldnt be any parenthesis based on some things I read. Once I removed the parens, respond.js seems to be included appropriately."},

This will just cause a read error and will never trigger any update on your grid's datasource, (ie. dataBound event will never happen). On the other hand, an empty datasource is still a valid datasource and will trigger the dataBound event.Anyways, here is my solution. Firstly, to emulate an empty datasource, I have set the datasource like so:Now, the proper way to check whether your grid is truly empty is to read the datasource itself. The others do it... in a more hacky way by reading html DOM. Please do NOT do this as you may have multiple pages, filters, etc... where the item is in the dataSource but not the DOM. Here is how you should do it:Now, when you read your datasource, the dataBound event is triggered every time. Thus, you should put the above code in the dataBound event. Check if grid dataSource is empty, and then fire a message to the user. Here is my full code for dataBound.What is this crazy mess above? You'll notice that I am doing a lot of stuff with the variable mBox. This is simply an empty <div> I added on the html page with id msgBox, and I am using it to instantiate a kendoWindow to create the popup saying that there is no data. You can find out more about kendoWindow here. So instead of using ugly alert boxes, I am just taking advantage of another part of kendo UI's widget library, which is customizable and controllable.The if and else logic with the mBox simply handles subsequent calls to show the message. The first time, the kendoWindow has not been instantiated so it goes through the if clause. Subsequent calls with just reopen the window. Give it a try :). You can click the next page buttons to verify that it will show the popup again. Here is a jsFiddle Demo. I know I'm late to the party but here's how I just did it. It's mostly copied from the TreeList's no data feature (I was annoyed that you didn't have the same thing with the standard grid). I made it into a prototype extension so it's automatically added to every grid. An option could also be added to make the message configurable.Can't you do something like this -Or you are looking for something even cleaner something inbuilt in Kendo?\nI think, this is an issue still there in Kendo UI which hasn't been fixed yet\nSee this - http://www.telerik.com/forums/empty-grid-norecords-templateIf your grid has detail grids (nested grids) then the above examples wont work on the nested grids. To ensure you apply this to all of your kendo grids you can do the following:Then call this function after all of your content has been loaded, there is no need to add it to each grid individually.if you wanted to change the message then add emptyMsg to your dataSource i.e.Kendo grid No Data found message };On Grid Data Bound..Add the following script to show Message.Not sure what was the exact version this question was asked, but in my case none of the above solutions worked.I used the following one: "},

See the below example.You can do this with animation-keyframe rather than transition. Change your hover declaration and add the animation keyframe, you might also need to add browser prefixes for -moz- and -webkit-.

The line elements just have a bottom border on them, and the circle elements are just relatively positioned downwards to align with the line.Note that the circles need to have an extra container, otherwise table-cell will stretch all the circles to the same height, and you don't want that that.

So many changing the color of the arrows (NOT the background like I've done). CSSCarousel HTMLI hope this works, cheers.\nI know this is an older post, but it helped me out. I've also found that for bootstrap v4 you can also change the arrow color by overriding the controls like this:Where you change fill='%23fff' the fff at the end to any hexadecimal value that you want. For example:fill='%23000' for black, fill='%23ff0000' for red and so on. Just a note, I haven't tested this without the !important declaration.If you just want to make them black in Bootstrap 4.You should use also: <span><i class=\"fa fa-angle-left\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></i></span> using fontawesome. You have to overwrite the original code. Do the following and you'll be free to customize on CSS:The original codeCurrently Bootstrap 4 uses a background-image with embbed SVG data info that include the color of the SVG shape. Something like:Note the part about fill='%23fff' it fills the shape with a color, in this case #fff (white), for red simply replace with #f00Finally, it is safe to include this (same change for next-icon):In bootstrap 4 if you are just changing the colour of the controls you can use the sass variables, typically in custom.scss: $carousel-control-color: #7b277d;As highlighted in this github issue note: https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/issues/21985#issuecomment-281402443a little example that works for mefor bootstrap-3 one can use:If you are using bootstrap.min.css for carousel-Open the bootstrap.min.css file and find the property \"glyphicon-chevron-right\" and add the property \"color:red\"To customize the colors for the carousel controls, captions, and indicators using Sass you can include these variables I too had a similar problem, some images were very light and some dark, so the arrows didn't always show up clearly so I took a more simplistic approach.In the modal-body section I just removed the following lines:and inserted the following into the modal-header sectionThe indicators can now be clearly seen, no adding extra icons or messing with style sheets, although you could style them however you wanted!See this demo image:[With Font Awesome icons:"}
