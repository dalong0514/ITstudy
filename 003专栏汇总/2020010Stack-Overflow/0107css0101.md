I have seen that chrome puts a thicker border on :focus but it kind of looks off in my case where I've used border-radius also. Is there anyway to remove that? You should be able to remove it using but keep in mind this is potentially bad for usability: It will be hard to tell whether an element is focused, which can suck when you walk through all a form's elements using the Tab key - you should reflect somehow when an element is focused.I had to do all of the follow to completely remove itTo remove the default focus, use the following in your default .css file :You can then control the focus border color either individually by element, or in the default .css:Obviously replace red with your chosen hex code.You could also leave the border untouched and control the background color (or image) to highlight the field::-)This will definitely work. Orange outline won't show up anymore..

Common for all tags:Specific to some tag, ex: input tagThis should do the trick.The simpliest way is to use something like this but note that it may not be that good.I hope you find this useful.you could just set outline: none; and border to a different color on focus.Problem is when you already have an outline. Chrome still changes something and it's a real pain. I cannot find what to change :

Is it possible to set drop shadow for an svg element using css3 , something likeI saw some remarks on creating shadow using filter effects. Is there an example of using css alone. Below is a working code where the cusor style is correctly applied, but no shadow effect. Please help me to get the shadow effect with least bit of code.Here's an example of applying dropshadow to some svg using the 'filter' property. If you want to control the opacity of the dropshadow have a look at this example. The slope attribute controls how much opacity to give to the dropshadow.Relevant bits from the example:Box-shadow is defined to work on CSS boxes (read: rectangles), while svg is a bit more expressive than just rectangles. Read the SVG Primer to learn a bit more about what you can do with SVG filters.Use the new CSS filter property.Supported by webkit browsers, Firefox 34+ and Edge.You can use this polyfill that will support FF < 34, IE6+.You would use it like so:This approach differs from the box-shadow effect in that it accounts for opacity and does not apply the drop shadow effect to the box but rather to the corners of the svg element itself.Please Note: This approach only works when the class is placed on the <svg> element alone. You can NOT use this on an inline svg element such as <rect>.Read more about css filters on html5rocks.You can easily add a drop-shadow effect to an svg-element using the drop-shadow() CSS function and rgba color values. By using rgba color values you can change the opacity of your shadow.Easiest way I've found is with feDropShadow. I will never go back to using those incredibly esoteric filter tag names that I don't understand.I'm not aware of a CSS-only solution. As you mentioned, filters are the canonical approach to creating drop shadow effects in SVG. The SVG specification includes an example of this.Probably an evolution, it appears that inline css filters works nicely on elements, in a certain way. Declaring a drop-shadow css filter, in an svg element, in both a class or inline does NOT works, as specified earlier.But, at least in Firefox, with the following wizardry: Appending the filter declaration inline, with javascript, after DOM load.Another way, I used for white shadow (on text): create a clone for shadow:Note: This require xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" at SVG declaration.Real text value is located in <defs> section, with position and style, but without a fill definition.The text is cloned two times: first for shadow and second for the text itself.With same requirement: No fill definition at <defs> section!

CSS background image to fit width, height should auto-scale in proportion

[CSS background image to fit width, height should auto-scale in proportion](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9262861/css-background-image-to-fit-width-height-should-auto-scale-in-proportion)

I haveThe desired effect is that this background image will have width equal to that of the page, height changing to maintain the proportion. e.g. if the original image happens to be 100*200 (any units) and the body is 600px wide, the background image should end up being 1200px high. The height should change automatically if the window is resized. Is this possible?At the moment, Firefox looks like it's making the height fit and then adjusting the width. Is this perhaps because the height is the longest dimension and it's trying to avoid cropping? I want to crop vertically, then scroll: no horizontal repeat.Also, Chrome is placing the image in the centre, no repeat, even when background-repeat:repeat is given explicitly, which is the default anyway.

I want to crop vertically, then scroll: no horizontal repeat.Also, Chrome is placing the image in the centre, no repeat, even when background-repeat:repeat is given explicitly, which is the default anyway. There is a CSS3 property for this, namely background-size (compatibility check). While one can set length values, it's usually used with the special values contain and cover. In your specific case, you should use cover:Sorry for the bad pun, but I'm going to use the picture of the day by Biswarup Ganguly for demonstration. Lets say that this is your screen, and the gray area is outside of your visible screen. For demonstration, I'm going to assume a 16x9 ratio.We want to use the aforementioned picture of the day as a background. However, we cropped the image to 4x3 for some reason. We could set the background-size property to some fixed length, but we will focus on contain and cover. Note that I also assume that we didn't mangle the width and/or height of body.This makes sure that the background image is always completely contained in the background positioning area, however, there could be some empty space filled with your background-color in this case:This makes sure that the background image is covering everything. There will be no visible  background-color, however depending on the screen's ratio a great part of your image could be cut off:Based on tips from https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/CSS/background-size I end up with the following recipe that worked for meI'm not sure what you're looking for exactly, but you really should check out these excellent blog posts written by Chris Coyier from CSS-Tricks:http://css-tricks.com/how-to-resizeable-background-image/http://css-tricks.com/perfect-full-page-background-image/Read the descriptions for each of the articles and see if they're what you're looking for.The first answers the following question:The second post's goal is to get the following, a "background image on a website that covers the entire browser window at all times.

By default flex-basis is auto.  From the spec:Each flex item has a flex-basis which is sort of like its initial size.  Then from there, any remaining free space is distributed proportionally (based on flex-grow) among the items.  With auto, that basis is the contents size (or defined size with width, etc.).  As a result, items with bigger text within are being given more space overall in your example.If you want your elements to be completely even, you can set flex-basis: 0.  This will set the flex basis to 0 and then any remaining space (which will be all space since all basises are 0) will be proportionally distributed based on flex-grow.This diagram from the spec does a pretty good job of illustrating the point.And here is a working example with your fiddle.To create elements with equal width using Flex, you should set to your's child (flex elements):It will give to all elements in row 25% width. They will not grow and go one by one.

I want my body to stop scrolling when using the mousewheel while the Modal (from http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap) on my website is opened.I've tried to call the piece of javascript below when the modal is opened but without successANDPlease note our website dropped support for IE6, IE7+ needs to be compatible though.Bootstrap's modal automatically adds the class modal-open to the body when a modal dialog is shown and removes it when the dialog is hidden. You can therefore add the following to your CSS:You could argue that the code above belongs to the Bootstrap CSS code base, but this is an easy fix to add it to your site.Update 8th feb, 2013

This has now stopped working in Twitter Bootstrap v. 2.3.0 -- they no longer add the modal-open class to the body.A workaround would be to add the class to the body when the modal is about to be shown, and remove it when the modal is closed:Update 11th march, 2013

Looks like the modal-open class will return in Bootstrap 3.0, explicitly for the purpose of preventing the scroll: See this: https://github.com/twitter/bootstrap/pull/6342 - look at the Modal section.The accepted answer doesn't work on mobile (iOS 7 w/ Safari 7, at least) and I don't want MOAR JavaScript running on my site when CSS will do.This CSS will prevent the background page from scrolling under the modal:However, it also has a slight side-affect of essentially scrolling to the top. position:absolute resolves this but, re-introduces the ability to scroll on mobile.If you know your viewport (my plugin for adding viewport to the <body>) you can just add a css toggle for the position.I also add this to prevent the underlying page from jumping left/right when showing/hiding modals.this answer is a x-post.Simply hide the body overflow and it makes body not scrolling. When you hide the modal, revert it to automatic. Here is the code:You could try setting body size to window size with overflow: hidden when modal is openWarning: The option below is not relevant to Bootstrap v3.0.x, as scrolling in those versions has been explicitly confined to the modal itself.  If you disable wheel events you may inadvertently prevent some users from viewing the content in modals that have heights greater than the viewport height.The scroll event is not cancelable.  However it is possible to cancel the mousewheel and wheel events.  The big caveat is that not all legacy browsers support them, Mozilla only recently adding support for the latter in Gecko 17.0.  I don't know the full spread, but IE6+ and Chrome do support them.Here's how to leverage them:You need to go beyond @charlietfl's answer and account for scrollbars, otherwise you may see a document reflow.Inspired by: http://jdsharp.us/jQuery/minute/calculate-scrollbar-width.phpCouldn't make it work on Chrome just by changing CSS, because I didn't want the page to scroll back to the top. This worked fine:Try this one:it worked for me. (supports IE8)Adding the class 'is-modal-open' or modifying style of body tag with javascript is okay and it will work as supposed to. But the problem we gonna face is when the body becomes overflow:hidden, it will jump to the top, ( scrollTop will become 0 ). This will become a usability issue later. As a solution for this problem, instead of changing body tag overflow:hidden change it on html tagHope this helps...I'm not sure about this code, but it's worth a shot.In jQuery:As I said before, I'm not 100% sure but try anyway.As of November 2017 Chrome Introduced a new css propertyoverscroll-behavior: contain;which solves this problem although as of writing has limited cross browser support.see below links for full details and browser support Many suggest "overflow: hidden" on the body, which will not work (not in my case at least), since it will make the website scroll to the top.This is the solution that works for me (both on mobile phones and computers), using jQuery:This will make the scrolling of the modal to work, and prevent the website from scrolling at the same time.You could use the following logic, I tested it and it works(even in IE) The best solution is the css-only body{overflow:hidden} solution used by most of these answers.  Some answers provide a fix that also prevent the "jump" caused by the disappearing scrollbar; however, none were too elegant.  So, I wrote these two functions, and they seem to work pretty well.Check out this jsFiddle to see it in use.I'm not 100% sure this will work with Bootstrap but worth a try - it worked with Remodal.js which can be found on github: http://vodkabears.github.io/remodal/ and it would make sense for the methods to be pretty similar.To stop the page jumping to the top and also prevent the right shift of content add a class to the body when the modal is fired and set these CSS rules:It's the position:static and the height:auto that combine to stop the jumping of content to the right. The overflow-y:hidden; stops the page from being scrollable behind the modal.Based on this fiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/dh834zgw/1/the following snippet (using jquery) will disable the window scroll:And in your css:Now when you remove the modal, don't forget to remove the noscroll class on the html tag:I had a sidebar that was generated by checkbox hack.

But the main idea is to save the document scrollTop and not to change it during scrolling the window.I just didn't like the page jumping when body becomes 'overflow: hidden'.Sadly none of the answers above fixed my issues.In my situation, the web page originally has a scroll bar. Whenever I click the modal, the scroll bar won't disappear and the header will move to right a bit.Then I tried to add .modal-open{overflow:auto;} (which most people recommended). It indeed fixed the issues: the scroll bar appears after I open the modal. However, another side effect comes out which is that "background below the header will move to the left a bit, together with another long bar behind the modal"Luckily, after I add {padding-right: 0 !important;}, everything is fixed perfectly. Both the header and body background didn't move and the modal still keeps the scrollbar.Hope this can help those who are still stuck with this issue. Good luck!Most of the pieces are here, but I don't see any answer that puts it all together.The problem is threefold.(1) prevent the scroll of the underlying page(2) and remove the scroll bar(3) clean up when the modal is dismissedIf the modal is not full-screen then apply the .modal bindings to a full screen overlay.My solution for Bootstrap 3:because for me the only overflow: hidden on the body.modal-open class did not prevent the page from shifting to the left due to the original margin-right: 15px.I just done it this way ...But when the scroller dissapeared it moved everything right 20px, so i added straight after it.Works for me.If modal are 100% height/width "mouseenter/leave" will work to easily enable/disable scrolling. This really worked out for me:worked for meWhy not to do that as Bulma does?

When modal is-active then add to html their class .is-clipped which is overflow: hidden!important;

And thats it.Edit: Okey, Bulma has this bug, so you must add also other things likeSince for me this problem presented mainly on iOS, I provide the code to fix that only on iOS:None of the above answers worked perfectly for me. So I found another way which works well.  Just add a scroll.(namespace) listener and set scrollTop of the document to the latest of it's value...and also remove the listener in your close script.seems, this does not work well on chrome. any suggestion to fix it ?This worked for me:For those wondering how to get the scroll event for the bootstrap 3 modal:

And you can use disabled attribute, if you want input to be shown, but totally disabled (even processing languages like PHP wont be able to read those).Just to complete the answers available:An input element can be either readonly or disabled (none of them is editable, but there are a couple of differences: focus,...)Good explanation can be found here:

Also it's a bit ugly with the <br> in front for IE.Does anyone know of a way to create a <style> tag thatOr maybeTry adding the style element to the head rather than the body.This was tested in IE (7-9), Firefox, Opera and Chrome:Here's a script which adds IE-style createStyleSheet() and addRule() methods to browsers which don't have them:You can add external files viaand dynamically create rules viaI'm assuming that you're wanting to insert a style tag versus a link tag (referencing an external CSS), so that's what the following example does:Also, I noticed in your question that you are using innerHTML. This is actually a non-standard way of inserting data into a page. The best practice is to create a text node and append it to another element node.With respect to your final question, you're going to hear some people say that your work should work across all of the browsers. It all depends on your audience. If no one in your audience is using Chrome, then don't sweat it; however, if you're looking to reach the biggest audience possible, then it's best to support all major A-grade browsers<style> tags should be places within the <head> element, and each added tag should be added to the bottom of the <head> tag.Using insertAdjacentHTML to inject a style tag into the document head tag:An example that works and are compliant with all browsers :Oftentimes there's a need to override existing rules, so appending new styles to the HEAD doesn't work in every case.I came up with this simple function that summarizes all not valid "append to the BODY" approaches and is just more convenient to use and debug (IE8+).Demo: codepen, jsfiddleThis object variable will append style tag to the head tag with type attribute and one simple transition rule inside that matches every single id/class/element. Feel free to modify content property and inject as many rules as you need. Just make sure that css rules inside content remain in one line (or 'escape' each new line, if You prefer so). Here is a variant for dynamically adding a class All good, but for styleNode.cssText to work in IE6 with node created by javascipt, you need to append the node to the document before you set the cssText;further info @ http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms533698%28VS.85%29.aspxThis function will inject css whenever you call the function appendStyle like this:

appendStyle('css you want to inject')This works by injecting a style node into the head of the document. This is a similar technique to what is commonly used to lazy-load JavaScript.

It works consistently in most modern browsers.You can also lazy-load external CSS files by using the following snippet:You wrote:Why not this?Henceforward you can append CSS rules easily to the HTML code:...or directly to the DOM:I expect this to work everywhere except archaic browsers.Definitely works in Chrome in year 2019.If the problem you're facing is injecting a string of CSS into a page it is easier to do this with the <link> element than the <style> element.The following adds p { color: green; } rule to the page.You can create this in JavaScript simply by URL encoding your string of CSS and adding it the HREF attribute. Much simpler than all the quirks of <style> elements or directly accessing stylesheets.This will work in IE 5.5 upwardsBy far the most straightforward solution. All you have to do is type the same as how you'd normally declare style tags, between the backtickshttp://jonraasch.com/blog/javascript-style-node

I am wondering if its possible to remove the default blue and yellow glow when I click on a text input / text area using CSS?Although, it's been argued that keeping the glow/outline is actually beneficial for accessibility as it can help users see which Element is currently focused.You can also use the pseudo-element ':focus' to only target the inputs when the user has them selected.Demo: https://jsfiddle.net/JohnnyWalkerDesign/xm3zu0cf/This effect can occur on non-input elements, too. I've found the following works as a more general solutionUpdate: You may not have to use the :focus selector. If you have an element, say <div id="mydiv">stuff</div>, and you were getting the outer glow on this div element, just apply like normal:On textarea resizing in webkit based browsers: Setting max-height and max-width on the textarea will not remove the visual resize handle.

You are killing accessibility of the web if you do this. There is a accessible way of doing this.Check out this article that I've written to explain how to remove the border in an accessible way.The idea in short is to only show the outline border when we detect a keyboard user. Once a user starts using his mouse we disable the outline. As a result you get the best of the two.If you want to remove the glow from buttons in Bootstrap (which is not necessarily bad UX in my opinion), you'll need the following code:some times it's happens buttons also then use below to remove the outerlineThis solution worked for me.I found it helpful to remove the outline on a "sliding door" type of input button, because the outline doesn't cover the right "cap" of the sliding door image making the focus state look a little wonky.

I have a fluid width container DIV.Within this I have 4 DIVs all 300px x 250px...What I want to happen is box 1 to be floated left, box 4 to be floated right and box 2 and 3 to be spaced evenly between them.  I want the spacing to be fluid as well so as the browser is made smaller the space becomes smaller also.See: http://jsfiddle.net/thirtydot/EDp8R/The extra span (.stretch) can be replaced with :after.This still works in all the same browsers as the above solution. :after doesn't work in IE6/7, but they're using distribute-all-lines anyway, so it doesn't matter.See: http://jsfiddle.net/thirtydot/EDp8R/3/There's a minor downside to :after: to make the last row work perfectly in Safari, you have to be careful with the whitespace in the HTML.Specifically, this doesn't work:And this does:You can use this for any arbitrary number of child divs without adding a boxN class to each one by changingtoThis selects any div that is the first child of the #container div, and no others below it. To generalize the background colors, you can use the CSS3 nth-order selector, although it's only supported in IE9+ and other modern browsers:becomes:See here for a jsfiddle example.The easiest way to do this now is with a flexbox:http://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/The CSS is then simply:demo: http://jsfiddle.net/QPrk3/However, this is currently only supported by relatively recent browsers (http://caniuse.com/flexbox).

Also, the spec for flexbox layout has changed a few times, so it's possible to cover more browsers by additionally including an older syntax:http://css-tricks.com/old-flexbox-and-new-flexbox/http://css-tricks.com/using-flexbox/If css3 is an option, this can be done using the css calc() function.Markup is simple - a bunch of divs with some container element.CSS looks like this:where -1px to fix an IE9+ calc/rounding bug - see hereHere, in addition to the calc() function, media queries are necessary.The basic idea is to set up a media query for each #columns states, where I then use calc() to work out the margin-right on each of the elements (except the ones in the last column).This sounds like a lot of work, but if you're using LESS or SASS this can be done quite easily (It can still be done with regular css, but then you'll have to do all the calculations manually, and then if you change your box width - you have to work out everything again)Below is an example using LESS: (You can copy/paste this code here to play with it, [it's also the code I used to generate the above mentioned fiddle])So basically you first need to decide a box-width and a minimum margin that you want between the boxes.With that, you can work out how much space you need for each state.Then, use calc() to calcuate the right margin, and nth-child to remove the right margin from the boxes in the final column.The advantage of this answer over the accepted answer which uses text-align:justify is that when you have more than one row of boxes - the boxes on the final row don't get 'justified' eg: If there are 2 boxes remaining on the final row - I don't want the first box to be on the left and the next one to be on the right - but rather that the boxes follow each other in order.Regarding browser support: This will work on IE9+,Firefox,Chrome,Safari6.0+ - (see here for more details) However i noticed that on IE9+ there's a bit of a glitch between media query states. [if someone knows how to fix this i'd really like to know :) ]    <-- FIXED HEREOther posts have mentioned flexbox, but if more than one row of items is necessary, flexbox's space-between property fails (see the end of the post)To date, the only clean solution for this is with theBasically the relevant code necessary boils down to this:1) Make the container element a grid container2) Set the grid with an 'auto' amount of columns - as necessary. This is done for responsive layouts. The width of each column will be 120px. (Note the use of auto-fit (as apposed to auto-fill) which (for a 1-row layout) collapses empty tracks to 0 - allowing the items to expand to take up the remaining space. (check out this demo to see what I'm talking about) ).3) Set gaps/gutters for the grid rows and columns - here, since want a 'space-between' layout - the gap will actually be a minimum gap because it will grow as necessary.4) and 5) - Similar to flexbox.Currently supported by Chrome (Blink), Firefox, Safari and Edge! ... with partial support from IE (See this post by Rachel Andrew)

Flexbox's space-between property works great for one row of items, but when applied to a flex container which wraps it's items - (with flex-wrap: wrap) - fails, because you have no control over the alignment of the last row of items;

the last row will always be justified (usually not what you want)To demonstrate:Codepen (Resize to see what i'm talking about)Further reading on CSS grids:This worked for me with 5 images in diferent sizes.This works because of justify-content:space-between, and it's on a list, displayed horizontally. On CSS       On htmlin jQuery you might target the Parent directly.This will let the parent grow horizontally as the children are beng added.NOTE: This assumes that the '.children' have a width and Height SetHope that Helps.If you know the number of elements per "row" and the width of the container you can use a selector to add a margin to the elements you need to cause a justified look.I had rows of three divs I wanted justified so used the: .tile:nth-child(3n+2) { margin: 0 10px }this allows the center div in each row to have a margin that forces the 1st and 3rd div to the outside edges of the containerAlso great for other things like borders background colors etc

I could perform this sort of thing using javascript (JQuery springs to mind), but I was wondering if there is a way to do this using CSS selectors.Just to be clear, I want to apply a style to the list item, not the anchor.Unfortunately, there's no way to do that with CSS.It's not very difficult with JavaScript though:According to Wikipedia:And for anyone searching SO in future, this might also be referred to as an ancestor selector.Update: The Selectors Level 4 Spec allows you to select which part of the select is the subject:Although this isn't available (currently, November 2011) in any browser or as a selector in jQuery.Late to the party again but for what it's worth it is possible using jQuery to be a little more succinct. In my case I needed to find the <ul> parent tag for a <span> tag contained in the child <li>. jQuery has the :has selector so it's possible to identify a parent by the children it contains (updated per @Afrowave's comment ref: https://api.jquery.com/has-selector/):will select the ul element that has a child element with id someId. Or to answer the original question, something like the following should do the trick (untested):Right now, there is no option to select the parent of an element in CSS (not even CSS3). But with CSS4, the most important news in the current W3C draft is the support for the parent selector.Using the above, when hovering an list element, the whole unordered list will be highlighted by adding a white background to it.Official documentation: https://www.w3.org/TR/2011/WD-selectors4-20110929/#overview (last row).The first draft of Selectors Level 4 outlines a way to explicitly set the subject of a selector. This would allow the OP to style the list element with the selector $li > a.activeFrom Determining the Subject of a Selector:Edit: Given how "drafty" a draft spec can be, it's best to keep tabs on this by checking the CSSWG's page on selectors level 4.New CSS Specs contain an experimental :has pseudo selector that might be able to do this thing.The browser support on this is basically non-existent at this time, but it is in consideration on the official specs.While it is true that CSS cannot ASCEND, it is incorrect that you cannot grab the parent element of another element. Let me reiterate:Using your HTML example code, you are able to grab the li without specifying liIn this example, the ul is the parent of some element and that element is the parent of anchor. The downside of using this method is that if there is a ul with any child element that contains an anchor, it inherits the styles specified.You may also use the child selector as well since you'll have to specify the parent element anyway.In this example, the anchor must be a descendant of an li that MUST be a child of ul, meaning it must be within the tree following the ul declaration. This is going to be a bit more specific and will only grab a list item that contains an anchor AND is a child of ul.SO, to answer your question by code.This should grab the ul with the class of menu, and the child list item that contains only an anchor with the class of active.I had the same problem with Drupal. Given the limitations of CSS, the way to get this working is to add the "active" class to the parent elements when the menu HTML is generated. There's a good discussion of this at http://drupal.org/node/219804, the upshot of which is that this functionality has been rolled in to version 6.x-2.x of the nicemenus module. As this is still in development, I've backported the patch to 6.x-1.3 at http://drupal.org/node/465738 so that I can continue to use the production-ready version of the module.Many people answered with jQuery parent, but just to add on to that I wanted to share a quick snippet of code that I use for adding classes to my navs so I can add styling to li's that only have sub-menus and not li's that don't.I actually ran into the same issue as the original poster.  There is a simple solution of just using .parent() jQuery selector.  My problem was, I was using .parent instead of .parent(). Stupid mistake I know.Bind the events (in this case since my tabs are in Modal I needed to bind them with .live instead of a basic .click.Here is the HTML..Of course you can repeat that pattern..with more LI'sAnother thought occurred to me just now that could be a pure CSS solution. Display your active class as an absolutely positioned block and set its style to cover up the parent li.For those of you who want to use javascript without jquery...Selecting the parent is trivial. You need a getElementsByClass function of some sort, unless you can get your drupal plugin to assign the active item an ID instead of Class. The function I provided I grabbed from some other genius on SO. It works well, just keep in mind when you're debugging that the function will always return an array of nodes, not just a single node.

How do I get them both to simultaneously animate? Thanks for any answers.Transition properties are comma delimited in all browsers that support transitions:ease is the default timing function, so you don't have to specify it. If you really want linear, you will need to specify it:This starts to get repetitive, so if you're going to be using the same times and timing functions across multiple properties it's best to go ahead and use the various transition-* properties instead of the shorthand:You can also simply significantly with:Something like the following will allow for multiple transitions simultaneously:Example: http://jsbin.com/omogaf/2If you make all the properties animated the same, you can set each separately which will allow you to not repeat the code.There is more about it here: CSS transition shorthand with multiple properties?I would avoid using the property all (transition-property overwrites 'all'), since you could end up with unwanted behavior and unexpected performance hits.Here's a LESS mixin for transitioning two properties at once:It's possible to make the multiple transitions set with different values for duration, delay and timing function.

I have an image element that I want to change on click.This works:But what I need is:But, it doesn't work, obviously. Is it possible at all to have onclick behavior in CSS (i.e. without using JavaScript)?The closest you'll get is :active:However this will only apply the style when the mouse button is held down. The only way to apply a style and keep it applied onclick is to use a bit of JavaScript.The best way (actually the only way*) to simulate an actual click event using only CSS (rather than just hovering on an element or making an element active, where you don't have mouseUp) is to use the checkbox hack. It works by attaching a label to an <input type="checkbox"> element via the label's for="" attribute. This feature has broad browser support (the :checked pseudo-class is IE9+).Apply the same value to an <input>'s ID attribute and an accompanying <label>'s for="" attribute, and you can tell the browser to re-style the label on click with the :checked pseudo-class, thanks to the fact that clicking a label will check and uncheck the "associated" <input type="checkbox">.* You can simulate a "selected" event via the :active or :focus pseudo-class in IE7+ (e.g. for a button that's normally 50px wide, you can change its width while active: #btnControl:active { width: 75px; }), but those are not true "click" events. They are "live" the entire time the element is selected (such as by Tabbing with your keyboard), which is a little different from a true click event, which fires an action on - typically - mouseUp.Here I've positioned the label right after the input in my markup. This is so that I can use the adjacent sibling selector (the + key) to select only the label that immediately follows my #demo checkbox. Since the :checked pseudo-class applies to the checkbox, #demo:checked + label will only apply when the checkbox is checked. With that being said, there is some bad news. Because a label can only be associated with one form control at a time, that means you can't just drop a button inside the <label></label> tags and call it a day. However, we can use some CSS to make the label look and behave fairly close to how an HTML button looks and behaves.Most of the CSS in this demo is just for styling the label element. If you don't actually need a button, and any old element will suffice, then you can remove almost all of the styles in this demo, similar to my second demo above.You'll also notice I have one prefixed property in there, -moz-outline-radius. A while back, Mozilla added this awesome non-spec property to Firefox, but the folks at WebKit decided they aren't going to add it, unfortunately. So consider that line of CSS just a progressive enhancement for people who use Firefox.You can use pseudo class :target to mimic on click event, let me give you an example.Here's how it looks like: http://jsfiddle.net/TYhnb/One thing to note, this is only limited to hyperlink, so if you need to use on other than hyperlink, such as a button, you might want to hack it a little bit, such as styling a hyperlink to look like a button.If you give the element a tabindex then you can use the :focus pseudo class to simulate a click.HTMLCSShttp://jsfiddle.net/NaTj5/Edit: Answered before OP clarified what he wanted. The following is for an onclick similar to javascripts onclick, not the :active pseudo class.This can only be achieved with either Javascript or the Checkbox HackThe checkbox hack essentially gets you to click on a label, that "checks" a checkbox, allowing you to style the label as you wish.The demoTylerH made a really good answer, and I just had to give that last button version an update.How about a pure CSS solution without being (that) hacky?

@TylerH has a great response but its a pretty complex solution.  I have a solution for those of you that just want a simple "onclick" effect with pure css without a bunch of extra elements.We will simply use css transitions.  You could probably do similar with animations. The trick is to change the delay for the transition so that it will last when the user clicks.  Here I add the "clicked" class as well so that javascript can also provide the effect if it needs to.  I use 0px drop-shadow filter because it will highlight the given transparent graphic blue this way for my case.I have a filter at 0s here so that it wont take effect.  When the effect is released I can then add the transition with a delay so that it will provide a nice "clicked" effect. This allows me to set it up so that when the user clicks the button, it highlights blue then fades out slowly (you could, of course, use other effects as well). While you are limited here in the sense that the animation to highlight is instant, it does still provide the desired effect.  You could likely use this trick with animation to produce a smoother overall transition.Okay, this maybe an old post... but was first result in google and decided to make your own mix on this as..FIRSTLY I WILL USE FOCUSThe reason for this is that it works nicely for the example i'm showing, if someone wants a mouse down type event then use activeTHE HTML CODE:THE CSS CODE:JS FIDDLE LINK: http://jsfiddle.net/00wwkjux/So why am i posting this in an old thread, well because the examples here vary and i thought to provide one back to the community which is a working example.As already answered by the thread creator, they only want the effect to last during the click event. Now while this is not exact for that need, its close. active will animate while the mouse is down and any changes that you need to have last longer need to be done with javascript.Warning!  Particularly simple answer below!  :)You actually can have a change that persists (such as a block/popup that appears and stays visible after a click) with only CSS (and without using the checkbox hack) despite what many of the (otherwise correct) answers here claim, as long as you only need persistence during the hover.So take a look at Bojangles and TylerH's answers if those work for you, but if you want a simple and CSS only answer that will keep a block visible after being clicked on (and even can have the block disappear with a followup click), then see this solution.I had a similar situation, I needed a popup div with onClick where I couldn't add any JS or change the markup/HTML (a truly CSS solution) and this is possible with some caveats.  You can't use the :target trick that can create a nice popup unless you can change the HTML (to add an 'id') so that was out.In my case the popup div was contained inside the other div, and I wanted the popup to appear on top of the other div, and this can be done using a combination of :active and :hover:Example (as well as one that allows clicking on the popup to make it disappear) at:http://davesource.com/Solutions/20150324.CSS-Only-Click-to-Popup-Div/I've also inserted a code snippet example below, but the positioning in the stackoverflow sandbox is weird so I had to put the 'click here' text after the innerDiv, which isn't normally needed.I have the below code for mouse hover and mouse click and it works:and this code hides the image when you click on it:I had a problem with an element which had to be colored RED on hover and be BLUE on click while being hovered. To achieve this with css you need for example: I struggled for some time until I discovered that the order of CSS selectors was the problem I was having. The problem was that I switched the places and the active selector was not working. Then I found out that :hover to go first and then :active.you can use :targetfor general targetor filter by class nameor filter by id name

I try to add margin values on a div inside another div. All works fine except the top value, it seems to be ignored. But why?What I expected:

What I get:

Code:W3Schools have no explanation to why margin behave this way.You're actually seeing the top margin of the #inner element collapse into the top edge of the #outer element, leaving only the #outer margin intact (albeit not shown in your images). The top edges of both boxes are flush against each other because their margins are equal.Here are the relevant points from the W3C spec:You can do any of the following to prevent the margin from collapsing:The reason the above options prevent the margin from collapsing is because:The left and right margins behave as you expect because:Try using display: inline-block; on the inner div.What @BoltClock mentioned are pretty solid.

And Here I just want to add several more solutions for this problem.

check this w3c_collapsing margin. The green parts are the potential thought how this problem can be solved.Solution 1that means I can add float:left to either #outer or #inner demo1.also notice that float would invalidate the auto in margin.Solution 2other than visible, let's put overflow: hidden into #outer. And this way seems pretty simple and decent. I like it.Solution 3or these two methods will break the normal flow of divSolution 4is the same as @enderskillSolution 5This has not much work to do with the question since it is the collapsing margin between siblings. it generally means if a top-box has margin-bottom: 30px and a sibling-box has margin-top: 10px. The total margin between them is 30px instead of 40px.Solution 6This is very interesting and I can just add one top border lineAnd Also <div> is block-level in default, so you don't have to declare it on purpose. Sorry for not being able to post more than 2 links and images due to my novice reputation. At least you know where the problem comes from next time you see something similar.Not sure why what you have doesn't work, but you can addoverflow: auto; to the outer div.If you add any padding to #outer, it works.Demo Not exactly sure why, but changing the inner CSS toseems to work;Doesn't answer the "why" (has to be something w/ collapsing margin), but seems like the easiest/most logical way to do what you're trying to do would be to just add padding-top to the outer div:http://jsfiddle.net/hpU5d/1/Minor note - it shouldn't be necessary to set a div to display:block; unless there's something else in your code telling it not to be block.try this:http://jsfiddle.net/7AXTf/Good luckI guess setting the position property of the #inner div to relative may also help achieve the effect. But anyways I tried the original code pasted in the Question on IE9 and latest Google Chrome and they already give the desirable effect without any modifications.Use padding-top:50pxfor outer div. Something like this:Note: padding will increase the size of your div. In this case if the size of your div is important, I mean if it must have a specific height. decrease the height by 50px.:Have you tried !important before all, it will force everything:Just for a quick fix, try wrapping your child elements into a div element like this -Margin of inner div won't collapse due to the padding of 1px in-between outer and inner div. So logically you will have 1px extra space along with existing margin of inner div.

I am trying to vertically align elements within an ID wrapper. I gave the property display:inline-flex; to this ID as the ID wrapper is the flex container.But there is no difference in presentation. I expected that everything in the wrapper ID would be displayed inline. Why isn't it?JSFiddle Exampledisplay: inline-flex does not make flex items display inline. It makes the flex container display inline. That is the only difference between display: inline-flex and display: flex. A similar comparison can be made between display: inline-block and display: block, and pretty much any other display type that has an inline counterpart.1There is absolutely no difference in the effect on flex items; flex layout is identical whether the flex container is block-level or inline-level. In particular, the flex items themselves always behave like block-level boxes (although they do have some properties of inline-blocks). You cannot display flex items inline; otherwise you don't actually have a flex layout.It is not clear what exactly you mean by "vertically align" or why exactly you want to display the contents inline, but I suspect that flexbox is not the right tool for whatever you are trying to accomplish. Chances are what you're looking for is just plain old inline layout (display: inline and/or display: inline-block), for which flexbox is not a replacement; flexbox is not the universal layout solution that everyone claims it is (I'm stating this because the misconception is probably why you're considering flexbox in the first place).1 The differences between block layout and inline layout are outside the scope of this question, but the one that stands out the most is auto width: block-level boxes stretch horizontally to fill their containing block, whereas inline-level boxes shrink to fit their contents. In fact, it is for this reason alone you will almost never use display: inline-flex unless you have a very good reason to display your flex container inline.flex and inline-flex both apply flex layout to children of the container. Container with display:flex behaves like a block-level element itself, while display:inline-flex makes the container behaves like an inline element.OK, I know at first might be a bit confusing, but display is talking about the parent element, so means when we say: display: flex;, it's about the element and when we say display:inline-flex;, is also making the element itself inline...It's like make a div inline or block, run the snippet below and you can see how display flex breaks down to next line:Also quickly create the image below to show the difference at a glance:The Difference between "flex" and "inline-flex"Short answer: One is inline and the other basically responds like a block element(but has some of it's own differences).Longer answer:Inline-Flex - The inline version of flex allows the element, and it's children, to have flex properties while still remaining in the regular flow of the document/webpage. Basically, you can place two inline flex containers in the same row, if the widths were small enough, without any excess styling to allow them to exist in the same row. This is pretty similar to "inline-block."Flex - The container and it's children have flex properties but the container reserves the row, as it is taken out of the normal flow of the document. It responds like a block element, in terms of document flow. Two flexbox containers could not exist on the same row without excess styling.The problem you may be havingDue to the elements you listed in your example, though I am guessing, I think you want to use flex to display the elements listed in an even row-by-row fashion but continue to see the elements side-by-side.The reason you are likely having issues is because flex and inline-flex have the default "flex-direction" property set to "row." This will display the children side-by side. Changing this property to "column" will allow your elements to stack and reserve space(width) equal to the width of its parent.Below are some examples to show how flex vs inline-flex works and also a quick demo of how inline vs block elements work...FiddleFiddleFiddleFiddleFiddleFiddleAlso, a great reference doc:

A Complete Guide to Flexbox - css tricksDisplay:flex apply flex layout to the flex items or children of the container only. So, the container itself stays a block level element and thus takes up the entire width of the screen.This causes every flex container to move to a new line on the screen.Display:inline-flex apply flex layout to the flex items or children as well as to the container itself. As a result the container behaves as an inline flex element just like the children do and thus takes up the width required by its items/children only and not the entire width of the screen.This causes two or more flex containers one after another, displayed as inline-flex, align themselves side by side on the screen until the whole width of the screen is taken.You need a bit more information so that the browser knows what you want. For instance, the children of the container need to be told "how" to flex.Updated FiddleI've added #wrapper > * { flex: 1; margin: auto; } to your CSS and changed inline-flex to flex, and you can see how the elements now space themselves out evenly on the page.Open in Full page for better understanding

This solution also works, but still not quite what I'm looking for (I know I'm picky). I have two reservations: I know that trying to do this with CSS3 today may seem needless, but I have my reasons. I would also like to point out that this problem is a result of the w3c specification, not poor CSS3 support, so any solution will still be relevant and useful when CSS3 has more widespread support.

I would also like to point out that this problem is a result of the w3c specification, not poor CSS3 support, so any solution will still be relevant and useful when CSS3 has more widespread support.I figured it out. You just have to use some special selectors.The problem with rounding the corners of the table was that the td elements didn't also become rounded. You can solve that by doing something like this:Now everything rounds properly, except that there's still the issue of border-collapse: collapse breaking everything. A workaround is to add border-spacing: 0 and leave the default border-collapse: separate on the table.The following method works (tested in Chrome) by using a box-shadow with a spread of 1px instead of a "real" border.If you want a CSS-only solution (no need to set cellspacing=0 in the HTML) that allows for 1px borders (which you can't do with the border-spacing: 0 solution), I prefer to do the following:See a demo here.Given the following HTML:SEE example below:

Have you tried using table{border-spacing: 0} instead of table{border-collapse: collapse} ???You'll probably have to put another element around the table and style that with a rounded border.The working draft specifies that border-radius does not apply to table elements when the value of border-collapse is collapse.As Ian said, the solution is to nest the table inside a div and set it like that:With overflow:hidden, the square corners won't bleed through the div.To the best of my knowledge, the only way you could do it would be to modify all the cells like so:And then to get the border on the bottom and right back:last-child is not valid in ie6, but if you are using border-radius I assume you don't care.EDIT:After looking at your example page, it appears that you may be able to work around this with cell spacing and padding.  The thick gray borders you are seeing are actually the background of the table (you can see this clearly if you change the border color to red). If you set the cellspacing to zero (or equivalently: td, th { margin:0; }) the grey "borders" will disappear.EDIT 2:I can't find a way to do this with only one table. If you change your header row to a nested table, you might possibly be able to get the effect you want, but it'll be more work, and not dynamic.I tried a workaround using the pseudo elements :before and :after on the thead th:first-child and thead th:last-childIn combination with wrapping the table with a <div class="radius borderCCC">see jsFiddleWorks for me in chrome (13.0.782.215) Let me know if this works for you in other browsers.Actually you can add your table inside a div as its wrapper. and then assign these CSS codes to wrapper:The given answers only work when there are no borders around the table, which is very limiting!I have a macro in SASS to do this, which fully supports external and internal borders, achieving the same styling as border-collapse: collapse without actually specifying it.  Tested in FF/IE8/Safari/Chrome.Gives nice rounded borders in pure CSS in all browsers but IE8 (degrades gracefully) since IE8 doesn't support border-radius :(Some older browsers may require vendor prefixes to work with border-radius, so feel free to add those prefixes to your code as necessary.This answer is not the shortest - but it works.To apply this style simply change yourtag to the following:and be sure to include the above CSS styles in your HTML.Hope this helps.For a bordered and scrollable table, use this (replace variables, $ starting texts)If you use thead, tfoot or th, just replace tr:first-child and tr-last-child and td with them.HTML:I had the same problem.

remove border-collapse entirely and use: 

cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"

in the html document.

example:I just wrote a crazy set of CSS for this that seems to work perfectly:Solution with border-collapse:separate for table and display:inline-table for tbody and  thead.I am new with HTML and CSS and I was also looking for solution for this, here what I find.I try it, guess what it works :)Found this answer after running into the same problem, but found it's pretty simple: just give the table overflow:hiddenNo need for a wrapping element. Granted, I don't know if this would have worked 7 years ago when the question was initially asked, but it works now.Table with rounded corners and with bordered cells.

Using @Ramon Tayag solution.The key is to use border-spacing: 0 as he points out.Solution using SCSS.I started experiment with "display" and I found that: border-radius, border, margin, padding, in a table are displayed with:For example But we need set a width of every column Here is a recent example of how to implement a table with rounded-corners from http://medialoot.com/preview/css-ui-kit/demo.html.  It's based on the special selectors suggested by Joel Potter above.  As you can see, it also includes some magic to make IE a little happy.  It includes some extra styles to alternate the color of the rows:I always do this way using SassThe best solution so far comes from your own solution and it goes like this:Here is a way:OrBorder-radius is now officially supported.  So, in all of the above examples you may drop the "-moz-" prefix.Another trick is to use the same color for the top and bottom rows as is your border. With all 3 colors the same, it blends in and looks like a perfectly rounded table even though it isn't physically.

I am trying to add multiple classes to the className attribute on each li:My React component is:I use classnames when there is a fair amount of logic required for deciding the classes to (not) use. An overly simple example:That said, if you don't want to include a dependency then there are better answers below.I use ES6 template literals. For example:And then just render it:One-liner version:Just use JavaScript.If you want to add classes based keys and values in an object you can use the following:Or even simpler:No need to be fancy I am using CSS modules and it's easyThis will result in:In other words, both stylesIt would be easy to use the same idea with if'sThis can be achieved with ES6 template literals:You can create an element with multiple class names like this:Naturally, you can use a string containing the class names and manipulate this string to update the class names of the element.This is how you can do that with ES6:You can list multiple classes and conditions and also you can include static classes. It is not necessary to add an additional library.Good luck ;)No need for external libraries - just use ES6 template strings:Maybe classnames can help you.I don't think we need to use an external package for just adding multiple classes.I personally use or the second one in case you need to add or remove classes conditionally.Just adding, we can filter out empty strings.You can create an element with multiple class names like this, I tryed these both way, its working fine...

Auto-size dynamic text to fill fixed size container

[Auto-size dynamic text to fill fixed size container](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/687998/auto-size-dynamic-text-to-fill-fixed-size-container)

I need to display user entered text into a fixed size div.  What i want is for the font size to be automatically adjusted so that the text fills the box as much as possible.So - If the div is 400px x 300px.  If someone enters ABC then it's really big font.  If they enter a paragraph, then it would be a tiny font.I'd probably want to start with a maximum font size - maybe 32px, and while the text is too big to fit the container, shrink the font size until it fits.

If they enter a paragraph, then it would be a tiny font.I'd probably want to start with a maximum font size - maybe 32px, and while the text is too big to fit the container, shrink the font size until it fits.Thanks Attack. I wanted to use jQuery. You pointed me in the right direction, and this is what I ended up with:Here is a link to the plugin: https://plugins.jquery.com/textfill/

And a link to the source: http://jquery-textfill.github.io/and my html is like thisThis is my first jquery plugin, so it's probably not as good as it should be. Pointers are certainly welcome.I didn't find any of the previous solutions to be adequate enough due to bad performance, so I made my own that uses simple math instead of looping. Should work fine in all browsers as well.According to this performance test case it is much faster then the other solutions found here.If you want to contribute I've added this to Gist.As much as I love the occasional upvotes I get for this answer (thanks!), this is really not the greatest approach to this problem. Please check out some of the other wonderful answers here, especially the ones that have found solutions without looping.Still, for the sake of reference, here's my original answer:And here's a version with classes:Most of the other answers use a loop to reduce the font-size until it fits on the div, this is VERY slow since the page needs to re-render the element each time the font changes size. I eventually had to write my own algorithm to make it perform in a way that allowed me to update its contents periodically without freezing the user browser. I added some other functionality (rotating text, adding padding) and packaged it as a jQuery plugin, you can get it at:https://github.com/DanielHoffmann/jquery-bigtextsimply calland it will fit nicely on your container.See it in action here:http://danielhoffmann.github.io/jquery-bigtext/For now it has some limitations, the div must have a fixed height and width and it does not support wrapping text into multiple lines.I will work on getting an option to set the maximum font-size.Edit: I have found some more problems with the plugin, it does not handle other box-model besides the standard one and the div can't have margins or borders. I will work on it.Edit2: I have now fixed those problems and limitations and added more options. You can set maximum font-size and you can also choose to limit the font-size using either width, height or both. I will work into accepting a max-width and max-height values in the wrapper element.Edit3: I have updated the plugin to version 1.2.0. Major cleanup on the code and new options (verticalAlign, horizontalAlign, textAlign) and support for inner elements inside the span tag (like line-breaks or font-awesome icons.)This is based on what GeekyMonkey posted above, with some modifications.Here's an improved looping method that uses binary search to find the largest possible size that fits into the parent in the fewest steps possible (this is faster and more accurate than stepping by a fixed font size). The code is also optimized in several ways for performance.By default, 10 binary search steps will be performed, which will get within 0.1% of the optimal size. You could instead set numIter to some value N to get within 1/2^N of the optimal size.Call it with a CSS selector, e.g.: fitToParent('.title-span');I've created a directive for AngularJS - heavely inspired by GeekyMonkey's answer but without the jQuery dependency.Demo: http://plnkr.co/edit/8tPCZIjvO3VSApSeTtYr?p=previewMarkup<div class="fittext" max-font-size="50" text="Your text goes here..."></div>DirectiveI forked the script above from Marcus Ekwall: https://gist.github.com/3945316 and tweaked it to my preferences, it now fires when the window is resized, so that the child always fits its container. I've pasted the script below for reference.Here's my modification of the OP's answer.In short, many people who tried to optimize this complained that a loop was being used. Yes, while loops can be slow, other approaches can be inaccurate.Therefore, my approach uses Binary Search to find the best Font Size:This also allows the element to specify the minimum and maximum font:Furthermore, this algorithm is unitless. You may specify em, rem, %, etc. and it will use that for its final result.Here's the Fiddle: https://jsfiddle.net/fkhqhnqe/1/I had exactly the same problem with my website. I have a page that is displayed on a projector, on walls, big screens..As I don't know the max size of my font, I re-used the plugin above of @GeekMonkey but incrementing the fontsize :Here is a version of the accepted answer which can also take a minFontSize parameter.You can use FitText.js (github page) to solve this problem. Is really small and efficient compared to TextFill. TextFill uses an expensive while loop and FitText don't. Also FitText is more flexible (I use it in a proyect with very special requirements and works like a champ!).HTML:You also can set options to it:CSS:And if you need it, FitText also has a no-jQuery version.EDIT: This code was used to show notes on top of a HTML5 video. It changes the font-size on the fly when the video is resized (when the browser window is resized.) The notes was connected to the video (just like notes on YouTube), which is why the code uses instances instead of a DOM handle directly.As per request I'll throw in some code that I used to achieve this. (Text boxes over an HTML5 video.) The code was written a long time ago, and I quite frankly think it's pretty messy. Since the question is already answered and an answer is already accepted a long time ago I don't bother rewriting this. But if anyone wants to simplify this a bit, you're more than welcome!You'll probably need to tweak these numbers from font-family to font-family. A good way to do this is download a free graph visualizer called GeoGebra. Change the length of the text and the size of the box. Then you manually set the size. Plot the manual results into the coordinate system. Then you enter the two equations I've posted here and you tweak the numbers until "my" graph fits your own manually plotted points.The proposed iterative solutions can be sped up dramatically on two fronts:1) Multiply the font size by some constant, rather than adding or subtracting 1.2) First, zero in using a course constant, say, double the size each loop.  Then, with a rough idea of where to start, do the same thing with a finer adjustment, say, multiply by 1.1.  While the perfectionist might want the exact integer pixel size of the ideal font, most observers don't notice the difference between 100 and 110 pixels.  If you are a perfectionist, then repeat a third time with an even finer adjustment.Rather than writing a specific routine or plug-in that answers the exact question, I just rely on the basic ideas and write variations of the code to handle all kinds of layout issues, not just text, including fitting divs, spans, images,... by width, height, area,... within a container, matching another element....Here's an example:I got the same problem and the solution is basically use javascript to control font-size. 

Check this example on codepen: https://codepen.io/ThePostModernPlatonic/pen/BZKzVRThis is example is only for height, maybe you need to put some if's about the width.I did likeJust wanted to add my version for contenteditables.I have found a way to prevent the use of loops to shrink the text. It adjusts the font-size by multiplying it for the rate between container's width and content width. So if the container's width is 1/3 of the content, the font-size will be reduced by 1/3 and will container's width. To scale up, I have used a while loop, until content is bigger than container.This code is part of a test that I have uploaded to Github https://github.com/ricardobrg/fitText/I went with geekMonkey solution, but it's too slow. What he does, is he adjusts the font size to maximum (maxFontPixels) and then checks if it fits inside the container. else it reduces the font size by 1px and checks again. Why not simply check the previous container for the height and submit that value? (yes, I know why, but I now made a solution, that only works on the height and also has a min/max option)Here is a much quicker solution:and this would be the HTML:Again: this solution ONLY checks for the height of the container. That's why this function does not has to check, if the element fits inside. But I also implemented a min/max value (40min, 150max) so for me this works perfectly fine (and also works on window resize).This is the most elegant solution I have created. It uses binary search, doing  10 iterations. The naive way was to do a while loop and increase the font size by 1 until the element started to overflow. You can determine when an element begins to overflow using element.offsetHeight and element.scrollHeight. If scrollHeight is bigger than offsetHeight, you have a font size that is too big.Binary search is a much better algorithm for this. It also is limited by the number of iterations you want to perform. Simply call flexFont and insert the div id and it will adjust the font size between 8px and 96px.I have spent some time researching this topic and trying different libraries, but ultimately I think this is the easiest and most straightforward solution that will actually work.Note if you want you can change to use offsetWidth and scrollWidth, or add both to this function.Here is another version of this solution:

I am creating a mobile web page that is basically a big form with several text inputs.However (at least on my Android cellphone), every time I click on some input the whole page zooms there, obscuring the rest of the page. Is there some HTML or CSS command to disable this kind of zoom on moble web pages?This should be everything you need For those of you late to the party, kgutteridge's answer doesn't work for me and Benny Neugebauer's answer includes target-densitydpi (a feature that is being deprecated).This however does work for me: There are a number of approaches here- and though the position is that typically users should not be restricted when it comes to zooming for accessibility purposes, there may be incidences where is it required:Render the page at the width of the device, dont scale:Prevent scaling- and prevent the user from being able to zoom:Removing all zooming, all scalingYou can use:But please note that with Android 4.4 the property target-densitydpi is no longer supported. So for Android 4.4 and later the following is suggested as best practice:Since there is still no solution for initial issue, here's my pure CSS two cents.Mobile browsers (most of them) require font-size in inputs to be 16px. Sosolves the issue. So you don't need to disable zoom and loose accessibility features of you site.If your base font-size is not 16px or not 16px on mobiles, you can use media queries.please try adding this meta-tag and style Possible Solution for Web Apps: While zooming can not be disabled in iOS Safari anymore, it will be disabled when opening the site from a home screen shortcut.Add these meta tags to declare your App as "Web App capable":However only use this feature if your app is self sustaining, as the forward/backward buttons and URL bar aswell as the sharing options are disabled. (You can still swipe left and right though) This approach however enables quite the app like ux. The fullscreen browser only starts when the site is loaded from the homescreen. I also only got it to work after I included an apple-touch-icon-180x180.png in my root folder.As a bonus, you probably also want to include a variant of this aswell:You can accomplish the task by simply adding the following 'meta' element into your 'head':Adding all the attributes like 'width','initial-scale', 'maximum-width', 'maximum-scale' might not work. Therefore, just add the above element.Seems like just adding meta tags to index.html doesn't prevent page from zooming. Adding below style will do the magic. EDIT:

However, this will be shown only in one line.

But I would like it to be shown in multi-lines.It may looks like:There are also several jquery plugins that deal with this issue, but many do not handle multiple lines of text.  Following works:There also some preformance tests.I have hacked around until I've managed to achieve something close to this. It comes with a few caveats:I should also note that the text will be broken at a word boundary, not a character boundary. This was deliberate (since I consider that better for longer texts), but because it's different from what text-overflow: ellipsis does, I thought I should mention it.If you can live with these caveats, the HTML looks like this:And this is the corresponding CSS, using the example of a 150 pixel wide box with three lines of text on a white background. It assumes you have a CSS reset or similar that sets margins and paddings to zero where necessary.The result looks like this:To clarify how it works, here's the same image, except that .hidedots1 is hightlighted in red, and .hidedots2 in cyan. These are the rectangles that hide the ellipsis when there's no invisible text:Tested in IE9, IE8 (emulated), Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Opera. Does not work in IE7.Here's a recent css-tricks article which discusses this.Some of the solutions in the above article (which are not mentioned here) are1) -webkit-line-clamp and 2) Place an absolutely positioned element to the bottom right with fade outBoth methods assume the following markup:with cssline-clamp FIDDLE (..for a maximum of 3 lines)Fade out FIDDLEWe can use @supports to apply webkit's line-clamp on webkit browsers and apply fade out in other browsers.@supports line-clamp with fade fallback fiddle The link below provides a pure HTML / CSS solution to this problem.Browser support - as stated in the article:http://www.mobify.com/dev/multiline-ellipsis-in-pure-css(resize browser's window for testing)After looking over the W3 spec for text-overflow, I don't think this is possible using only CSS.  Ellipsis is a new-ish property, so it probably hasn't received much usage or feedback as of yet.However, this guy appears to have asked a similar (or identical) question, and someone was able to come up with a nice jQuery solution.  You can demo the solution here: http://jsfiddle.net/MPkSF/If javascript is not an option, I think you may be out of luck...Just want to add to this question for completeness sake. Great question... I wish there was an answer, but this is the closest you can get with CSS these days. No ellipsis, but still pretty usable.I've found this css (scss) solution that works quite well. On webkit browsers it shows the ellipsis and on other browsers it just truncates the text.

Every time I develop a new form that includes a textarea I have the following dilemma when I need to specify its dimensions:Use CSS or use the textarea's attributes cols and rows?What are the pros and cons of each method?What are the semantics of using these attributes?How is it usually done?I recommend to use both. Rows and cols are required and useful if the client does not support CSS. But as a designer I overwrite them to get exactly the size I wish. The recommended way to do it is via an external stylesheet e.g.In HTML setIn CSS set This will trigger the browser to set the height of the textarea EXACTLY to the amount of rows plus the paddings around it. Setting the CSS height to an exact amount of pixels leaves arbitrary whitespaces.According to the w3c, cols and rows are both required attributes for textareas.  Rows and Cols are the number of characters that are going to fit in the textarea rather than pixels or some other potentially arbitrary value.  Go with the rows/cols.The answer is "yes". That is, you should use both. Without rows and cols (and there are default values even if you don't use them explicitly) the textarea is unusably small if CSS is disabled or overriden by a user stylesheet. Always keep accessibility concerns in mind. That being said, if your stylesheet is allowed to control the appearance of the textarea, you will generally wind up with something that looks a whole lot better, fits into the overall page design well, and that can resize to keep up with user input (within the limits of good taste, of course).For text area we can use below css to fix size Tested in angularjs and angular7The size of a textarea can be specified by the cols and rows attributes, or even better; through CSS' height and width properties.

The cols attribute is supported in all major browsers.

One main difference is that <TEXTAREA ...> is a container tag: it has a start tag (). I usually don't specify height, but do specify width: ... and rows and cols.Usually, in my cases, only width and rows are needed, for the textarea to look nice in relation to other elems. (And cols is a fallback if someone doesn't use CSS, as explained in the other answers.)((Specifying both rows and height feels a little bit like duplicating data I think?))A major feature of textareas is that they are expandable. On a web page this can result in scroll bars appearing on the text area if the text length overfills the space you set (be that using rows, or be that using CSS. That can be a problem when a user decides to print, particularly with 'printing' to PDF - so set a comfortably large min-height for printed textareas with a conditional CSS rule:if you dont use  every time use  line-height:'..'; property its control the height of textarea and width property for width of textarea.or you can make use of  font-size by following css:HTML rows and cols are not responsive! So I define the size in CSS. As a tip: if you define a small size for mobiles think about using textarea:focus {};Add some extra space here, which will only unfold the moment a user wants to actually write something

That's why your columns are shrinking.It doesn't matter what width you specify (it could be width: 10000px), with flex-shrink the specified width can be ignored and flex items are prevented from overflowing the container.You will need to disable shrinking.

I would like to use media queries to resize elements based on the size of a div element they are in. I cannot use the screen size as the div is just used like a widget within the webpage, and its size can vary.Looks like there is work being done on this now:

https://github.com/ResponsiveImagesCG/cq-demosNo, media queries aren't designed to work based on elements in a page. They are designed to work based on devices or media types (hence why they are called media queries). width, height, and other dimension-based media features all refer to the dimensions of either the viewport or the device's screen in screen-based media. They cannot be used to refer to a certain element on a page.If you need to apply styles depending on the size of a certain div element on your page, you'll have to use JavaScript to observe changes in the size of that div element instead of media queries.I've just created a javascript shim to achieve this goal. Take a look if you want, it's a proof-of-concept, but take care: it's a early version and still needs some work.https://github.com/marcj/css-element-queriesA Media Query inside of an iframe can function as an element query. I've successfully implement this. The idea came from a recent post about Responsive Ads by Zurb. No Javascript!This is currently not possible with CSS alone as @BoltClock wrote in the accepted answer, but you can work around that by using JavaScript.I created a container query (aka element query) prolyfill to solve this kind of issue. It works a bit different than other scripts, so you don’t have to edit the HTML code of your elements. All you have to do is include the script and use it in your CSS like so:https://github.com/ausi/cq-prolyfillI ran into the same problem a couple of years ago and funded the development of a plugin to help me in my work. I've released the plugin as open-source so others can benefit from it as well, and you can grab it on Github: https://github.com/eqcss/eqcssThere are a few ways we could apply different responsive styles based on what we can know about an element on the page. Here are a few element queries that the EQCSS plugin will let you write in CSS:So what conditions are supported for responsive styles with EQCSS?Inside EQCSS element queries you can also use three special selectors that allow you to more specifically apply your styles:Element queries allow you to compose your layout out of individually responsive design modules, each with a bit of 'self-awareness' of how they are being displayed on the page.With EQCSS you can design one widget to look good from 150px wide all the way up to 1000px wide, then you can confidently drop that widget into any sidebar in any page using any template (on any site) and The question is very vague.  As BoltClock says, media queries only know the dimensions of the device.  However, you can use media queries in combination with descender selectors to perform adjustments.The only other solution requires JS.The only way I can think that you can accomplish what you want purely with css, is to use a fluid container for your widget. If your container's width is a percentage of the screen then you can use media queries to style depending on your container's width, as you will now know for each screen's dimensions what is your container's dimensions. For example, let's say you decide to make your container's 50% of the screen width. Then for a screen width of 1200px you know that your container is 600pxFrom a layout perspective, it is possible using modern techniques.Its made up (I believe) by Heydon Pickering. He details the process here: http://www.heydonworks.com/article/the-flexbox-holy-albatrossChris Coyier picks it up and works through a demo of it here: https://css-tricks.com/putting-the-flexbox-albatross-to-real-use/To restate the issue, below we see 3 of the same component, each made up of three orange divs labelled a, b and c.The second two's blocks display vertically, because they are limited on horizontal room, while the top components 3 blocks are laid out horizontally.It uses the flex-basis CSS property and CSS Variables to create this effect.DemoHeydon's article is 1000 words explaining it in detail, and I'd highly recommend reading it.I was also thinking of media queries, but then I found this:Just create a wrapper <div> with a percentage value for padding-bottom, like this:It will result in a <div> with height equal to 75% of the width of its container (a 4:3 aspect ratio).This technique can also be coupled with media queries and a bit of ad hoc knowledge about page layout for even more finer-grained control.It's enough for my needs. Which might be enough for your needs too.You can use the ResizeObserver API. It's still in it's early days so it's not supported by all browsers yet (but there several polyfills that can help you with that).Basically this API allow you to attach an event listener to the resize of a DOM element.Demo 1 - Demo 2For mine I did it by setting the div's max width, hence for small widget won't get affected and the large widget is resized due to the max-width style.

I have some CSS that looks like this: I would like to replace the image with an icon from Font Awesome.I do not see anyway to use the icon in CSS as a background image. Is this possible to do assuming the Font Awesome stylesheets/fonts are loaded before my CSS? You can't use text as a background image, but you can use the :before or :after pseudo classes to place a text character where you want it, without having to add all kinds of messy extra mark-up.Be sure to set position:relative on your actual text wrapper for the positioning to work.EDIT:Font Awesome v5 uses other font names than older versions:Note that you should set the same font-weight property, too (seems to be 900).Another way to find the font name is to right click on a sample font awesome icon on your page and get the font name (same way the utf-8 icon code can be found, but note that you can find it out on :before).Further to the answer from Diodeus above, you need the font-family: FontAwesome rule (assuming you have the @font-face rule for FontAwesome declared already in your CSS). Then it is a matter of knowing which CSS content value corresponds to which icon. I have listed them all here: http://astronautweb.co/snippet/font-awesome/Actually even font-awesome CSS has a similar strategy for setting their icon styles.  If you want to get a quick hold of the icon code, check the non-minified font-awesome.css file and there they are....each font in its purity.Consolidating everything above, the following is the final class which works wellYou can try this example class. and find icon content here: http://astronautweb.co/snippet/font-awesome/To use font awesome using css follow below steps - step 1 - Add Fonts of FontAwesome in CSSStep - 2 Use below css to apply font on class element of HTMLAnd finally, use "sorting_asc" class to apply the css on desired HTML tag/element.No need to embed content into the CSS. You can put the badge content inside the fa element, then adjust the badge css. http://jsfiddle.net/vmjwayrk/2/Alternatively, if using Sass, one can "extend" FA icons to display them:Example Link:

https://codepen.io/bungeedesign/pen/XqeLQgGet Icon code from:

https://fontawesome.com/cheatsheet?from=ioFor this you just need to add content attribute and font-family attribute to the required element via :before or :after wherever applicable.For example: I wanted to attach an attachment icon after all the a element inside my post. So, first I need to search if such icon exists in fontawesome. Like in the case I found it here, i.e. fa fa-paperclip. Then I would right click the icon there, and go the ::before pseudo property to fetch out the content tag it is using, which in my case I found to be \f0c6. Then I would use that in my css like this:Use the following Python program via command line to create png images from Font-Awesome icons:https://github.com/Pythonity/font-awesome-to-png

Is CSS Turing complete?

[Is CSS Turing complete?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2497146/is-css-turing-complete)

CSS isn't, insofar as I know, Turing complete.  But my knowledge of CSS is very limited.  

2010-03-23 02:20:30Z

CSS isn't, insofar as I know, Turing complete.  But my knowledge of CSS is very limited.  You can encode Rule 110 in CSS3, so it's Turing-complete so long as you consider an appropriate accompanying HTML file and user interactions to be part of the「execution」of CSS. A pretty good implementation is available, and another implementation is included here:One aspect of Turing completeness is that its halting problem is undecidable.This means there's no general algorithm for determining whether a CSS program will finish running or loop forever.But we can derive such an algorithm for CSS! Here it is:That's it. Since we just showed that the halting problem is decidable for CSS, it follows that CSS is not Turing complete.(Other people have mentioned IE 6, which allows for embedding arbitrary JavaScript expressions in CSS; that will obviously add Turing completeness. But that feature is non-standard, and nobody in their right mind uses it anyway.)Daniel Wagner brought up a point that I missed in the original answer. He notes that while I've covered animations, other parts of the style engine such as selector matching or layout can lead to Turing completeness as well. While it's difficult to make a formal argument about these, I'll try to outline why Turing completeness is still unlikely to happen.First: Turing complete languages have some way of feeding data back into itself, whether it be through recursion or looping. But the design of the CSS language is hostile to this feedback:That should be enough to convince you that selector matching, on its own, cannot be Turing complete. But what about layout?The modern CSS layout algorithm is very complex, with features such as Flexbox and Grid muddying the waters. But even if it were possible to trigger an infinite loop with layout, it would be hard to leverage this to perform useful computation. That's because CSS selectors inspect only the internal structure of the DOM, not how these elements are laid out on the screen. So any Turing completeness proof using the layout system must depend on layout alone.Finally – and this is perhaps the most important reason – browser vendors have an interest in keeping CSS not Turing complete. By restricting the language, vendors allow for clever optimizations that make the web faster for everyone. Moreover, Google dedicates a whole server farm to searching for bugs in Chrome. If there were a way to write an infinite loop using CSS, then they probably would have found it already 😉As per this article, it's not. The article also argues that it's not a good idea to make it one.To quote from one of the comments:Turing-completeness is not only about "defining functions" or "have ifs/loops/etc". For example, Haskell doesn't have "loop", lambda-calculus don't have "ifs", etc...For example, this site: http://experthuman.com/programming-with-nothing. The author uses Ruby and create a "FizzBuzz" program with only closures (no strings, numbers, or anything like that)...There are examples when people compute some arithmetical functions on Scala using only the type systemSo, yes, in my opinion, CSS3+HTML is turing-complete (even if you can't exactly do any real computation with then without becoming crazy) The fundamental issue here is that any machine written in HTML+CSS cannot evaluate infinitely many steps (i.e there can be no "real" recursion) unless the code is infinitely long. And the question will this machine reach configuration H in n steps or less is always answerable if n is finite.This answer is not accurate because it mix description of UTM and UTM itself (Universal Turing Machine).We have good answer but from different perspective and it do not show directly flaws in current top answer.First of all we can agree that human can work as UTM. This mean if we doThen CSS part is useless because all work can be done by Human who will do UTM part. Act of clicking can be UTM, because you do not click at random but only in specific places.Instead of CSS I could use this text (Rule 110):To guide my actions and result will be same. This mean this text UTM? No this is only input (description) that other UTM (human or computer) can read and run. Clicking is enough to run any UTM.Critical part that CSS lack is ability to change of it own state in arbitrary way, if CSS could generate clicks then it would be UTM. Argument that your clicks are "crank" for CSS is not accurate because real "crank" for CSS is Layout Engine that run it and it should be enough to prove that CSS is UTM.CSS is not a programming language, so the question of turing-completeness is a meaningless one. If programming extensions are added to CSS such as was the case in IE6 then that new synthesis is a whole different thing.CSS is merely a description of styles; it does not have any logic, and its structure is flat.

In this case when you resize your window you'll get a gap between top of the page and navbar. A proper solution looks like this:For bootstrap 3, the class navbar-static-top instead of navbar-fixed-top prevents this issue, unless you need the navbar to always be visible.a much more handy solution for your reference, it works perfect in all of my projects:change your first 'div' fromtoI am using jQuery to solve this problem. This is the snippet for BS 3.0.0:I've had good success with creating a dummy non-fixed nav bar right before my real fixed nav bar.The spacing works out great on all screen sizes.In my project derived from the MVC 5 tutorial I found that changing the body padding had no effect. The following worked for me:It resolves the cases where the navbar folds into 2 or 3 lines. This can be inserted into bootstrap.css anywhere after the lines

    body {

      margin: 0;

    }The bootstrap v4 starter template css uses:As seen on this example from Twitter, add this before the line that includes the responsive styles declarations:Like so:with navbar navbar-default everything works fine, but if you are using navbar-fixed-top you have to include custom style body { padding-top: 60px;} otherwise it will block content underneath. using percentage is much better solution than pixels.If needed you can still be explicit by adding different breakpoints as mentioned in another answer by @spajusTwo problems will happen here: To fix 1), as Martijn Burger said above, the bootstrap v4 starter template css uses:To fix 2) check out this issue.  This code mostly works (but not on 2nd click of same hash):This code animates A links with jQuery (not slim jQuery):The best solution I've found so far, that does not involve hard coding heights and breakpoints is to add an extra <nav... tag to the markup.By doing it this way the @media breakpoints are identical, the height is identical (provided your navbar-brand is the tallest object in the navbar but you can easily substitute another element in the non fixed-top navbar.Where this fails is with screen readers which will now present 2 navbar-brand elements.  This points at the need for a not-for-sr class to prevent that element from showing up for screen readers.  However that class does not exist  https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/utilities/screenreaders/I've tried to compensate for the screen reader issue with aria-hidden="true" but  https://www.accessibility-developer-guide.com/examples/sensible-aria-usage/hidden/ seems to indicate this will probably not work when the screen reader is in focus mode which is of course the only time you actually need it to work...EDIT: This solution is not viable for newer versions of Bootstrap, where the navbar-inverse and navbar-static-top classes are not available.Using MVC 5, the way I fixed mine, was to simply add my own Site.css, loaded after the others, with the following line:

body{padding: 0}and I changed the code in the beginning of _Layout.cshtml, to be:If your navbar is on the top of the page originally, set the value to 0. Otherwise, set the value for data-offset-topto the value of the content above your navbar.Meanwhile, you need to modify the css as such:Add this:you should add to not destroy a sticky footer or something elseAdd to your JS:you can set margin based on screen resolution

What does the following CSS rule do:And why do we need to use it?I won't be explaining how the floats work here (in detail), as this question generally focuses on Why use clear: both; OR what does clear: both; exactly do...I'll keep this answer simple, and to the point, and will explain to you graphically why clear: both; is required or what it does...Generally designers float the elements, left or to the right, which creates an empty space on the other side which allows other elements to take up the remaining space.Elements are floated when the designer needs 2 block level elements side by side. For example say we want to design a basic website which has a layout like below...Live Example of the demo image.Code For DemoNote: You might have to add header, footer, aside, section (and other HTML5 elements) as display: block; in your stylesheet for explicitly mentioning that the elements are block level elements.I have a basic layout, 1 header, 1 side bar, 1 content area and 1 footer.No floats for header, next comes the aside tag which I'll be using for my website sidebar, so I'll be floating the element to left.So as you note, the left floated div leaves the space to its right unused, which will allow the div after it to shift in the remaining space.Ok, so this is how block level elements behave when floated left or right, so now why is clear: both; required and why?So if you note in the layout demo - in case you forgot, here it is..I am using a class called .clear and it holds a property called clear with a value of both. So lets see why it needs both.I've floated aside and section elements to the left, so assume a scenario, where we have a pool, where header is solid land, aside and section are floating in the pool and footer is solid land again, something like this..So the blue water has no idea what the area of the floated elements are, they can be bigger than the pool or smaller, so here comes a common issue which troubles 90% of CSS beginners: why the background of a container element is not stretched when it holds floated elements.  It's because the container element is a POOL here and the POOL has no idea how many objects are floating, or what the length or breadth of the floated elements are, so it simply won't stretch.(Refer [Clearfix] section of this answer for neat way to do this. I am using an empty div example intentionally for explanation purpose)I've provided 3 examples above, 1st is the normal document flow where red background will just render as expected since the container doesn't hold any floated objects.In the second example, when the object is floated to left, the container element (POOL) won't know the dimensions of the floated elements and hence it won't stretch to the floated elements height.After using clear: both;, the container element will be stretched to its floated element dimensions.Another reason the clear: both; is used is to prevent the element to shift up in the remaining space.Say you want 2 elements side by side and another element below them... So you will float 2 elements to left and you want the other below them.Last but not the least, the footer tag will be rendered after floated elements as I've used the clear class before declaring my footer tags, which ensures that all the floated elements (left/right) are cleared up to that point.Coming to clearfix which is related to floats. As already specified by @Elky, the way we are clearing these floats is not a clean way to do it as we are using an empty div element which is not a div element is meant for. Hence here comes the clearfix.Think of it as a virtual element which will create an empty element for you before your parent element ends. This will self clear your wrapper element holding floated elements. This element won't exist in your DOM literally but will do the job.To self clear any wrapper element having floated elements, we can useNote the :after pseudo element used by me for that class. That will create a virtual element for the wrapper element just before it closes itself. If we look in the dom you can see how it shows up in the Document tree.So if you see, it is rendered after the floated child div where we clear the floats which is nothing but equivalent to have an empty div element with clear: both; property which we are using for this too. Now why display: table; and content is out of this answers scope but you can learn more about pseudo element here.Note that this will also work in IE8 as IE8 supports :after pseudo.Most of the developers float their content left or right on their pages, probably divs holding logo, sidebar, content etc., these divs are floated left or right, leaving the rest of the space unused and hence if you place other containers, it will float too in the remaining space, so in order to prevent that clear: both; is used, it clears all the elements floated left or right.Now what if you want to make the other div render below div1, so you'll use clear: both; so it will ensure you clear all floats, left or rightThe clear property indicates that the left, right or both sides of an element can not be adjacent to earlier floated elements within the same block formatting context. Cleared elements are pushed below the corresponding floated elements. Examples:CSS float and clearSample FiddleJust try to remove clear:both property from the div with class sample and see how it follows floating divs.Mr. Alien's answer is perfect, but anyway I don't recommend to use <div class="clear"></div> because it just a hack which makes your markup dirty. This is useless empty div in terms of bad structure and semantic, this also makes your code not flexible. In some browsers this div causes additional height and you have to add height: 0; which even worse. But real troubles begin when you want to add background or border around your floated elements - it just will collapse because web was designed badly. I do recommend to wrap floated elements into container which has clearfix CSS rule. This is hack as well, but beautiful, more flexible to use and readable for human and SEO robots.  When you want one element placed at the bottom other element you use this code in CSS.

It is used for floats.If you float content you can float left or right... so in a common layout you might have a left nav, a content div and a footer.To ensure the footer stays below both of these floats (if you have floated left and right) then you put the footer as clear: both.This way it will stay below both floats.(If you are only clearing left then you only really need to clear: left;.)Go through this tutorial:

I would like to show a div when someone hovers over an <a> element, but I would like to do this in CSS and not JavaScript. Do you know how this can be achieved?

I would like to show a div when someone hovers over an <a> element, but I would like to do this in CSS and not JavaScript. Do you know how this can be achieved?You can do something like this: 

This uses the adjacent sibling selector, and is the basis of the suckerfish dropdown menu. HTML5 allows anchor elements to wrap almost anything, so in that case the div element can be made a child of the anchor. Otherwise the principle is the same - use the :hover pseudo-class to change the display property of another element. jsfiddleSince this answer is popular I think a small explanation is needed. Using this method when you hover on the internal element, it wont disappear.

Because the .showme is inside .showhim it will not disappear when you move your mouse between the two lines of text (or whatever it is). These are example of quirqs you need to take care of when implementing such behavior.It all depends what you need this for. This method is better for a menu style scenario, while Yi Jiang's is better for tooltips.I found using opacity is better, it allows you to add css3 transitions to make a nice finished hover effect. The transitions will just be dropped by older IE browsers, so it degrades gracefully to.I'm by know means an expert, but I'm incredibly proud of myself for having worked something out about this code. If you do:(Note the '>') You can contain the whole thing in an a tag, then, as long as your trigger (which can be in it's own div, or straight up in the a tag, or anything you want) is physically touching the revealed div, you can move your mouse from one to the other.Maybe this isn't useful for a great deal, but I had to set my revealed div to overflow: auto, so sometimes it had scroll bars, which couldn't be used as soon as you move away from the div.In fact, after finally working out how to make the revealed div, (although it is now a child of the trigger, not a sibling), sit behind the trigger, in terms of z-index, (with a little help from this page: How to get a parent element to appear above child) you don't even have to roll over the revealed div to scroll it, just stay hovering over the trigger and use your wheel, or whatever.My revealed div covers most of the page, so this technique makes it a lot more permanent, rather than the screen flashing from one state to another with every move of the mouse. It's really intuitive actually, hence why I'm really quite proud of myself.The only downside is that you can't put links within the whole thing, but you can use the whole thing as one big link.This answer doesn't require that you know the what type of display (inline, etc.) the hideable element is supposed to be when being shown:This uses the adjacent sibling selector and the not selector. I would like to offer this general purpose template solution that expands on the correct solution provided by Yi Jiang's.The additional benefits include:In the html you place the following structure:In the css you place the following structure:As additional information.  When the popup contains information that you might want to cut and paste or contains an object that you might want to interact with then first replace:withAnd second, adjust the position of div.popup so that there is an overlap with div.information.  A few pixels is sufficient to ensure that the div.popup is can receive the hover when moving the cusor off div.information.This does not work as expected with Internet Explorer 10.0.9200 and does work as expected with Opera 12.16, Firefox 18.0 and Google Chrome 28.0.15.See fiddle http://jsfiddle.net/F68Le/ for a complete example with a popup multilevel menu.please test this codeThe + allow 'select' only first not nested element , the > select nested elements only - the better is to use ~ which allow to select arbitrary element which is child of parent hovered element. Using opacity/width and transition you can provide smooth appearFor me, if I want to interact with the hidden div without seeing it disappear each time I leave the triggering element (a in that case) I must add:Based on the main answer, this is an example, useful to display an information tooltip when clicking on a ? near a link:HTMLCSSCodePen :hover on div show text in another divDon't forget. if you are trying to hover around an image, you have to put it around a container. 

css:If you hover on this:This will show:From my testing using this CSS:  And this HTML:, it resulted that it does expand using the second , but does not expand using the first one. So if there is a div between the hover target and the hidden div, then it will not work.

How do you get the footer to stay at the bottom of a Web page?

I have a simple 2-column layout with a footer that clears both the right and left div in my markup.  My problem is that I can't get the footer to stay at the bottom of the page in all browsers.  It works if the content pushes the footer down, but that's not always the case. To get a sticky footer:Probably the most obvious and non-hacky way to go about a sticky footer would be to make use of the new css viewport units.Take for example the following simple markup:If the header is say 80px high and the footer is 40px high, then we can make our sticky footer with one single rule on the content div:Which means: let the height of the content div be at least 100% of the viewport height minus the combined heights of the header and footer.That's it.... and here's how the same code works with lots of content in the content div:NB:1) The height of the header and footer must be known2) Old versions of IE (IE8-) and Android (4.4-) don't support viewport units. (caniuse)3) Once upon a time webkit had a problem with viewport units within a calc rule. This has indeed been fixed (see here) so there's no problem there. However if you're looking to avoid using calc for some reason you can get around that using negative margins and padding with box-sizing -Like so:Solution inspired by Philip Walton's sticky footer. This solution is valid only for:It is based on the flex display, leveraging the flex-grow property, which allows an element to grow in either height or width (when the flow-direction is set to either column or row respectively), to occupy the extra space in the container.We are going to leverage also the vh unit, where 1vh is defined as: Therefore a height of 100vh it's a concise way to tell an element to span the full viewport's height.This is how you would structure your web page:In order to have the footer stick to the bottom of the page, you want the space between the body and the footer to grow as much as it takes to push the footer at the bottom of the page.Therefore our layout becomes:You can play with it at the JSFiddle.Be aware that Safari has a flawed implementation of the flex-shrink property, which allows items to shrink more than the minimum height that would be required to display the content.

To fix this issue you will have to set the flex-shrink property explicitly to 0 to the .content and the footer in the above example:You could use position: absolute following to put the footer at the bottom of the page, but then make sure your 2 columns have the appropriate margin-bottom so that they never get occluded by the footer.Here is a solution with jQuery that works like a charm. It checks if the height of the window is greater than the height of the body. If it is, then it changes the margin-top of the footer to compensate. Tested in Firefox, Chrome, Safari and Opera.If your footer already has a margin-top (of 50 pixels, for example) you will need to change the last part for:Set the CSS for the #footer to:You will then need to add a padding or margin to the bottom of your #sidebar and #content to match the height of #footer or when they overlap, the #footer will cover them.Also, if I remember correctly, IE6 has a problem with the bottom: 0 CSS. You might have to use a JS solution for IE6 (if you care about IE6 that is).A similar solution to @gcedo but without the need of adding an intermediate content in order to push the footer down. We can simply add margin-top:auto to the footer and it will be pushed to the bottom of the page regardless his height or the height of the content above.I have myself struggled with this sometimes and I always found that the solution with all those div's within each other was a messy solution. 

I just messed around with it a bit, and I personally found out that this works and it certainly is one of the simplest ways:What I like about this is that no extra HTML needs to be applied. You can simply add this CSS and then write your HTML as wheneverSince the Grid solution hasn't been presented yet, here it is, with just two declarations for the parent element, if we take the height: 100% and margin: 0 for granted:CSS :HTML:This should do the trick if you are looking for a responsive footer aligned at the bottom of the page,which always keeps a top-margin of 80% of the viewport height.Use absolute positioning and z-index to create a sticky footer div at any resolution using the following steps: Here is an example:For this question many of the answers I have seen are clunky, hard to implement and inefficient so I thought I'd take a shot at it and come up with my own solution which is just a tiny bit of css and htmlthis works by setting the height of the footer and then using css calc to work out the minimum height the page can be with the footer still at the bottom, hope this helps some people :)index.html:main.css:Source: https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-keep-your-footer-where-it-belongs-59c6aa05c59c/One solution would be to set the min-height for the boxes. Unfortunately it seems that it's not well supported by IE (surprise).None of these pure css solutions work properly with dynamically resizing content (at least on firefox and Safari) e.g., if you have a background set on the container div, the page and then resize (adding a few rows) table inside the div, the table can stick out of the bottom of the styled area, i.e., you can have half the table in white on black theme and half the table complete white because both the font-color and background color is white. It's basically unfixable with themeroller pages.Nested div multi-column layout is an ugly hack and the 100% min-height body/container div for sticking footer is an uglier hack.The only none-script solution that works on all the browsers I've tried: a much simpler/shorter table with thead (for header)/tfoot (for footer)/tbody (td's for any number of columns) and 100% height. But this have perceived semantic and SEO disadvantages (tfoot must appear before tbody. ARIA roles may help decent search engines though).Multiple people have put the answer to this simple problem up here, but I have one thing to add, considering how frustrated I was until I figured out what I was doing wrong.As mentioned the most straightforward way to do this is like so..However the property not mentioned in posts, presumably because it is usually default, is the position: static on the body tag. Position relative will not work!My wordpress theme had overridden the default body display and it confused me for an obnoxiously long time.An old thread I know, but if you are looking for a responsive solution, this jQuery addition will help: Full guide can be found here: https://pixeldesigns.co.uk/blog/responsive-jquery-sticky-footer/I have created a very simple library https://github.com/ravinderpayal/FooterJS It is very simple in use. After including library, just call this line of code. Footers can be dynamically changed by recalling above function with different parameter/id. Note:- You haven't to alter or add any CSS. Library is dynamic which implies that even if screen is resized after loading page it will reset the position of footer. I have created this library, because CSS solves the problem for a while but when size of display changes significantly,from desktop to tablet or vice versa, they either overlap the content or they no longer remains sticky.Another solution is CSS Media Queries, but you have to manually write different CSS styles for different size of screens while this library does its work automatically and is supported by all basic JavaScript supporting browser.Edit

CSS solution:Now, if the height of display is more than your content length, we will make footer fixed to bottom and if not, it will automatically appear in very end of display as you need to scroll to view this.And, it seems a better solution than JavaScript/library one.I wasn't having any luck with the solutions suggested on this page before but then finally, this little trick worked. I'll include it as another possible solution.Flex layout is preferred for natural header and footer heights. This flex solution is tested in modern browsers and actually works :) in IE11.See JS Fiddle.HTMLCSSFor me the nicest way of displaying it (the footer) is sticking to the bottom but not covering content all the time:jQuery CROSS BROWSER CUSTOM PLUGIN - $.footerBottom()Or use jQuery like I do, and set your footer height to auto or to fix, whatever you like, it will work anyway. this plugin uses jQuery selectors so to make it work, you will have to include the jQuery library to your file.Here is how you run the plugin. Import jQuery, copy the code of this custom jQuery plugin and import it after importing jQuery! It is very simple and basic, but important. When you do it, all you have to do is run this code:there is no need to place it inside the document ready event. It will run well as it is. It will recalculate the position of your footer when the page is loaded and when the window get resized.Here is the code of the plugin which you do not have to understand. Just know how to implement it. It does the job for you. However, if you like to know how it works, just look through the code. I left comments for you.The flex solutions worked for me as far as making the footer sticky, but unfortunately changing the body to use flex layout made some of our page layouts change, and not for the better. What finally worked for me was:I got this from ctf0's response at https://css-tricks.com/couple-takes-sticky-footer/If you don't want it using position fixed, and following you annoyingly on mobile, this seems to be working for me so far.Just set the html to min-height: 100%; and position: relative;, then position: absolute; bottom: 0; left: 0; on the footer. I then made sure the footer was the last element in the body.Let me know if this doesn't work for anyone else, and why. I know these tedious style hacks can behave strangely among various circumstances I'd not thought of.The trick is to fix the position of the footer while setting the bottom to 0. The simplest solution would be: See here this full simple example :  Try putting a container div (with overflow:auto) around the content and sidebar.If that doesn't work, do you have any screenshots or example links where the footer isn't displayed properly?

I need to dynamically load banner images into a HTML5 app and would like a couple of different versions to suit the screen widths. I can't correctly determine the phone's screen width, so the only way I can think of doing this is to add background images of a div and use @media to determine the screen width and display the correct image.For example:Is this possible, or does anyone have any other suggestions?No, @media rules and media queries cannot exist in inline style attributes as they can only contain property: value declarations. As the spec puts it:The only way to apply styles to an element only in certain media is with a separate rule in your stylesheet, which means you'll need to come up with a selector for it.A dummy span selector would look like this, but if you're targeting a very specific element you will need a more specific selector:ProblemNo, Media Queries cannot be used in this way SolutionBut if you want provided a specific behavior usable on the fly AND responsive, you can use the style markup and not the attribute.e.i.See the code working in live on CodePenIn my Blog for example, I inject a <style> markup in <head> just after <link> declaration for CSS and it's contain the content of a textarea provided beside of real content textarea for create extra-class on the fly when I wrote an artitle.Note : the scoped attribute is a part of HTML5 specification. If you do not use it, the validator will blame you but browsers currently not support the real purpose : scoped the content of <style> only on immediatly parent element and that element's child elements. Scoped is not mandatory if the <style> element is in <head> markup.UPDATE: I advice to always use rules in the mobile first way so previous code should be:Inline styles cannot currently contain anything other than declarations (property: value pairs).You can use style elements with appropriate media attributes in head section of your document.Yes, you can write media query in inline-css if you are using a picture tag. For different device sizes you can get different images.If you are using Bootstrap Responsive Utilities or similar alternative that allows to hide / show divs depending on the break points, it may be possible to use several elements and show the most appropriate. i.e.I tried to test this and it did not seem to work but I'm curious why Apple is using it.  I was just on https://linkmaker.itunes.apple.com/us/ and noticed in the generated code it provides if you select the 'Large Button' radio button, they are using an inline media query.note: added line-breaks for readability, original generated code is minifiedMedia Queries in style-Attributes are not possible right now.

But if you have to set this dynamically via Javascript.

You could insert that rule via JS aswell.This is as if the style was there in the stylesheet. So be aware of specificity.Hey I just wrote it.Now you can use <div style="color: red; @media (max-width: 200px) { color: green }"> or so.Enjoy.You can use image-set()Inline media queries are possible by using something like Breakpoint for SassThis blog post does a good job explaining how inline media queries are more manageable than separate blocks: There Is No BreakpointRelated to inline media queries is the idea of "element queries", a few interesting reads are:yes,you can do with javascript by the  window.matchMediaif you add the rule to the print.css file you don't have to use @media.I uncluded it in the smarty foreach i use to give some elements a background color.

For example, in this case, you could use both div[class~="foo"] and div.foo to get the same result.Some libraries I've been able to find :A helpful function can be made out of previous answers:Then just concat the function call into your query.Match against one class that has whitespace.you can find elements like this example (all css elements)

How do I get a div to float to the bottom of its container?

[How do I get a div to float to the bottom of its container?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/311990/how-do-i-get-a-div-to-float-to-the-bottom-of-its-container)

I have floated images and inset boxes at the top of a container using float:right (or left) many times. Recently I hit a need to float a div at the bottom right corner of another div with the normal text wrap that you get with float (text wrapped above and to the left only).I thought this must be relatively easy even though float has no bottom value but I haven't been able to do it using a number of techniques and searching the web hasn't come up with anything other than using absolute positioning but this doesn't give the correct word wrap behaviour.I had thought this would be a very common design but apparently it isn't. If nobody has a suggestion I'll have to break my text up into separate boxes and align the div manually but that is rather precarious and I'd hate to have to do it on every page that needs it.EDIT: Just a note for anyone who comes here. The question linked above as a duplicate is in fact not a duplicate. The requirement that text wrap around the inset element makes it completely different. In fact, the response to the top voted answer here makes it clear why the answer in the linked question is wrong as a response to this question. Anyway, there still doesn't appear to be a general solution to this problem but some of the solutions posted here and in the linked question may work for specific cases.

Anyway, there still doesn't appear to be a general solution to this problem but some of the solutions posted here and in the linked question may work for specific cases.Set the parent div to position: relative, then the inner div to... ...and there you go :)A way to make it work is the following:After struggling with various techniques for a couple of days I have to say that this appears to be impossible. Even using javascript (which I don't want to do) it doesn't seem possible.To clarify for those who may not have understood - this is what I am looking for: in publishing it is quite common to layout an inset (picture, table, figure, etc.) so that its bottom lines up with the bottom of the last line of text of a block (or page) with text flowing around the inset in a natural manner above and to the right or left depending on which side of the page the inset is on. In html/css it is trivial to use the float style to line up the top of an inset with the top of a block but to my surprise it appears impossible to line up the bottom of the text and inset despite it being a common layout task.I guess I'll have to revisit the design goals for this item unless anyone has a last minute suggestion.I have acheived this in JQuery  by putting  a zero width strut element above the float right, then sizing the strut (or pipe) according to parent height minus floated child's height.Before js kicks in I am using the position absolute approach, which works but allows text flow behind.  Therefore I switch to position static to enable the strut approach.

(header is the parent element, cutout is the one i want bottom right, and pipe is my strut)CSSThe pipe must come 1st, then the cutout, then the text in the HTML order.This puts a fixed div at the bottom of the page and fixes to the bottom as you scroll downPut the div in another div and set the parent div's style to position:relative; Then on the child div set the following CSS properties: position:absolute; bottom:0;If you're okay with only the bottom-most line of the text going to the side of the block (as opposed to completely around and underneath it, which you can't do without ending the block and starting a new one), it's not impossible to float a block to one of the bottom corners of a parent block. If you put some content in a paragraph tag within a block and want to float a link to the bottom right corner of the block, put the link within the paragraph block and set it to float: right, then put in a div tag with clear: both set just underneath the end of the paragraph tag. The last div is to make sure the parent tag surrounds the floated tags.If you want the text to wrap nicely:-I know that this stuff is old, but I recently ran into this problem. use absolute position divs advice is really silly, because the whole float thing kind of loses point with absolute positions.. now, I did not find an universal solution, but in a lot of cases prople use floating divs just to display something in a row, like a series of span elements. and you can't vertically align that. to achieve a similar effect you can do this: do not make the div float, but set it's display property to inline-block. then you can align it vertically however it pleases you. you just need to set parent's div property vertical-align to either top, bottom, middle or baselinei hope that helps someoneIf you set the parent element as position:relative, you can set the child to the bottom setting position:absolute; and bottom:0;With the introduction of Flexbox, this has become quite easy without much hacking. align-self: flex-end on the child element will align it along the cross-axis.Output:I would just do a table.And the CSS:See it in action:

http://jsfiddle.net/mLphM/1/I tried several of these techniques, and the following worked for me, so if all else here if all else fails then try this because it worked for me :). A chose this approach of @dave-kok. But it works only if the whole content suits without scrolling. I appreciate if somebody will improveHere is code  http://jsfiddle.net/d9t9joh2/This is now possible with flex box.

Just set the 'display' of parent div as 'flex' and set the 'margin-top' property to 'auto'.

This does not distort any property of both the div.Not sure, but a scenario posted earlier seemed to work if you use position: relative instead of absolute on the child div.And no tables...!I had been find this solution for a long time as well.

This is what I get:align-self: flex-end;link: https://philipwalton.github.io/solved-by-flexbox/demos/vertical-centering/

However, I can't remember from where I opened this link. Hope it helpsIf you need relative alignment and DIV's still aren't give you what you want, just use tables and set valign = "bottom" in the cell you want the content aligned to the bottom.  I know it's not a great answer to your question since DIV's are supposed to replace tables, but this is what I had to do recently with an image caption and it has worked flawlessly so far.I tried this scenario posted earlier also;The absolute positioning fixes the div to the lowest part of the browser upon loading the page, but when you scroll down if the page is longer it does not scroll with you. I changed the positioning to be relative and it works perfect. The div goes straight to the bottom upon load so you won't actually see it until you get to the bottom.One interesting approach is to stack a couple of right float elements on top of each other.Only problem is that this only works when you know the height of the box.Stu's answer comes the closest to working so far, but it still doesn't take into account the fact that your outer div's height may change, based on the way the text wraps inside of it. So, repositioning the inner div (by changing the height of the "pipe") only once won't be enough. That change has to occur inside of a loop, so you can continually check whether you've achieved the right positioning yet, and readjust if needed.The CSS from the previous answer is still perfectly valid:However, the Javascript should look more like this:I know it is a very old thread but still I would like to answer. If anyone follow the below css & html then it works. The child footer div will stick with bottom like glue.To use css margin-top property with purpose to set footer to the bottom of its container. And to use css  text-align-last property to set the footer contents at center.Pretty old question, but still ...

You can float a div to the bottom of the page like this:You can see where the magic happens. I think you could do the same for floating it to the bottom of a parent div.simple......in the html file right....have the "footer" (or the div you want at the bottom) at the bottom. So dont do this:DO THIS: (have the footer underneath.)After doing this then you can go the css file and have the "sidebar" float to the left. then have "content" float to the right then have "footer" clear both.that should work.did for me.I got this to work on the first try by adding position:absolute; bottom:0; to the div ID inside the CSS. I did not add the parent style position:relative;.It is working perfect in both Firefox and IE 8, have not tried it in IE 7 yet. an alternative answer is the judicious use of tables and rowspan. by setting all table cells on the preceeding line (except the main content one) to be rowspan="2" you will always get a one cell hole at the bottom of your main table cell that you can always put valign="bottom".You can also set its height to be the minimum you need for one line. Thus you will always get your favourite line of text at the bottom regardless of how much space the rest of the text takes up.I tried all the div answers, I was unable to get them to do what I needed.here is my solution:You could try using an empty element with a 1px width and floating it. Then clear the element you actually want to position and use the height of the empty element to control how far down it goes. http://codepen.io/cssgrid/pen/KNYrey/To put any element at the bottom of its container, just used this:

2010-01-28 18:00:49Z

I know how to make 2 divs float side by side, simply float one to the left and the other to the right. But how to do this with 3 divs or should I just use tables for this purpose?Just give them a width and float: left;, here's an example:The modern way is to use the CSS flexbox, see support tables.You can also use CSS grid, see support tables.It is same way as you do for the two divs, just float the third one to left or right too.float them all leftmake sure a width is specified that they can all fit in their container (either another div or the window), otherwise they will wrapthat code that someone posted up there, it did the trick!!!

when i paste it just before closing the Container DIV, it helps clear all subsequent DIVs from overlapping with the DIVs i've created side-by-side at the top!tadaa!! :)Float all three divs to the left. Like here:I usually just float the first to the left, the second to the right. The third automatically aligns between them then.the advantage of this way is you can set each column width independant of the other as long as you keep it under 100%, if you use 3 x 30% the remaining 10% is split as a 5% divider space between the collumnsyou can float: left for all of them and set the width to 33.333%try to add "display: block" to the styleI didn't see the bootstrap answer, so for what's it's worth:let Bootstrap figure out the percentages.

I like to clear both, just in case.I prefer this method, floats are poorly supported in older versions of IE (really?...)UPDATED :

Of course, to use this technique and due to the absolute positioning you need to enclose the divs on a container and do a postprocessing to define the height of if, something like this: Not the most amazing thing in the world, but at least doesn't break on older IEs. Float each div and set clear;both for the row. No need to set widths if you dont want to. Works in Chrome 41,Firefox 37, IE 11Click for JS FiddleHere's how I managed to do something similar to this inside a <footer> element:CSS:@Leniel this method is good but you need to add width to all the floating div's. I would say make them equal width or assign fixed width. Something likeyou may assign class names to each div rather than adding inline style, which is not a good practice.Be sure to use a clearfix div or clear div to avoid following content remains below these div's.

Floating elements within a div, floats outside of div. Why?

DavidR

[Floating elements within a div, floats outside of div. Why?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2062258/floating-elements-within-a-div-floats-outside-of-div-why)

Say you have a div, give it a definite width and put elements in it, in my case an img and another div. The idea is that the content of the container div will cause the container div to stretch out, and be a background for the content. But when I do this, the containing div shrinks to fit the non-floating objects, and the floating objects will be either all the way out, or half out, half in, and not have any bearing on the size of the big div.Why is this? Is there something I'm missing, and how can I get floated items to stretch out the height of a containing div?

Is there something I'm missing, and how can I get floated items to stretch out the height of a containing div?The easiest is to put overflow:hidden on the parent div and don't specify a height:Another way is to also float the parent div:Another way uses a clear element:CSSThe problem is that floating elements are out-of-flow:Therefore, they don't impact surrounding elements as an in-flow element would.This is explained in 9.5 Floats:This is also specified in 10.6 Calculating heights and margins. For "normal" blocks,A way to solve the problem is forcing some in-flow element to be placed below all floats. Then, the height of the parent will grow to wrap that element (and thus the floats too).This can be achieved using the clear property:So a solution is adding an empty element with clear: both as the last sibling of the floatsHowever, that is not semantic. So better generate a pseudo-element at the end of the parent:There are multiple variants of this approach, e.g. using the deprecated single colon syntax :after to support old browsers, or using other block-level displays like display: table.There is an exception to the problematic behavior defined at the beginning: if a block element establishes a Block Formatting Context (is a BFC root), then it will also wrap its floating contents.According to 10.6.7 'Auto' heights for block formatting context roots,Additionally, as explained 9.5 Floats, BFC roots are also useful because of the following:A block formatting context is established byNote those may have undesired collateral effects, like clipping overflowing content, calculating auto widths with the shrink-to-fit algorithm, or becoming out-of-flow. So the problem is that it's not possible to have an in-flow block-level element with visible overflow that establishes a BFC.Display L3 addresses these issues:Sadly, there is no browser support yet. Eventually we may be able to usePut your floating div(s) in a div and in CSS give it overflow:hidden;

it will work fine.W3Schools recommendation:put overflow: auto on parent element and it will "color" whole background including elements margins. Also floating elements will stay inside of border.http://www.w3schools.com/css/tryit.asp?filename=trycss_layout_clearfixThere's nothing missing. Float was designed for the case where you want an image (for example) to sit beside several paragraphs of text, so the text flows around the image. That wouldn't happen if the text "stretched" the container. Your first paragraph would end, and then your next paragraph would begin under the image (possibly several hundred pixels below).And that's why you're getting the result you are.In some cases, i.e. when (if) you're just using float to have elements flow on the same "line", you might use instead ofOtherwise, using a clear element at the end works, even if it may go against the grain to need an element to do what should be CSS work.Here's more modern approach: No more clearfixes. p.s. Using overflow: hidden; hides the box-shadow so... Thank you LSerni you solved it for me.To achieve this :You have to do this :As Lucas says, what you are describing is the intended behaviour for the float property. What confuses many people is that float has been pushed well beyond its original intended usage in order to make up for shortcomings in the CSS layout model.Have a look at Floatutorial if you'd like to get a better understanding of how this property works.

I need to make a button look like a link using CSS. The changes are done but when I click on it, it shows as if it's pushed as in a button. Any idea how to remove that, so that the button works as a link even when clicked?The code of the accepted answer works for most cases, but to get a button that really behaves like a link you need a bit more code. It is especially tricky to get the styling of focused buttons right on Firefox (Mozilla).The following CSS ensures that anchors and buttons have the same CSS properties and behave the same on all common browsers:The example above only modifies button elements to improve readability, but it can easily be extended to modify input[type="button"], input[type="submit"] and input[type="reset"] elements as well. You could also use a class, if you want to make only certain buttons look like anchors.See this JSFiddle for a live-demo.Please also note that this applies the default anchor-styling to buttons (e.g. blue text-color). So if you want to change the text-color or anything else of anchors & buttons, you should do this after the CSS above.The original code (see snippet) in this answer was completely different and incomplete.If you don't mind using twitter bootstrap I suggest you simply use the link class.I hope this helps somebody :) Have a nice day!try using the css pseudoclass :focusedit as for links and onclick events use (you shouldn’t use inline javascript eventhandlers, but for the sake of simplicity i will use them here):with this.href you can even access the target of the link in your function. return false will just prevent browsers from following the link when clicked.if javascript is disabled the link will work as a normal link and just load some/page.php—if you want your link to be dead when js is disabled use href="#"You can't style buttons as links reliably throughout browsers. I've tried it, but there's always some weird padding, margin or font issues in some browser. Either live with letting the button look like a button, or use onClick and preventDefault on a link.You can achieve this using simple css as shown in below example

They are supposed to prevent line breaks between words. They are not supposed to be used as non-collapsible space, that wouldn't be semantic.Turns out it needs to be specified via escaped unicode.

Given a template where the HTML cannot be modified because of other requirements, how is it possible to display (rearrange) a div above another div when they are not in that order in the HTML? Both divs contain data that varies in height and width.Hopefully it is obvious that the desired result is:When the dimensions are fixed it easy to position them where needed, but I need some ideas for when the content is variable. For the sake of this scenario, please just consider the width to be 100% on both.I am specifically looking for a CSS-only solution (and it will probably have to be met with other solutions if that doesn't pan out). There are other elements following this. A good suggestion was mentioned given the limited scenario I demonstrated—given that it might be the best answer, but I am looking to also make sure elements following this aren't impacted.

A good suggestion was mentioned given the limited scenario I demonstrated—given that it might be the best answer, but I am looking to also make sure elements following this aren't impacted.This solution uses only CSS and works with variable contentA CSS-only solution (works for IE10+) – use Flexbox's order property:Demo: http://jsfiddle.net/hqya7q6o/596/More info: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/orderAs others have said, this isn't something you'd want to be doing in CSS. You can fudge it with absolute positioning and strange margins, but it's just not a robust solution. The best option in your case would be to turn to javascript. In jQuery, this is a very simple task:or more generically:This can be done using Flexbox. Create a container that applies both display:flex and flex-flow:column-reverse.Sources:There is absolutely no way to achieve what you want through CSS alone while supporting pre-flexbox user agents (mostly old IE) -- unless:If the above are true then you can do what you want by absolutely positioning the elements --Again, if you don't know the height want for at least #firstDiv, there's no way you can do  what you want via CSS alone.  If any of this content is dynamic, you will have to use javascript.Here's a solution:But I suspect you have some content that follows the wrapper div...With CSS3 flexbox layout module, you can order divs.If you know, or can enforce the size for the to-be-upper element, you could use In your css and give the divs their position.otherwise javascript seems the only way to go:or something similar.edit: I just found this which might be useful: w3 document css3 move-toNegative top margins can achieve this effect, but they would need to be customized for each page.  For instance, this markup......and this CSS......would allow you to pull the second paragraph above the first.Of course, you'll have to manually tweak your CSS for different description lengths so that the intro paragraph jumps up the appropriate amount, but if you have limited control over the other parts and full control over markup and CSS then this might be an option.Well, with a bit of absolute positioning and some dodgy margin setting, I can get close, but it's not perfect or pretty:The "margin-top: 4em" is the particularly nasty bit: this margin needs to be adjusted according to the amount of content in the firstDiv. Depending on your exact requirements, this might be possible, but I'm hoping anyway that someone might be able to build on this for a solid solution.Eric's comment about JavaScript should probably be pursued.This can be done with CSS only! Please check my answer to this similar question:https://stackoverflow.com/a/25462829/1077230I don't want to double post my answer but the short of it is that the parent needs to become a flexbox element. Eg: (only using the webkit vendor prefix here.)Then, swap divs around by indicating their order with:In your CSS, float the first div by left or right. Float the second div by left or right same as first. Apply clear: left or right the same as the above two divs for the second div.For example:I was looking for a way to change the orders of the divs only for mobile version so then I can style it nicely. Thanks to nickf reply I got to make this piece of code which worked well for what I wanted, so i though of sharing it with you guys:A solution with a bigger browser support then the flexbox (works in IE≥9):In contrast to the display: table; solution this solution works when .wrapper has any amount of children.Just use flex for the parent div by specifying display: flex and flex-direction : column.

Then use order to determine which of the child div comes firstIf you just use css, you can use flex.CSS really shouldn't be used to restructure the HTML backend. However, it is possible if you know the height of both elements involved and are feeling hackish. Also, text selection will be messed up when going between the divs, but that's because the HTML and CSS order are opposite.Where XXX and YYY are the heights of firstDiv and secondDiv respectively. This will work with trailing elements, unlike the top answer.I have a much better code, made by me, it is so big, just to show both things... create a 4x4 table and vertical align more than just one cell.It does not use any IE hack, no vertical-align:middle; at all... It does not use for vertical centering display-table, display:table-rom; display:table-cell;It uses the trick of a container that has two divs, one hidden (position is not the correct but makes parent have the correct variable size), one visible just after the hidden but with top:-50%; so it is mover to correct position.See div classes that make the trick:

 BloqueTipoContenedor

   BloqueTipoContenedor_VerticalmenteCentrado

     BloqueTipoContenido_VerticalmenteCentrado_Oculto

     BloqueTipoContenido_VerticalmenteCentrado_VisiblePlease sorry for using Spanish on classes names (it is because i speak spanish and this is so tricky that if i use English i get lost).The full code:Little late to the party, but you can also do this:Or set an absolute position to the element and work off the margins by declaring them from the edge of the page rather than the edge of the object. Use % as its more suitable for other screen sizes ect. This is how i overcame the issue...Thanks, hope its what your looking for...For CSS Only solution

1. Either height of wrapper should be fixed or

2. height of second div should be fixedIt is easy with css, just use display:block and z-index propertyHere is an example:HTML:CSS:Edit: It is good to set some background-color to the div-s to see things properly.I have a simple way to do this.

I cannot add any container in the <td> (like div/span)I tried all the following but not working on Firefox (using 1.4.2 js):Note - I cannot de-register the click function for the anchor tag as it is registered dynamically. AND I HAVE TO SHOW THE LINK IN DISABLED MODE.You can't disable a link (in a portable way). You can use one of these techniques (each one with its own benefits and disadvantages).This should be the right way (but see later) to do it when most of browsers will support it:It's what, for example, Bootstrap 3.x does. Currently (2016) it's well supported only by Chrome, FireFox and Opera (19+). Internet Explorer started to support this from version 11 but not for links however it's available in an outer element like:With:We, probably, need to define a CSS class for pointer-events: none but what if we reuse  the disabled attribute instead of a CSS class? Strictly speaking disabled is not supported for <a> but browsers won't complain for unknown attributes. Using the disabled attribute IE will ignore pointer-events but it will honor IE specific disabled attribute; other CSS compliant browsers will ignore unknown disabled attribute and honor pointer-events. Easier to write than to explain:Another option for IE 11 is to set display of link elements to block or inline-block:Note that this may be a portable solution if you need to support IE (and you can change your HTML) but...All this said please note that pointer-events disables only...pointer events. Links will still be navigable through keyboard then you also need to apply one of the other techniques described here.In conjunction with above described CSS technique you may use tabindex in a non-standard way to prevent an element to be focused:I never checked its compatibility with many browsers then you may want to test it by yourself before using this. It has the advantage to work without JavaScript. Unfortunately (but obviously) tabindex cannot be changed from CSS.Use a href to a JavaScript function, check for the condition (or the disabled attribute itself) and do nothing in case.To disable links do this:To re-enable them:If you want instead of .is("[disabled]") you may use .attr("disabled") != undefined (jQuery 1.6+ will always return undefined when the attribute is not set) but is() is much more clear (thanks to Dave  Stewart for this tip). Please note here I'm using the disabled attribute in a non-standard way, if you care about this then replace attribute with a class and replace .is("[disabled]") with .hasClass("disabled") (adding and removing with addClass() and removeClass()).Zoltán Tamási noted in a comment that "in some cases the click event is already bound to some "real" function (for example using knockoutjs) In that case the event handler ordering can cause some troubles. Hence I implemented disabled links by binding a return false handler to the link's touchstart, mousedown and keydown events. It has some drawbacks (it will prevent touch scrolling started on the link)" but handling keyboard events also has the benefit to prevent keyboard navigation.Note that if href isn't cleared it's possible for the user to manually visit that page.Clear the href attribute. With this code you do not add an event handler but you change the link itself. Use this code to disable links:And this one to re-enable them:Personally I do not like this solution very much (if you do not have to do more with disabled links) but it may be more compatible because of various way to follow a link.Add/remove an onclick function where you return false, link won't be followed. To disable links:To re-enable them:I do not think there is a reason to prefer this solution instead of the first one.Styling is even more simple, whatever solution you're using to disable the link we did add a disabled attribute so you can use following CSS rule:If you're using a class instead of attribute:If you're using an UI framework you may see that disabled links aren't styled properly. Bootstrap 3.x, for example, handles this scenario and button is correctly styled both with disabled attribute and with .disabled class. If, instead, you're clearing the link (or using one of the others JavaScript techniques) you must also handle styling because an <a> without href is still painted as enabled. Do not forget to also include an attribute aria-disabled="true" together with disabled attribute/class.Got the fix in css. Above css when applied to the anchor tag will disable the click event.For details checkout this linkThanks to everyone that posted solutions (especially @AdrianoRepetti), I combined multiple approaches to provide some more advanced disabled functionality (and it works cross browser). The code is below (both ES2015 and coffeescript based on your preference).This provides for multiple levels of defense so that Anchors marked as disable actually behave as such.

Using this approach, you get an anchor that you cannot:npm install -S key.jsTry the element:Disabling a link works for me in Chrome: http://jsfiddle.net/KeesCBakker/LGYpz/.Firefox doesn't seem to play nice. This example works:Note: added a 'live' statement for future disabled / enabled links.

Note2: changed 'live' into 'on'.I've ended up with the solution below, which can work with either an attribute, <a href="..." disabled="disabled">, or a class <a href="..." class="disabled">:CSS Styles:Javascript (in jQuery ready):Bootstrap 4.1 provides a class named disabled and aria-disabled="true" attribute.example"More is on getbootstrap.comSo if you want to make it dynamically, and you don't want to care if it is button or ancor than

in JS script you need something like thatBut be carefullThe solution only works on links with classes btn btn-link.Sometimes bootstrap recommends using card-link class, in this case solution will not work.you cannot disable a link, if you want that click event should not fire then simply Remove the action from that link.For More Info :-  Elements that can be DisabledI would do something likesomething like this should work. You add a class for links you want to have disabled and then you return false when someone click them. To enable them just remove the class.To disable link to access another page on touch device:In Razor (.cshtml) you can do:You can use this to disabled the Hyperlink of asp.net or link buttons in html.There is one other possible way, and the one that I like best. Basically it's the same way lightbox disables a whole page, by placing a div and fiddling with z-index. Here is relevant snippets from a project of mine. This works in all browsers!!!!!Javascript (jQuery):and in htmlSo the resizer finds the anchor's (the images are just arrows) locations and places the disabler on top. The disabler's image is a translucent grey square (change the width/height of the disablers in the html to match your link) to show that it is disabled. The floating allows the page to resize dynamically, and the disablers will follow suit in windowResizer(). You can find suitable images through google. I have placed the relevant css inline for simplicity.then based on some condition, I think a lot of these are over thinking. Add a class of whatever you want, like disabled_link. Then make the css have .disabled_link { display: none }

Boom now the user can't see the link so you won't have to worry about them clicking it. If they do something to satisfy the link being clickable, simply remove the class with jQuery: $("a.disabled_link").removeClass("super_disabled"). Boom done!

Fit cell width to content

JSfiddle of the example.HTML:CSS:Settingwill solve your problem.For me, this is the best autofit and autoresize for table and its columns (use css !important ... only if you can't without)Don't specify css width for table or for table columns.

If table content is larger it will go over screen size to.Setting CSS width to 1% or 100% of an element according to all specs I could find out is related to the parent. Although Blink Rendering Engine (Chrome) and Gecko (Firefox) at the moment of writing seems to handle that 1% or 100% (make a columns shrink or a column to fill available space) well, it is not guaranteed according to all CSS specifications I could find to render it properly.One option is to replace table with CSS4 flex divs:https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/That works in new browsers i.e. IE11+ see table at the bottom of the article.There are many ways to do this!correct me if I'm wrong but the question is looking for this kind of result.The first 2 fields will "share" the remaining page (NOTE: if you add more text to either 50% fields it will take more space), and the last field will dominate the table constantly.If you are happy to let text wrap you can move white-space:nowrap; to the style of the 3rd field  will be the only way to start a new line in that field.alternatively, you can set a length on the last field ie. width:150px, and leave percentage's on the first 2 fields.Hope this helps!Simple :

If so how can I do this?If you want two classes on one element, do it this way:Reference it in css like so:Example:https://jsfiddle.net/tybro0103/covbtpaq/You can try this:HTMLCSS CODETo add multiple class in the same element you can use the following format:DEMORemember that you can apply multiple classes to an element by separating each class with a space within its class attribute. For example:If you only have two items, you can do this:If you have 2 classes i.e. .indent and .font, class="indent font" works. You dont have to have a .indent.font{} in css. You can have the classes separate in css and still call both just using the class="class1 class2" in the html. You just need a space between one or more class names.If you want to apply styles only to an element which is its parents' first child, is it better to use :first-child pseudo-classThen, the rule .social has both common styles and the last element's styles.And .social:first-child overrides them with first element's styles.You could also use :last-child selector, but :first-childis more supported by old browsers: see

In your style sheet:But it may be a bad way to use selectors. Also, if you need multiple "first" extension, you'll have to be sure to set different name, or to refine your selector.I hope this will help someone, it can be pretty handy in some situation.For exemple, if you have a tiny piece of css that has to be linked to many different components, and you don't want to write a hundred time the same code.Becomes:Another option is to use Descendant selectorsHTML:Reference first one in CSS: .social .first { color: blue; }Reference last one in CSS: .social .last { color: green; }Jsfiddle: https://jsfiddle.net/covbtpaq/153/Instead of using multiple CSS classes, to address your underlying problem you can use the :focus pseudo-selector:

Otherwise your above code would have worked perfectly!I would comment if i could , but i have no permissions yet, so i will post a hint as an answer, for unexpected behavior on some android devices:Position: Fixed only works in Android 2.1 thru 2.3 by using the following meta tag: see http://caniuse.com/#search=positionThis is an intuitive solution using the viewport command that just sets the minimum height to the viewport height minus the footer height.I've solved a similar issue by putting all of my main content within an extra div tag (id="outer").  I've then moved the div tag with id="footer" outside of this last "outer" div tag.

I've used CSS to specify the height of "outer" and specified the width and height of "footer".  I've also used CSS to specify the margin-left and margin-right of "footer" as auto.  The result is that the footer sits firmly at the bottom of my page and scrolls with the page too (although, it's still appears inside the "outer" div, but happily outside of the main "content" div. which seems strange, but it's where I want it).I just want to add - most of the other answers worked fine for me; however, it took a long time to get them working!This is because setting height: 100% only picks up parent div's height!So if your entire html (inside of the body) looks like the following:Then the following will be fine:...as "holder" will pick up it's height directly from "body".Kudos to My Head Hurts, whose answer was the one I ended up getting to work!However. If your html is more nested (because it's only an element of the full page, or it's within a certain column, etc) then you need to make sure every containing element also has height: 100% set on the div. Otherwise, the information on height will be lost between "body" and "holder".E.g. the following, where I've added the "full height" class to every div to make sure the height gets all the way down to our header/body/footer elements:And remember to set height on full-height class in the css:That fixed my issues!if you have a fixed height footer (for example 712px) you can do this with js like so:use fixed-bottom bootstrap class

As Devon Sans points out in the comments: This feature will most likely be deprecated.From  Angular 4.3.0, all piercing css combinartors were deprecated. Angular team introduced a new combinator ::ng-deep  (still it is at experimental level and not the full and final way) as shown below,DEMO : https://plnkr.co/edit/RBJIszu14o4svHLQt563?p=previewYou can use encapsulation mode and/or piercing CSS combinators >>>, /deep/ and ::shadowworking example : http://plnkr.co/edit/1RBDGQ?p=previewUPDATE 3:::ng-deep is also deprecated which means you should not do this at all anymore. It is unclear how this affects things where you need to override styles in child components from a parent component. To me it seems odd if this gets removed completely because how would this affect things as libraries where you need to override styles in a library component?Comment if you have any insight in this.UPDATE 2:Since /deep/ and all other shadow piercing selectors are now deprecated. Angular dropped ::ng-deep which should be used instead for a broader compatibility. UPDATE:If using Angular-CLI you need to use /deep/ instead of >>> or else it will not work. ORIGINAL:After going to Angular2's Github page and doing a random search for "style" I found this question: Angular 2 - innerHTML stylingWhich said to use something that was added in 2.0.0-beta.10, the >>> and ::shadow selectors. So simply doing:In parent's stylesheet file solved the issue. Please note, as stated in the quote above, this solution is only intermediate until more advanced cross-component styling is supported.You should NOT use ::ng-deep, it is deprecated. In Angular, the proper way to change the style of children's component from the parent is to use encapsulation (read the warning below to understand the implications):And then, you will be able to modify the css form your component without a need from ::ng-deepWARNING: Doing this will make all css rules you write for this component to be global.In order to limit the scope of your css to this component only, add a css class to the top tag of your component and put your css "inside" this tag:Scss file:Sadly it appears that the /deep/ selector is deprecated (at least in Chrome)

https://www.chromestatus.com/features/6750456638341120In short it appears there is (currently) no long term solution other than to somehow get your child component to style things dynamically.

 You could pass a style object to your child and have it applied via:

<div [attr.style]="styleobject">

Or if you have a specific style you can use something like:

<div [style.background-color]="colorvar">More discussion related to this:

https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/6511Had same issue, so if you're using angular2-cli with scss/sass use '/deep/' instead of '>>>', last selector isn't supported yet (but works great with css).If you want to be more targeted to the actual child component than you should do the follow. This way, if other child components share the same class name, they won't be affected. Plunker:

https://plnkr.co/edit/ooBRp3ROk6fbWPuToytO?p=previewFor example:Hope this helps!codematrixActually there is one more option. Which is rather safe. You can use ViewEncapsulation.None BUT put all your component styles into its tag (aka selector). But anyway always prefer some global style plus encapsulated styles.Here is modified Denis Rybalka example:There are a few options to achieve this in Angular:1) You can use deep css selectors2) You can also change view encapsulation it's set to Emulated as a default but can be easily changed to Native which uses Shadow DOM native browser implementation, in your case you just need to disable it For example:`You should not write CSS rules for a child component elements in a parent component, since an Angular component is a self-contained entity which should explicitly declare what is available for the outside world. If child layout changes in the future, your styles for that child component elements scattered across other components' SCSS files could easily break, thus making your styling very fragile. That's what ViewEncapsulation is for in the case of CSS. Otherwise, it would be the same if you could assign values to private fields of some class from any other class in Object Oriented Programming.Therefore, what you should do is to define a set of classes you could apply to the child host element and implement how the child responds to them.Technically, it could be done as follows:In other words, you use :host pseudo-selector provided by Angular + set of CSS classes to define possible child styles in child component itself. You then have the ability to trigger those styles from outside by applying pre-defined classes to the <child> host element.I find it a lot cleaner to pass an @INPUT variable if you have access to the child component code:The idea is that the parent tells the child what its state of appearance should be, and the child decides how to display the state. It's a nice architecture SCSS Way:Better way: - use selected variable:The quick answer is you shouldn't be doing this, at all. It breaks component encapsulation and undermines the benefit you're getting from self-contained components. Consider passing a prop flag to the child component, it can then decide itself how to render differently or apply different CSS, if necessary.Angular is deprecating all ways of affecting child styles from parents.https://angular.io/guide/component-styles#deprecated-deep--and-ng-deepi also had this problem and didnt wanted to use deprecated solution 

so i ended up with:in parrentchild componentin child in html divand in codeworks like expected and should not be deprecated ;)As the internet updates I've come across a solution.First some caveats.First, mark your child component's encapsulation as shadow so it renders in the actual shadow dom. Second, add the part attribute to the element you wish to allow the parent to style. In your parent's component stylesheet you can use the ::part() method to accessI propose an example to make it more clear, since angular.io/guide/component-styles states:On app.component.scss, import your *.scss if needed. _colors.scss has some common color values:Apply a rule to all componentsAll the buttons having btn-red class will be styled.Apply a rule to a single componentAll the buttons having btn-red class on app-login component will be styled.I have solved it outside Angular. I have defined a shared scss that I'm importing to my children.shared.scsschild.scssMy proposed approach is a way how to solve the problem the OP has asked about. As mentioned at multiple occasions, ::ng-deep, :ng-host will get depreciated and disabling encapsulation is just too much of a code leakage, in my view.

But I don't know how to make the font bold, can anyone help me?You can use the CSS declaration font-weight: bold;.I would advise you to read the CSS beginner guide at http://htmldog.com/guides/cssbeginner/ .You can use the strong element in html, which is great semantically (also good for screen readers etc.), which typically renders as bold text:Or you can use the font-weight css property to style any element's text as bold:You'd use font-weight: bold.Do you want to make the entire document bold? Or just parts of it?Sine you are new to html here are three ready to use examples on how to use CSS together with html. You can simply put them into a file, save it and open it up with the browser of your choice:This one directly embeds your CSS style into your tags/elements. Generally this is not a very nice approach, because you should always separate the content/html from design. The next one is a more general approach and works on all "p" (stands for paragraph) tags in your document and additionaly makes them HUGE. Btw. Google uses this approach on his search:You probably will take a couple of days playing around with the first examples, however here is the last one. In this you finally fully seperate design (css) and content (html) from each other in two different files. stackoverflow takes this approach.In one file you put all the CSS (call it 'hello_world.css'):In another file you should put the html (call it 'hello_world.html'):Hope this helps a little. To address specific elements in your document and not all tags you should make yourself familiar with the class, id and name attributes. Have fun!Use the CSS font-weight propertySuppose you want to make bold for p elementYou can use other alternative value instead of bold likefont-weight: bold;You could use a couple approaches. First would be to use the strong tagAnother approach would be to use the font-weight property. You can achieve inline, or via a class or id. Let's say you're using a class. Alternatively, you can also use a hard value for font-weight and most fonts support a value between 300 and 700, incremented by 100. For example, the following would be bold:

Thought this'd be a quick fix for now but obviously not.Thanks.Span is an inline element. It has no width or height.You could turn it into a block-level element, then it will accept your dimension directives.Try using a div instead of the span or using the CSS display: block; or display: inline-block;—span is by default an inline element which cannot take width and height properties.Inspired from @Hamed, I added the following and it worked for me:Span takes width and height only when we make it block element.As per comment from @Paul, If display: block is specified, span stops to be an inline element and an element after it appears on next line.I came here to find solution to my span height problem and I got a solution of my ownAdding overflow:hidden; and keeing it inline will solve the problem just tested in IE8 Quirks modespans are by default displayed inline, which means they don't have a height and width.Try adding a display: block to your span.Span starts out as an inline element.  You can change its display attribute to block, for instance, and its height/width attributes will start to take effect.span {display:block;} also adds a line-break.To avoid that, use span {display:inline-block;} and then you can add width and height to the inline element, and you can align it within the block as well:more here

If not, I'll terribly miss flash and its high level of configuration on textfields...UPDATE January, 2017:According to Can I use, the user-select is currently supported in all browsers except Internet Explorer 9 and earlier versions (but sadly still needs a vendor prefix).All of the correct CSS variations are:Note that it's a non-standard feature (i.e. not a part of any specification).

You really shouldn't be screwing with the client's user agent in this manner. If the client wants to select things on the document, then they should be able to select things on the document. It doesn't matter if you don't like the highlight color, because you aren't the one viewing the document.I'm not sure if you can turn it off, but you can change the colors of it :)Then just match the colors to your "darky" design and see what happens :)

Load and execution sequence of a web page?

Does this vary in different browsers? Any reference about this question?Thanks.EDIT:I did an experiment in Firefox with Firebug. And it shows as the following image:

According to your sample,roughly the execution flow is about as follows:Note that the download may be asynchronous and non-blocking due to behaviours of the browser. For example, in Firefox there is this setting which limits the number of simultaneous requests per domain.Also depending on whether the component has already been cached or not, the component may not be requested again in a near-future request. If the component has been cached, the component will be loaded from the cache instead of the actual URL.When the parsing is ended and document is ready and loaded, the events onload is fired. Thus when onload is fired, the $("#img").attr("src","kkk.png"); is run. So:The $(document).ready() event is actually the event fired when all page components are loaded and ready. Read more about it: http://docs.jquery.com/Tutorials:Introducing_$(document).ready()By default, and from my current understanding, browser usually runs each page on 3 ways: HTML parser, Javascript/DOM, and CSS. The HTML parser is responsible for parsing and interpreting the markup language and thus must be able to make calls to the other 2 components. For example when the parser comes across this line:The parser will make 3 calls, two to Javascript and one to CSS. Firstly, the parser will create this element and register it in the DOM namespace, together with all the attributes related to this element. Secondly, the parser will call to bind the onclick event to this particular element. Lastly, it will make another call to the CSS thread to apply the CSS style to this particular element.The execution is top down and single threaded. Javascript may look multi-threaded, but the fact is that Javascript is single threaded. This is why when loading external javascript file, the parsing of the main HTML page is suspended. However, the CSS files can be download simultaneously because CSS rules are always being applied - meaning to say elements are always repainted with the freshest CSS rules defined - thus making it unblocking.An element will only be available in the DOM after it has been parsed. Thus when working with a specific element, the script is always placed after, or within the window onload event.Script like this will cause error (on jQuery):Because when the script is parsed, #mydiv element is still not defined. Instead this would work:OR1) HTML is downloaded.2) HTML is parsed progressively.  When a request for an asset is reached the browser will attempt to download the asset.  A default configuration for most HTTP servers and most browsers is to process only two requests in parallel.  IE can be reconfigured to downloaded an unlimited number of assets in parallel.  Steve Souders has been able to download over 100 requests in parallel on IE.  The exception is that script requests block parallel asset requests in IE.  This is why it is highly suggested to put all JavaScript in external JavaScript files and put the request just prior to the closing body tag in the HTML.3) Once the HTML is parsed the DOM is rendered.  CSS is rendered in parallel to the rendering of the DOM in nearly all user agents.  As a result it is strongly recommended to put all CSS code into external CSS files that are requested as high as possible in the <head></head> section of the document.  Otherwise the page is rendered up to the occurance of the CSS request position in the DOM and then rendering starts over from the top.4) Only after the DOM is completely rendered and requests for all assets in the page are either resolved or time out does JavaScript execute from the onload event.  IE7, and I am not sure about IE8, does not time out assets quickly if an HTTP response is not received from the asset request.  This means an asset requested by JavaScript inline to the page, that is JavaScript written into HTML  tags that is not contained in a function, can prevent the execution of the onload event for hours.  This problem can be triggered if such inline code exists in the page and fails to execute due to a namespace collision that causes a code crash.Of the above steps the one that is most CPU intensive is the parsing of the DOM/CSS.  If you want your page to be processed faster then write efficient CSS by eliminating redundent instructions and consolidating CSS instructions into the fewest possible element referrences.  Reducing the number of nodes in your DOM tree will also produce faster rendering.Keep in mind that each asset you request from your HTML or even from your CSS/JavaScript assets is requested with a separate HTTP header.  This consumes bandwidth and requires processing per request.  If you want to make your page load as fast as possible then reduce the number of HTTP requests and reduce the size of your HTML.  You are not doing your user experience any favors by averaging page weight at 180k from HTML alone.  Many developers subscribe to some fallacy that a user makes up their mind about the quality of content on the page in 6 nanoseconds and then purges the DNS query from his server and burns his computer if displeased, so instead they provide the most beautiful possible page at 250k of HTML.  Keep your HTML short and sweet so that a user can load your pages faster.  Nothing improves the user experience like a fast and responsive web page.Open your page in Firefox and get the HTTPFox addon. It will tell you all that you need.Found this on archivist.incuito:http://archivist.incutio.com/viewlist/css-discuss/76444If you're asking this because you want to speed up your web site, check out Yahoo's page on Best Practices for Speeding Up Your Web Site. It has a lot of best practices for speeding up your web site.AFAIK, the browser (at least Firefox) requests every resource as soon as it parses it. If it encounters an img tag it will request that image as soon as the img tag has been parsed. And that can be even before it has received the totality of the HTML document... that is it could still be downloading the HTML document when that happens.For Firefox, there are browser queues that apply, depending on how they are set in about:config. For example it will not attempt to download more then 8 files at once from the same server... the additional requests will be queued. I think there are per-domain limits, per proxy limits, and other stuff, which are documented on the Mozilla website and can be set in about:config. I read somewhere that IE has no such limits.The jQuery ready event is fired as soon as the main HTML document has been downloaded and it's DOM parsed. Then the load event is fired once all linked resources (CSS, images, etc.) have been downloaded and parsed as well. It is made clear in the jQuery documentation.If you want to control the order in which all that is loaded, I believe the most reliable way to do it is through JavaScript.Dynatrace AJAX Edition shows you the exact sequence of page loading, parsing and execution.The chosen answer looks like does not apply to modern browsers, at least on Firefox 52. What I observed is that the requests of loading resources like css, javascript are issued before HTML parser reaches the element, for example 

What I found that the start time of requests to load css and javascript resources were not being blocked. Looks like Firefox has a HTML scan, and identify key resources(img resource is not included) before starting to parse the HTML.

I use nginx to as the front server, I have modified the CSS files, but nginx is still serving the old ones.I have tried to restart nginx, to no success and I have Googled, but not found a valid way to clear it.Some articles say we can just delete the cache directory: var/cache/nginx, but there is no such directory on my server.What should I do now?I had the exact same problem - I was running my nginx in Virtualbox. I did not have caching turned on. But looks like sendfile was set to on in nginx.conf and that was causing the problem. @kolbyjack mentioned it above in the comments.When I turned off sendfile - it worked fine.This is because:It is related to this bug: https://www.virtualbox.org/ticket/12597You can also bypass/re-cache on a file by file basis using and as a bonus you can return this header to see if you got it from the cache (will return 'HIT') or from the content server (will return 'BYPASS').to expire/refresh the cached file, use curl or any rest client to make a request to the cached page.this will return a fresh copy of the item and it will also replace what's in cache.Unless you configured a cache zone via proxy_cache_path and then used it (for example in a location block), via:

proxy_cache nothing will get cached.If you did, however, then according to the author of nginx, simply removing all files from the cache directory is enough.Simplest way: find /path/to/your/cache -type f -deleteYou can delete cache directory of nginx or You can search specific file:And delete only one file to nginx refresh them.There's two answers in this question.Use:E.G.: I found this usefulSearch, and if found then delete.In my nginx install I found I had to go to:andin that directory. If you know the path to your nginx install and can find the cache directory the same may work for you. Be very careful with the rm -rf command, if you are in the wrong directory you could delete your entire hard drive.I had this problem also. My domain uses cloudflare.com for DNS (great service!). Aha! There it was:cloudflare.com -> caching -> Purge Cache (I purged everything) 

That solved my problem!I run a very simple bash script which takes all of 10 seconds to do the job and sends me a mail when done.We have a very large nginx cache (gigabytes) that we occasionally need to wipe. I've worked out a script that instantly clears the cache (as far as Nginx is concerned) and then removes the cache directory without starving the main application for disk I/O.In summary:Here's the script, tailored to Ubuntu 16.04 LTS, with the cache located at /mnt/nginx-cache:And in case it's helpful, here's the Nginx config we use:For those who other solutions are not working, check if you're using a DNS service like CloudFlare. In that case activate the "Development Mode" or use the "Purge Cache" tool.Please take note that proxy_cache_bypass can give you a world of hurt if your app doesn't return a cacheable response for that specific request where you trigger it.If for example your app sends a cookie with every first request, then a script which triggers proxy_pass_bypass via curl will probably get that cookie in the answer, and nginx will not use that response to refresh the cached item.Be careful to properly specify the correct path.For those who have tried deleting the nginx cache files, and either it hasn't worked or has worked intermittently, have a look at your setting for open_file_cache. If this is enabled and configured to cache a file descriptor for a long time, then Nginx may still see a version of the cached file, even after you've deleted it from disk. I had to reduce open_file_cache_valid to 1s (I'm not certain if this is essentially the same as disabling the file cache completely).On my server, the nginx cache folder is at /data/nginx/cache/So I removed it only: sudo rm -rf /data/nginx/cache/Hope this will help anyone.If you want to clear the cache of specific files then you can use the proxy_cache_bypass directive. This is how you do itNow if you want bypass the cache you access the file by passing the nocache parameter http://www.example.com/app.css?nocache=trueYou can add configuration in nginx.conf like the following.From above, a folder named "nginx_cache" is dynamicly created in /tmp/ to store cached content.There is one right method to remove only cache-files, which matches any KEY. For example:This removes all cache-files, which matches to KEY "yahoo/*", if in nginx.conf was set:We use nginx for caching lots of stuff. There are tens of thousands of items in the cache directory. To find items and delete them, we have developed a some scripts to simplify this process. You can find the repository for this scripts below:https://github.com/zafergurel/nginx-cache-cleanerThe idea is simple. To create an index of the cache (with cache keys and corresponding cache files) and search within this index file. It really helped us to speed-up finding items (from minutes to sub-second) and delete them accordingly.In my case, touch that Css file, make it looks like resources changed (actually touch does nothing to the file, except change last modify time), so browser and nginx will apply latest resourcesI was experiencing a kind of similar issue:System setup and Problem:

(On a virtualbox I'm web hosting using ubuntu and nginx - PHP webpage refreshes did not reflect changes to external css file). I'm developing website on windows machine and transferring files to nginx via shared folder. It seems nginx does not pick up changes to css file (refreshing in any fashion does not help. Changing css file name is only thing that worked)Solution:

On VM find shared file (css file in my case). Open with nano and compare to file in windows share (they appear identical). On VM save shared file with nano. All changes are now reflected in browser. Not sure why this works but it did in my case.UPDATE: After rebooting the VM server the problem returned. Following the instructions under Solution made the css responsive to updates againIn my case it was the enabled opcache in /etc/php/7.2/fpm/php.ini (Ubuntu):Setting it to 0 made the server loading the latest version of the (php)files.

I need to develop some html pages for iphone/android phones, but what is the difference between max-device-width and max-width? I need to use different css for different screen size.What's the difference?max-width is the width of the target display area, e.g. the browsermax-device-width is the width of the device's entire rendering area, i.e. the actual device screenSame goes for max-height and max-device-height naturally.max-width refers to the width of the viewport and can be used to target specific sizes or orientations in conjunction with max-height. Using multiple max-width (or min-width) conditions you could change the page styling as the browser is resized or the orientation changes on a device like an iPhone.max-device-width refers to the viewport size of the device regardless of orientation, current scale or resizing. This will not change on a device so cannot be used to switch style sheets or CSS directives as the screen is rotated or resized.What do you think about using this style?For all breakpoints which are mostly for "mobile device" I use min(max)-device-width and for breakpoints which are mostly for "desktop" use min(max)-width. There are a lot of "mobile devices" that badly calculate width.Look at http://www.javascriptkit.com/dhtmltutors/cssmediaqueries2.shtml:max-device-width is the device rendering widthThe max-width is the width of the target display area means the current size of browser.the difference is that max-device-width is all screen's width and max-width means the space used by the browser to show the pages. But another important difference is the support of android browsers, in fact if u're going to use max-device-width this will work only in Opera, instead I'm sure that max-width will work for every kind of mobile browser (I had test it in Chrome, firefox and opera for ANDROID).max-width is the width of the target display area, e.g. the browser; max-device-width is the width of the device's entire rendering area, i.e. the actual device screen.•   If you are using the max-device-width, when you change the size of the browser window on your desktop, the CSS style won't change to different media query setting;•   If you are using the max-width, when you change the size of the browser on your desktop, the CSS will change to different media query setting and you might be shown with the styling for mobiles, such as touch-friendly menus.If you are making a cross-platform app (eg. using phonegap/cordova) then,Don't use device-width or device-height. Rather use width or height in CSS media queries because Android device will give problems in device-width or device-height. For iOS it works fine. Only android devices doesn't support device-width/device-height.Don't use device-width/height anymore. device-width, device-height and device-aspect-ratio are deprecated in Media Queries Level 4: 

https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@media#Media_featuresJust use width/height (without min/max) in combination with orientation & (min/max-)resolution to target specific devices. On mobile width/height should be the same as device-width/height.

Just wondering if it's possible somehow to make the CSS content property insert html code instead string on :before or :after an element like:this would be quite handy...It could be done through Javascript but using css for this would really make lives easier :)Unfortunately, this is not possible. Per the spec:In other words, for string values this means the value is always treated literally. It is never interpreted as markup, regardless of the document language in use.As an example, using the given CSS with the following HTML:... will result in the following output:As almost noted in comments to @BoltClock's answer, in modern browsers, you can actually add some html markup to pseudo-elements using the  (url()) in combination with svg's <foreignObject> element.You can either specify an URL pointing to an actual svg file, or create it with a dataURI version (data:image/svg+xml; charset=utf8, + encodeURIComponent(yourSvgMarkup))But note that it is mostly a hack and that there are a lot of limitations : Now, a small demo of some html markup in a pseudo element : In CSS3 paged media this is possible using position: running() and content: element().Example from the CSS Generated Content for Paged Media Module draft:.runner can be any element and heading is an arbitrary name for the slot.EDIT: to clarify, there is basically no browser support so this was mostly meant to be for future reference/in addition to the 'practical answers' given already.

I find that when I position an element fixed, it doesn't matter if the parent is positioned relative or not, it will position fixed, relative to the window?CSSHTMLhttp://jsbin.com/ibesa3Let me provide answers to both possible questions. Note that your existing title (and original post) ask a question different than what you seek in your edit and subsequent comment.To position an element "fixed" relative to a parent element, you want position:absolute on the child element, and any position mode other than the default or static on your parent element.For example:This will position childDiv element 50 pixels left and 20 pixels down relative to parentDiv's position.To position an element "fixed" relative to the window, you want position:fixed, and can use top:, left:, right:, and bottom: to position as you see fit. For example:This will position yourDiv fixed relative to the web browser window, 40 pixels from the bottom edge and 40 pixels from the right edge.The CSS specification requires that position:fixed be anchored to the viewport, not the containing positioned element.If you must specify your coordinates relative to a parent, you will have to use JavaScript to find the parent's position relative to the viewport first, then set the child (fixed) element's position accordingly.ALTERNATIVE: Some browsers have sticky CSS support which limits an element to be positioned within both its container and the viewport. Per the commit message:Depending on your design goals, this behavior may be helpful in some cases. It is currently a working draft, and has decent support, aside from table elements. position: sticky still needs a -webkit prefix in Safari.See caniuse for up-to-date stats on browser support.first, set position: fixed and  left: 50%, and second — now your start is a center and you can set new position with margin.It's now possible in modern browsers to position an element fixed relative to its container. An element that has a transform property acts as the viewport for any of its fixed position child elements.Or as the CSS Transforms Module puts it:I know this is super old but after not finding the (pure CSS) answer I was looking for I came up with this solution (partially abstracted from medium.com) and thought it might help others looking to do the same thing. If you combine @DuckMaestro's answers you can position an element fixed relative to a parent (actually grandparent). Use position: absolute; to position an element inside a parent with position: relative; and then position: fixed; on an element inside the absolute positioned element like so:EXAMPLELike @JonAdams said, the definition of position: fixed requires the element to be positioned relative to the viewport but you can get around the horizontal aspect of that using this solution. Note: This is different than just setting a right or left value on the fixed element because that would cause it to move horizontally when a window is resized. Here is an example of Jon Adams suggestion above in order to fix a div (toolbar) to the right hand side of your page element using jQuery. The idea is to find the distance from the right hand side of the viewport to the right hand side of the page element and to keep the right hand side of the toolbar there!  It's an old post but i'll leave here my javascript solution just in case someone need it.Notes This solution works for me! Reference to the original detailed answer: https://stackoverflow.com/a/11833892/5385623css:html:I know this is an older post, but I think a good example of what Jiew Meng was trying to do can already be found on this site.  Check out the side menu located here: https://stackoverflow.com/faq#questions.  Looking at it without getting into it too deep, I can tell javascript attaches a fixed position once the scrolling hits below the anchor tag and removes the fixed positioning if the scrolling goes above that same anchor tag.  Hopefully, that will get someone started in the right direction.With multiple divs I managed to get a fixed-y and absolute-x divs.

In my case I needed a div on left and right sides, aligned to a centered 1180px width div.

I was trying to avoid both those things but they sound like they'll be more compatible than trying to do stuff purely with CSS.  The answer to my original question seems to be "you can sort of do it, sometimes".Adjusting the background-size is permitted. You still need to specify width and height of the block, however.See the full Compatibility Table at the MDN.Note that the :after pseudo-element is a box, which in turn contains the generated image. There is no way to style the image, but you can style the box.The following is just an idea, and the solution above is more practical. http://jsfiddle.net/Nwupm/Drawbacks: you need to know the intrinsic dimensions of the image, and it leaves you with some whitespace, which I can't get rid of ATM.Since my other answer was obviously not well understood, here's a second attempt:There's two approaches to answer the question.Forget about the :after pseudo-selector, and go for something likeThe question is: Can you style generated content? The answer is: No, you can't. There's been a lengthy discussion on the W3C mailing list on this issue, but no solution so far.Generated content is rendered into a generated box, and you can style that box, but not the content as such. Different browsers show very different behaviour(from http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-style/2011Nov/0451.html )Similarly, browsers show very different results on things like http://jsfiddle.net/Nwupm/1/ , where more than one element is generated. Keep in mind that CSS3 is still in early development stage, and this issue has yet to be solved.You should use background instead of image.Here is another (working) solution : just resize your images to the size you want :)you need pdf.png to be 20px * 10px for this to work.

The 20px/10px in the css are here to give the size of the block so that the elements that come after the block are not all messed up with the imageDon't forget to keep a copy of the raw image in its original size diplay: block; have no any effectpositionin also works very strange accodringly to frontend foundamentals, so be carefulYou can use the zoom property. Check this jsfiddleYou can change the height or width of the Before or After element like this:I used this font size control widthNowadays with flexbox you can greatly simplify your code and only adjust 1 parameter as needed:Now you can just adjust the width of the element and the height will automatically adjust, increase/decrease the width until the height of the element is at the number you need.

HTML table with fixed headers?

Is there a cross-browser CSS/JavaScript technique to display a long HTML table such that the column headers stay fixed on-screen and do not scroll with the table body. Think of the "freeze panes" effect in Microsoft Excel.I want to be able to scroll through the contents of the table, but to always be able to see the column headers at the top.I was looking for a solution for this for a while and found most of the answers are not working or not suitable for my situation, so I wrote a simple solution with jQuery.This is the solution outline:Below is the code in a runnable demo.This solution works in Chrome and IE. Since it is based on jQuery, this should work in other jQuery supported browsers as well.If you only care about modern browsers, a fixed header can be achieved much easier by using CSS transforms. Sounds odd, but works great:Support for CSS transforms is widely available except for Internet Explorer 8-.Here is the full example for reference:I've just completed putting together a jQuery plugin that will take valid single table using valid HTML (have to have a thead and tbody) and will output a table that has fixed headers, optional fixed footer that can either be a cloned header or any content you chose (pagination, etc.).  If you want to take advantage of larger monitors it will also resize the table when the browser is resized.  Another added feature is being able to side scroll if the table columns can not all fit in view.http://fixedheadertable.com/on github: http://markmalek.github.com/Fixed-Header-Table/It's extremely easy to setup and you can create your own custom styles for it.  It also uses rounded corners in all browsers.  Keep in mind I just released it, so it's still technically beta and there are very few minor issues I'm ironing out.It works in Internet Explorer 7, Internet Explorer 8, Safari, Firefox and Chrome.I also created a plugin that addresses this issue. My project - jQuery.floatThead has been around for over 4 years now and is very mature.It requires no external styles and does not expect your table to be styled in any particular way. It supports Internet Explorer9+ and Firefox/Chrome.Currently (2018-05) it has:Many (not all) of the answers here are quick hacks that may have solved the problem one person was having, but will work not for every table.Some of the other plugins are old and probably work great with Internet Explorer, but will break on Firefox and Chrome.If you target modern browsers and don't have extravagant styling needs: http://jsfiddle.net/dPixie/byB9d/3/ ... Although the big four version is pretty sweet as well this version handles fluid width a lot better.With the advances of HTML5 and CSS3 this is now possible, at least for modern browsers. The slightly hackish implementation I came up with can be found here: http://jsfiddle.net/dPixie/byB9d/3/. I have tested it in FX 25, Chrome 31 and IE 10 ...Relevant HTML (insert a HTML5 doctype at the top of your document though):Simply put you have a table header, that you visually hide by making it 0px high, that also contains divs used as the fixed header. The table's container leaves enough room at the top to allow for the absolutely positioned header, and the table with scrollbars appear as you would expect.The code above uses the positioned class to position the table absolutely (I'm using it in a popup style dialog) but you can use it in the flow of the document as well by removing the positioned class from the container.It's not perfect. Firefox refuses to make the header row 0px (at least I did not find any way) but stubbornly keeps it at minimum 4px ... It's not a huge problem, but depending on your styling it will mess with your borders etc.The table is also using a faux column approach where the background color of the container itself is used as the background for the header divs, that are transparent.All in all there might be styling issues depending on your requirements, especially borders or complicated backgrounds. There might also be problems with computability, I haven't checked it in a wide variety of browsers yet (please comment with your experiences if you try it out), but I didn't find anything like it so I thought it was worth posting anyway ...All of the attempts to solve this from outside the CSS specification are pale shadows of what we really want: Delivery on the implied promise of THEAD.This frozen-headers-for-a-table issue has been an open wound in HTML/CSS for a long time.In a perfect world, there would be a pure-CSS solution for this problem. Unfortunately, there doesn't seem to be a good one in place.Relevant standards-discussions on this topic include:UPDATE: Firefox shipped position:sticky in version 32. Everyone wins!Here is a jQuery plugin for fixed table headers. It allows the entire page to scroll, freezing the header when it reaches the top. It works well with Twitter Bootstrap tables.GitHub repository: https://github.com/oma/table-fixed-headerIt does not scroll only table content. Look to other tools for that, as one of these other answers. You decide what fits your case the best.Most of the solutions posted here require jQuery. If you are looking for a framework independent solution try Grid: http://www.matts411.com/post/grid/It's hosted on Github here: https://github.com/mmurph211/GridNot only does it support fixed headers, it also supports fixed left columns and footers, among other things.The CSS property position: sticky has great support in most modern browsers (I had issues with Edge, see below).This lets us solve the problem of fixed headers quite easily:Safari needs a vendor prefix: -webkit-sticky.For Firefox, I had to add min-height: 0 to one the parent elements. I forget exactly why this was needed.Most unfortunately, the Microsoft Edge implementation seems to be only semi-working. At least, I had some flickering and misaligned table cells in my testing. The table was still usable, but had significant aesthetic issues.All of the pure CSS solutions I've seen so far-- clever though they may be-- lack a certain level of polish, or just don't work right in some situations. So, I decided to create my own...Features:Here are a couple of fiddles that show the fluid and auto width options:The Auto Width, Fixed Height configuration probably has more use cases, so I'll post the code below.The method I used to freeze the header row is similar to d-Pixie's, so refer to his post for an explanation. There were a slew of bugs and limitations with that technique that could only be fixed with heaps of additional CSS and an extra div container or two.This is a variation on Mahes' solution. You can call it like $('table#foo').scrollableTable();The idea is:The CSS could be:That said, it works for my purposes and you're free to take and modify it.Here's the plugin::) Not-so-clean, but pure HTML/CSS solution.Updated for IE8+

JSFiddle exampleI extended Nathan's function to also support a fixed footer and maximum height.

Also, the function will set the CSS itself, and you only have to support a width.Usage:Fixed height:Maximum height (if the browser supports the CSS 'max-height' option):Script:Two divs, one for header, one for data.  Make the data div scrollable, and use JavaScript to set the width of the columns in the header to be the same as the widths in the data.  I think the data columns widths need to be fixed rather than dynamic.Somehow I ended up with Position:Sticky working fine on my case:I realize the question allows JavaScript, but here is a pure CSS solution I worked up that also allows for the table to expand horizontally. It was tested with Internet Explorer 10 and the latest Chrome and Firefox browsers. A link to jsFiddle is at the bottom.The HTML:And the CSS:http://jsfiddle.net/HNHRv/3/For those who tried the nice solution given by Maximilian Hils, and did not succeed to get it to work with Internet Explorer, I had the same problem (Internet Explorer 11) and found out what was the problem.In Internet Explorer 11 the style transform (at least with translate) does not work on <THEAD>. I solved this by instead applying the style to all the <TH> in a loop. That worked. My JavaScript code looks like this:In my case the table was a GridView in ASP.NET. First I thought it was because it had no <THEAD>, but even when I forced it to have one, it did not work. Then I found out what I wrote above.It is a very nice and simple solution. On Chrome it is perfect, on Firefox a bit jerky, and on Internet Explorer even more jerky. But all in all a good solution.I wish I had found @Mark's solution earlier, but I went and wrote my own before I saw this SO question...Mine is a very lightweight jQuery plugin that supports fixed header, footer, column spanning (colspan), resizing, horizontal scrolling, and an optional number of rows to display before scrolling starts.jQuery.scrollTableBody (GitHub)As long as you have a table with proper <thead>, <tbody>, and (optional) <tfoot>, all you need to do is this:I found this workaround - move header row in a table above table with data:By applying the StickyTableHeaders jQuery plugin to the table, the column headers will stick to the top of the viewport as you scroll down. Example:I like Maximillian Hils' answer but I had a some issues:To get rid of the flicker, I use a timeout to wait until the user has finished scrolling, then I apply the transform - so the header is not visible during scrolling. I have also written this using jQuery, one advantage of that being that jQuery should handle vendor-prefixes for youThe table is wrapped in a div with the class table-container-fixed.I set border-collapse to separate because otherwise we lose borders during translation, and I remove the border on the table to stop content appearing just above the cell where the border was during scrolling.I make the th background white to cover the cells underneath, and I add a border that matches the table border - which is styled using Bootstrap and scrolled out of view.Use the latest version of jQuery, and include the following JavaScript code.This is not an exact solution to the fixed header row, but I have created a rather ingenious method of repeating the header row throughout the long table, yet still keeping the ability to sort.This neat little option requires the jQuery tablesorter plugin. Here's how it works:HTMLObviously, my table has many more rows than this. 193 to be exact, but you can see where the header row repeats. The repeating header row is set up by this function:jQueryA lot of people seem to be looking for this answer. I found it buried in an answer to another question here: Syncing column width of between tables in two different frames, etcOf the dozens of methods I have tried this is the only method I found that works reliably to allow you to have a scrolling bottom table with the header table having the same widths.Here is how I did it, first I improved upon the jsfiddle above to create this function, which works on both td and th (in case that trips up others who use th for styling of their header rows).Next, you need to create two tables, NOTE the header table should have an extra TD to leave room in the top table for the scrollbar, like this:Then do something like:This is the only solution that I found on Stack Overflow that works out of many similar questions that have been posted, that works in all my cases.For example, I tried the jQuery stickytables plugin which does not work with durandal, and the Google Code project here https://code.google.com/p/js-scroll-table-header/issues/detail?id=2Other solutions involving cloning the tables, have poor performance, or suck and don't work in all cases.There is no need for these overly complex solutions. Just make two tables like the examples below and call setHeaderTableWidth function like described here and boom, you are done.If this does not work for you, you probably were playing with your CSS box-sizing property and you need to set it correctly. It is easy to screw up your CSS content by accident. There are many things that can go wrong, so just be aware/careful of that. This approach works for me.Here's a solution that we ended up working with (in order to deal with some edge cases and older versions of Internet Explorer, we eventually also faded out the title bar on scroll then faded it back in when scrolling ends, but in Firefox and WebKit browsers this solution just works. It assumes border-collapse: collapse.The key to this solution is that once you apply border-collapse, CSS transforms work on the header, so it's just a matter of intercepting scroll events and setting the transform correctly. You don't need to duplicate anything. Short of this behavior being implemented properly in the browser, it's hard to imagine a more light-weight solution.JSFiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/podperson/tH9VU/2/It's implemented as a simple jQuery plugin. You simply make your thead's sticky with a call like $('thead').sticky(), and they'll hang around. It works for multiple tables on a page and head sections halfway down big tables.Here is an improved answer to the one posted by Maximilian Hils.This one works in Internet Explorer 11 with no flickering whatsoever:I developed a simple light-weight jQuery plug-in for converting a well formatted HTML table to a scrollable table with fixed table header and columns.The plugin works well to match pixel-to-pixel positioning the fixed section with the scrollable section. Additionally, you could also freeze the number of columns that will be always in view when scrolling horizontally.

I set the element size to 21cm x 29.7cm, but when I send to print (or print preview) it clip my page.See this Live example!I think I'm forgetting something. But what would it be?I looked into this a bit more and the actual problem seems to be with assigning initial to page width under the print media rule. It seems like in Chrome width: initial on the .page element results in scaling of the page content if no specific length value is defined for width on any of the parent elements (width: initial in this case resolves to width: auto ... but actually any value smaller than the size defined under the @page rule causes the same issue).So not only the content is now too long for the page (by about 2cm), but also the page padding will be slightly more than the initial 2cm and so on (it seems to render the contents under width: auto to the width of ~196mm and then scale the whole content up to the width of 210mm ~ but strangely exactly the same scaling factor is applied to contents with any width smaller than 210mm).To fix this problem you can simply in the print media rule assign the A4 paper width and hight to html, body or directly to .page and in this case avoid the initial keyword.This seems to keep everything else the way it is in your original CSS and fix the problem in Chrome (tested in different versions of Chrome under Windows, OS X and Ubuntu).CSSHTMLDEMOhttps://github.com/cognitom/paper-css seems to solve all my needs.

To make bootstrap 3.0.2 responsive in IE8 (emulated using the F12 Developer Tools) I had to:1 - Set the X-UA-Compatible flag.2 - Use the non-minified bootstrap.css, instead of bootstrap.min.css3 - Add the respond.js (and html5shiv.js)put respond.js at bottom of page but before closing body tag and here is link of respond.js and run this code in your localhost.https://github.com/scottjehl/RespondJust in case.  Make sure you load the IE specific js files after you load your css files.Don't forget to place your css links in the <head> as respond.js takes only those.As previously stated there are two different problems: 

1) IE8 doesn't support media queries

2) respond.js used in conjunction with cross-domain css files must be included as described before.If you want to use BootstrapCDN here's a working example:Also make sure to copy respond.proxy.gif, respond.min.js and response.proxy.js in local directoriesAfter verifying:Still col-lg, col-md, and col-sm were not working.  Finally I moved the references to bootstrap to be before the references to html5shiv.js and respond.js and it all worked.Here is a snippet:From the explanation it says that IE8 is the standard version for you and making content="IE=edge" will render the page in the highest mode. To make it compatible change it to content="IE=8".Reference What does <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge"> do?Needed to add - <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge">I was using Bootstrap 3 - had it working on IE on my local. I put it live didn't work in IE.Just Bootstrap doesn't include that line of code in their templates, I'm not sure why but it might be due to it not being W3C compatible.I have a  fix for this issue. Actually IE7 and 8 doesnt support the @media properly and if you check the css for「col-md-*」classes and there width is given in media width 992px. Just create a new css file IE eg: IE.css and add in the conditional comments. And then just copy the classes required for your design directly with any media queries there and you are done.I had exactly the same problem when migrating from bootstrapv2 to v3.If (like me) you migrated by replacing the old spanX with col-sm-X you also need to add col-X classes. col-X are the styles that are outside of any @media blocks so they work without media query support.To fix the container width you can set it yourself outside of a @media block. Something like:I've suffer the same problem in IE 10.0. I know this is not exactly the problem in the OP, but maybe it will be usefull for others.In my case, I had an empty line at the beginning of the document:If the blank line is between the DOCTYPE and the  tag, the problem is also shown:Once I've removed the blank line, and without the magic X-UA-Compatible meta, IE 10 has started to render the site correctly.If you are using PHP and Smarty be careful with your Smarty comments because they will add those problematic blank lines :-)my head tag is like this:if you want to try in local...try through localhost, or create a QA server and set the content and try. We need respond.js for bootstrap 3 and it wont work in local machine if we just put it in js and append it to html in header. It will say access denied. it works only through server as IE has security restriction. :PI've read every comment here, tried everything.. but couldn't get it to work with Windows 7 - Internet Explorer 11 (with document mode: IE8).Then it came to mind that running a document mode (IE8) isn't the same as the real IE8, so I installed Windows Virtual PC (Windows 7 with Internet Explorer 8) and tadaaaa... it works like a charm!I've put this piece of code JUST at the bottom of the page to make it work:Just as a heads up. I had the same problem and none of the above fixed it for me. Eventually I found out that respond.js doesn't parse CSS referenced via @import. I had the whole bootstrap.min.css imported via @import into my main.css.So make sure you don't have any CSS that contains your media queries referenced via @import.I have resolved below steps.(1) installed Respond.js module for drupal 7.

(2) lessphp module for drupal 7 set in libraries, instead of module folder.

(3) 

(3.1)<meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge">(3.2)using cdn bootstrap from theme setting.To learn more, review my website blog for drupal design and development www.devangsolanki.comIf you use Bootstrap 3 and everything works fine on other browsers except IE, try the below.Use this solution This string <script src="js/css3-mediaqueries.js"></script> enable mediaqueries.

This string <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="css/bootstrap-ie7.css" /> enable bootstrap fonts.Tested on Bootstrap 3.3.5Link to download  mediaqieries.js.

Link to download  bootstrap-ie7.cssIf you use LESS or SASS don't be to greedy with compiling the styles.

In my project I included bootstrap.min.css in my  main style, on the top of the file - so there should be only one request for all styles.And because of that, the boostrap classes did not work properly.

When added separately, works as expected.I faced the same problem, tried the first answer but something was missing.If you guys are using Webpack, your css will be loaded as a style tag which is not supported by respond.js, it needs a file, so make sure bootstrap is loaded as a css filePersonally I used extract-text-webpack-plugin Hope it will help you

Is there anything in HTML/CSS that tells the browser to ignore whitespace completely?So many times when you want to put, say, two images next to each other - you try desperately to keep the HTML readable, but the browser puts a space between them.So instead of something like this:you end up with thisWhich is just so horrible!Oh, you can really easy accomplish that with a single line of CSS:Disadvantage, you ask? No browser has implemented this extremely useful feature (think of inline blocks in general) yet. :-(What I did from time to time, although it's ugly as the night is dark, is to use comments:you can set the font-size of the container to 0 and the white-space disappears!The browsers does ignore whitespace in most cases when it's next to a block element.The problem with images (in this case) is that they are inline elements, so while you write them on separate lines, they are actually elements on the same line with a space between them (as the line break counts as a space). It would be incorrect for the browser to remove the spaces between the images, writing the image tags with line breaks between them should be handled the same way as writing the image tags on the same line with spaces between them.You can use CSS to make the images block elements and float them next to each other, that solves a lot of problems with spacing, both the space between the images and the spacing on the text line below images.Unfortunately, newlines count as space characters.The best solution I have come up with is to use the whitespace inside the tags themselves, instead of outside:It's not ideal, either, I know. But at least it's not some bizarre CSS hack that relies on the size a space character is rendered or resorting to relative positioning, or JavaScript :)The newest solution for this is using display: flex on outside container, you can try this with following example:Codepen →(And yes, Flexbox is becoming widely supported: http://caniuse.com/#search=flexbox)HTML:CSS

Update: Also, if you want your items to wrap (as standard inline-block elements do), don't forget to add flex-wrap: wrap to your flexbox container.OK, I might be lucky in that I only have to worry right now about getting this to work in webkit (specifically the one embedded in QT) so it works in Chrome and Safari too. Seems display: table-cell has all the benefits of display: inline-block, but without the whitespace drawback (think indented td's)What was so difficult about this solution?Images are per default inline elements, that’s why you see whitespace between them. If you listen to your example in a screen reader, you immediately know why: without whitespace, you’d hear: So, use my mini thing. (dot plus whitespace at the end) as alt text or push the images with CSS together. Do not just remove the whitespace in the code.If you're using php, this works wonderfully. I found the solution here.I was originally looking for something to remove text nodes consisting of only whitespace after parsing html with something like simplexml, but this is much cheaper.This is a simple question and the answer is not so simple.One can try to avoid the spaces in the source code which is not always achievable in CMS, because there they are automatically inserted by the system. If you want to change this you have to dig deep inte the CMS's core code.Then you can try to use left floated images. But this is dangerous. At first you don't really have a control over vertical-alignment by definition. And secondly, you run into total chaos if you have so many floated elements, that they stretch over more than one line. And if you have a layout that relies on left floated elements (most of them do so today) you can even break some outer floating styles, if you clear floating after the images. This can be overridden, if you float any surrounding element. Rather not to be recommended.So the only solution would be a CSS declaration that handles the process of whitespace handling. This is not part of any standard (as CSS 3 is not yet finished).I prefer the no whitespace in HTML variant. With using drupal as CMS this can be achieved rather easy in your template.php and theming files. Then I choose inline-block.P.S.:

inline-block is rather complicated to get in the different browsers.

For FF 2 you need display: -moz-inline-box.

The rest and IE8 can have display: inline-block right after.

And for lte IE 7 you need display: inline in a following separate declaration (preferrably via conditional comments).editWhat I use for making a element inline-blockTry this CSS:Minify your HTML!It is good practice to minify the response before it is rendered to the browser.So unless you need the space (and you hard coded it using &nbsp;), you always remove the spaces in the minification process.

Plus I'm not sure if this is considered JavaScript, CSS, or just plain HTML.It's css.Or in a style sheet:You can do this in CSS:This is actually the default behavior for links.

Baffling why this was done.There may be nothing wrong with the inquirer's link.  consider the following html:When a user mouse's over this link, the pointer will not change to a hand...instead, the pointer will behave like it's hovering over normal text.

as mentioned in answer marked as the best

is not suitable for this situation.The example in this topic does not have normal static href attribute,

it is calling of JS only, so it will not do anything without JS.So it is good to switch on pointer with JS only.

So, solutionas mentioned above (but I can not comment there) is the best one in this case. 

(But yes, generaly, for normal links not demanding JS, it is better to work with pure CSS without JS.)

However, using the right mix of parameters with the function should help. eg. stop(true,true) or stop(true,false) as this affects the queued animations well.The following link illustrates a demo that shows the different parameters available with stop() and how they differ from finish().http://api.jquery.com/finish/ Although the OP had no issues using JqueryUI, this is for other users who may come across similar scenarios but cannot use JqueryUI/need to support IE7 and 8 too.

Is it possible to use CSS/CSS3 to mirror text?Specifically, I have this scissors char「✂」(&#9986;) that I'd like to display pointing left and not right.You can use CSS transformations to achieve this. A horizontal flip would involve scaling the div like this:And a vertical flip would involve scaling the div like this:The two parameters are X axis, and Y axis, -1 will be a mirror, but you can scale to any size you like to suit your needs. Upside down and backwards would be (-1, -1).If you're interested in the best option available for cross browser support back in 2011, see my older answer.Real mirror:    You can user either or Notice that setting position to absolute is very important! If you won't set it, you will need to set     display: inline-block;I cobbled together this solution by scouring the Internet including This solution seems to work in all browsers including IE6+, using scale(-1,1) (a proper mirror) and appropriate filter/-ms-filter properties when necessary (IE6-8):For cross browser compatibility create this classAnd add it to your icon class, i.e.to get a search icon with the handle on the leftyou can use 'transform' to achieve this. 

http://jsfiddle.net/aRcQ8/css:There's also the rotateY for a real mirror one:Which, perhaps, is even more clear and understandable.EDIT: Doesn't seem to work on Opera though… sadly. But it works fine on Firefox. I guess it might required to implicitly say that we are doing some kind of translate3d perhaps? Or something like that.Just adding a working demo for horizontal and vertical mirror flip.this is what worked for me for <span class="navigation-pipe">&gt;</span>just need display:inline-block or block to rotate. So basically first answer is good. But -180 didn't worked.You could try box-reflectsee CSS property box-reflect compatibility? for more detailsJust one more example how the character could be flipped. Add vendor prefixes if you need ones but for now all modern browsers support unprefixed transform property.

So, in attempting to make a useful modal using flexbox, I found what seems to be a browser issue and am wondering if there is a known fix or workaround -- or ideas on how to resolve it.The thing I'm trying to solve, has two aspects. First, getting the modal window vertically centered, which works as expected. The second is to get the modal window to scroll -- externally, so the whole modal window scrolls, not the contents within it (this is so you can have dropdowns and other UI elements that can extend outside of the bounds of the modal -- like a custom date picker, etc.)However, when combining the vertical centering with scroll bars, the top of the modal can become inaccessible as it begins to overflow. In the above example, you can resize to force the overflow, and in doing so it allows you to scroll to the bottom of the modal, but not to the top (first paragraph is cut off).Here's the link to the example code (highly simplified)https://jsfiddle.net/dh9k18k0/2/This effects (current) Firefox, Safari, Chrome, and Opera..

Links to known issues, or reasoning behind this behavior would also be useful.Flexbox makes centering very easy.By simply applying align-items: center and justify-content: center to the flex container, your flex item(s) will be vertically and horizontally centered.However, there is a problem with this method when the flex item is bigger than the flex container.As noted in the question, when the flex item overflows the container the top becomes inaccessible.For horizontal overflow, the left section becomes inaccessible (or right section, in RTL languages).Here's an example with an LTR container having justify-content: center and three flex items:See the bottom of this answer for an explanation of this behavior.To fix this problem use flexbox auto margins, instead of justify-content.With auto margins, an overflowing flex item can be vertically and horizontally centered without losing access to any part of it.So instead of this code on the flex container:Use this code on the flex item:Revised DemoAdd the safe value to your keyword alignment rule, like this:orFrom the CSS Box Alignment Module specification:Note: The Box Alignment Module is for use across multiple box layout models, not just flex. So in the spec excerpt above, the terms in brackets actually say "alignment subject", "alignment container" and "start".  I used flex-specific terms to keep the focus on this particular problem.Well, as Murphy's Law would have it, the reading I did after posting this question resulted in a few results -- not completely resolved, but somewhat useful nonetheless.I played around with min-height a bit before posting, but was not aware of the intrinsic sizing constraints that are fairly new to the spec.http://caniuse.com/#feat=intrinsic-widthAdding a min-height: min-content to the flexbox area does resolve the issue in Chrome, and with vendor prefixes also fixes Opera and Safari, though Firefox remains unresolved.Still looking for ideas on Firefox, and other potential solutions.I managed to pull this off with just 3 containers. The trick is to separate the flexbox container from the container that controls the scrolling. Lastly, put everything into a root container to center it all. Here are the essential styles to create the effect:CSS:HTML:I've created a demo here: https://jsfiddle.net/r5jxtgba/14/I think I found a solution. It works with lots of text and a little text.

It's described as follows:So, it might be used as follows.However, it's unclear how much browser support it has, I could not find any examples of its use, and I have been having some issues with it myself.

I want to put two <div>s next to each other. The right <div> is about 200px; and the left <div> must fill up the rest of the screen width? How can I do this?You can use flexbox to lay out your items:This is basically just scraping the surface of flexbox. Flexbox can do pretty amazing things.For older browser support, you can use CSS float and a width properties to solve it.I don't know if this is still a current issue or not but I just encountered the same problem and used the CSS display: inline-block; tag.

Wrapping these in a div so that they can be positioned appropriately. Note that the use of the inline style attribute was only used for the succinctness of this example of course these used be moved to an external CSS file.Unfortunately, this is not a trivial thing to solve for the general case. The easiest thing would be to add a css-style property "float: right;" to your 200px div, however, this would also cause your "main"-div to actually be full width and any text in there would float around the edge of the 200px-div, which often looks weird, depending on the content (pretty much in all cases except if it's a floating image).EDIT:

As suggested by Dom, the wrapping problem could of course be solved with a margin. Silly me.The method suggested by @roe and @MohitNanda work, but if the right div is set as float:right;, then it must come first in the HTML source. This breaks the left-to-right read order, which could be confusing if the page is displayed with styles turned off. If that's the case, it might be better to use a wrapper div and absolute positioning:Demonstrated:Edit: Hmm, interesting. The preview window shows the correctly formatted divs, but the rendered post item does not. Sorry then, you'll have to try it for yourself.I ran into this problem today. Based on the solutions above, this worked for me:Simply make the parent div span the full width and float the divs contained within.UPDATEIf you need to place elements in a row, you can use Flex Layout. Here you have another Flex tutorial. It's a great CSS tool and even though it is not 100% compatible, each day its support is getting better. This works as simple as:HTMLCSSAnd what you get here is a container with a total size of 4 units, that share the space with its children in a relation of 1/4 and 3/4.I have done an example in CodePen that solves your problem. I hope it helps.http://codepen.io/timbergus/pen/aOoQLR?editors=110VERY OLDMaybe this is just a nonsense, but have you tried with a table? It not use directly CSS for positioning the divs, but it works fine.You can create a 1x2 table and put your divs inside, and then formatting the table with CSS to put them as you want:NoteIf you want to avoid using the table, as said before, you can use float: left; and float: right;and in the following element, don't forget to add a clear: left;, clear: right; or clear: both; in order to have the position cleaned.This will work OK as long as you set clear: both for the element that separates this two column block.I ran into the same problem and Mohits version works. If you want to keep your left-right order in the html, just try this. In my case, the left div is adjusting the size, the right div stays at width 260px.HTMLCSSThe trick is to use a right padding on the main box but use that space again by placing the right box again with margin-right.As everyone has pointed out, you'll do this by setting a float:right; on the RHS content and a negative margin on the LHS.However.. if you don't use a float: left; on the LHS (as Mohit does) then you'll get a stepping effect because the LHS div is still going to consume the margin'd space in layout.However.. the LHS float will shrink-wrap the content, so you'll need to insert a defined width childnode if that's not acceptable, at which point you may as well have defined the width on the parent.However.. as David points out you can change the read-order of the markup to avoid the LHS float requirement, but that's has readability and possibly accessibility issues.However.. this problem can be solved with floats given some additional markup(caveat: I don't approve of the .clearing div at that example, see here for details)All things considered, I think most of us wish there was a non-greedy width:remaining in CSS3...This won't be the answer for everyone, since it is not supported in IE7-, but you could use it and then use an alternate answer for IE7-. It is display: table, display: table-row and display: table-cell. Note that this is not using tables for layout, but styling divs so that things line up nicely with out all the hassle from above. Mine is an html5 app, so it works great.This article shows an example: http://www.sitepoint.com/table-based-layout-is-the-next-big-thing/Here is what your stylesheet will look like:I use a mixture of float and overflow-x:hidden. Minimal code, always works.https://jsfiddle.net/9934sc4d/4/ - PLUS you don't need to clear your float!To paraphrase one of my websites that does something similar:just use a z-index and everything will sit nice. make sure to have positions marked as fixed or absolute. then nothing will move around like with a float tag.

Is there a way to select an element in css based on element text?ie:That probably doesn't work.Edit: Also only need to support Chrome.Not with CSS directly, you could set CSS properties via JavaScript based on the internal contents but in the end you would still need to be operating in the definitions of CSS.I know it's not exactly what you are looking for, but maybe it'll help you.You can try use a jQuery selector :contains(), add a class and then do a normal style for a class.It was probably discussed, but as of CSS3 there is nothing like what you need (see also "Is there a CSS selector for elements containing certain text?").

Is there a way to drop the shadow only on the bottom?. I have a menu with 2 images next to each other. I don't want a right shadow because it overlaps the right image. I don't like to use images for this so is there a way to drop it only on the bottom like: box-shadow-bottom: 10px #FFF; or similar?Same like update 3 but with modern css (=less rules) so that no special positioning on the pseudo element is required.All my previous answers have been using extra markup to get create this effect, which is not necessarily needed. I think this a much cleaner solution... the only trick is playing around with the values to get the right positioning of the shadow as well as the right strength/opacity of the shadow. Here's a new fiddle, using pseudo-elements:http://jsfiddle.net/UnsungHero97/ARRRZ/2/HTMLCSSApparently, you can do this with just an extra parameter to the box-shadow CSS as everyone else just pointed out. Here's the demo:http://jsfiddle.net/K88H9/821/CSSThis would be a better solution. The extra parameter that is added is described as:Check out the demo at jsFiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/K88H9/4/What I did was create a "shadow element" that would hide behind the actual element that you would want to have a shadow. I made the width of the "shadow element" to be exactly less wide than the actual element by 2 times the shadow you specify; then I aligned it properly.HTMLCSSYes, you can do this with the same syntax you have provided. The first value controls the horizontal positioning and the second value controls the vertical positioning. So just set the first value to 0px and the second to whatever offset you'd like as follows:For more info on box shadows, check out these: I hope this helps.Just use the spread parameter to make the shadow smaller:Live demo: http://dabblet.com/gist/a8f8ba527f5cff607327To not see any shadow on the sides, the (absolute value of the) spread radius (4th parameter) needs to be the same as the blur radius (3rd parameter).If you have a fixed color on the background, you can hide the side-shadow effect with two masking shadows having the same color of the background and blur = 0, example:Note that the black shadow must be the last, and has a negative spread (-3px) in order to prevent it from extendig beyond the corners.Here the fiddle (change the color of the masking shadows to see how it really works).It's always better to read the specs. There is no box-shadow-bottom property, and as Lea points out you should always place the un-prefixed property at the bottom, after the prefixed ones.So it's:I think this is what you're after?How about just using a containing div which has overflow set to hidden and some padding at the bottom? This seems like much the simplest solution.Sorry to say I didn't think of this myself but saw it somewhere else.As said by Jorgen Evens.You could also use clip-path to clip (hide) all overflowing edges but the one you want to show:See clip-path (MDN). The arguments to polygon are the top-left point, the top-right point, the bottom-right point, and the bottom-left point. By setting the bottom edge to 200% (or whatever number bigger than 100%) you constrain your overflow to only the bottom edge.I also needed a shadow but only under an image and set in slightly left and right. This worked for me:The element this is applied to is a page-wide image (980px x 300px).If it helps when fiddling with the settings, they run as follows:horizontal shadow, vertical shadow, blur distance, spread (i.e. shadow size), and color.It is better to look up shadow: this code is currently using on stackoverflow web.This code pen (not by me) demonstrates a super simple way of doing this and the other sides by themselves quite nicely: https://codepen.io/zeckdude/pen/oxywmmIf your background is solid (or you can reproduce it using CSS), you can use linear gradient that way:This will generate a 5px gradient at the bottom of the element, from black at 30% opacity to completely transparent. The rest of the element has white background. Of course, changing the last 2 color stops of the linear gradient, you could make the background completely transparent.You could also just do a gradient on the bottom - this was helpful for me because the shadow I wanted was on an element that was already semi-transparent, so I didn't have to worry about any clipping:Just make the "bottom" and "height" properties match and set your rgba values to whatever you want them to be at the top / bottom of the shadowYou can do that like this:General syntax:Example: we want to make only a bottom box shadow with red color, so to do that we have to set all the sides options where we have to set the bottom box shadow options and set all the others as empty as follow:update on someone else his answer transparant sides instead of white so it works on other color backgrounds too.inner shadow

2015-04-19 16:29:11Z

Is there a way to make a line break in multiple line flexbox?For example to break after each 3rd item in this CodePen.LikeThe simplest and most reliable solution is inserting flex items at the right places. If they are wide enough (width: 100%), they will force a line break.But that's ugly and not semantic. Instead, we could generate pseudo-elements inside the flex container, and use order to move them to the right places.But there is a limitation: the flex container can only have a ::before and a ::after pseudo-element. That means you can only force 2 line breaks.To solve that, you can generate the pseudo-elements inside the flex items instead of in the flex container. This way you won't be limited to 2. But those pseudo-elements won't be flex items, so they won't be able to force line breaks.But luckily, CSS Display L3 has introduced display: contents (currently only supported by Firefox 37):So you can apply display: contents to the children of the flex container, and wrap the contents of each one inside an additional wrapper. Then, the flex items will be those additional wrappers and the pseudo-elements of the children.Alternatively, according to Fragmenting Flex Layout and CSS Fragmentation, Flexbox allows forced breaks by using break-before, break-after or their CSS 2.1 aliases:Forced line breaks in flexbox are not widely supported yet, but it works on Firefox.From my perspective it is more semantic to use <hr> elements as line breaks between flex items.Tested in Chrome 66, Firefox 60 and Safari 11.@Oriol has an excellent answer, sadly as of October 2017, neither display:contents, neither page-break-after is widely supported, better said it's about Firefox which supports this but not the other players, I have come up with the following "hack" which I consider better than hard coding in a break after every 3rd element, because that will make it very difficult to make the page mobile friendly. As said it's a hack and the drawback is that you need to add quite a lot of extra elements for nothing, but it does the trick and works cross browser even on the dated IE11.The "hack" is to simply add an additional element after each div, which is set to display:none and then used the css nth-child to decide which one of this should be actually made visible forcing a line brake like this:You want a semantic linebreak?Then consider using <br>. W3Schools may suggest you that BR is just for writing poems (mine is coming soon) but you can change the style so it behaves as a 100% width block element that will push your content to the next line. If 'br' suggests a break then it seems more appropriate to me than using hr or a 100% div and makes the html more readable.Insert the <br> where you need linebreaks and style it like this. You can disable <br> with media queries, by setting display: to block or none as appropriate (I've included an example of this but left it commented out).You can use order: to set the order if needed too.And you can put as many as you want, with different classes or names :-)No need to limit yourself to what W3Schools says:I think the traditional way is flexible and fairly easy to understand:MarkupCreate grid.css file:I've created an example (jsfiddle)Try to resize the window under 400px, it's responsive!!Another possible solution that doesn't require to add any extra markup is to add some dynamic margin to separate the elements.In the case of the example, this can be done with the help of calc(), just adding margin-left and margin-right to the 3n+2 element (2, 5, 8)Snippet ExampleFor future questions, It's also possible to do it by using float property and clearing it in each 3 elements.Here's an example I've made.I tried several answers here, and none of them worked. Ironically, what did work was about the simplest alternative to a <br/> one could attempt:<div style="flex-basis: 100%;"></div>or you could also do:<div style="width: 100%;"></div>Place that wherever you want a new line. It seems to work even with adjacent <span>'s, but I'm using it with adjacent <div>'s.you could try wrapping the items in a dom element like here. with this you dont have to know a lot of css just having a good structure will solve the problem.

To center elements on the normal navbar, try this:There's another way to do this for layouts that doesn't have to put the navbar inside the container, and which doesn't require any CSS or Bootstrap overrides.Simply place a div with the Bootstrap container class around the navbar.  This will center the links inside the navbar:If you want the then align body content to the center navbar, you also put that body content in the Bootstrap container tag.Not everyone can use this type of layout (some people need to nest the navbar itself inside the container).

If I have the following div:Is there a way to define a style that expresses the idea "A div with id='content' AND class='myClass'"?Or do you have simply go one way or the other as in OrIn your stylesheet:Edit: These might help, too:and, per your example:Edit, 4 years later: Since this is super old and people keep finding it: don't use the tagNames in your selectors. #content.myClass is faster than div#content.myClass because the tagName adds a filtering step that you don't need. Use tagNames in selectors only where you must!There are differences between #header .callout and #header.callout in css.Here is the "plain English" of #header .callout:

Select all elements with the class name callout that are descendants of the element with an ID of header.And #header.callout means:

Select the element which has an ID of header and also a class name of callout.You can read more here css tricksWell generally you shouldn't need to classify an element specified by id, because id is always unique, but if you really need to, the following should work:There's nothing wrong with combining an id and a class on one element, but you shouldn't need to identify it by both for one rule. If you really want to you can do:You don't need the div in front of the ID as others have suggested.In general, CSS rules specific to that element should be set with the ID, and those are going to carry a greater weight than those of just the class. Rules specified by the class would be properties that apply to multiple items that you don't want to change in multiple places anytime you need to adjust.That boils down to this:Make sense?You can combine ID and Class in CSS, but IDs are intended to be unique, so adding a class to a CSS selector would over-qualify it.use: tag.id ; tag#classin the tag variables in your css.Ids are supposed to be unique document wide, so you shouldn't have to select based on both.  You can assign an element multiple classes though with class="class1 class2"I think you are all wrong.  IDs versus Class is not a question of specificity; they have completely different logical uses.IDs should be used to identify specific parts of a page:  the header, the nav bar, the main article, author attribution, footer.Classes should be used to apply styles to the page.  Let's say you have a general magazine site.  Every page on the site is going to have the same elements--header, nav, main article, sidebar, footer.  But your magazine has different sections--economics, sports, entertainment.  You want the three sections to have different looks--economics conservative and square, sports action-y, entertainment bright and young.You use classes for that.  You don't want to have to make multiple IDs--#economics-article and #sports-article and #entertainment-article.  That doesn't make sense.  Rather, you would define three classes, .economics, sports, and .entertainment, then define the #nav, #article, and #footer ids for each.Won't work when the doctype is html 4.01 though...

If you're getting an error, chances are that you're not supplying the name.Alternatively, you can style the button without a class:Try that, as well.You can add a class declaration to the submit button of a form by doing the following: <%= f.submit class: 'btn btn-default' %> <-- Note: there is no comma!If you are altering a _form.html.erb partial of a scaffold and you want to keep

the dynamic change of the button name between controller actions, DO NOT specify a name 'name'.Without specifying a name and depending on the action the form is rendered the button will get the .class = "btn btn-default" (Bootstrap class)(or whatever .class you specify) with the following names: Yields something like:

So I'm trying to prototype a marketing page and I'm using Bootstrap and the new Font Awesome file. The problem is that when I try to use an icon, all that gets rendered on the page is a big square. Here's how I include the files in the head:And here's an example of me trying to use an icon:But all that gets rendered in a big square. Does anyone know what could be going on?According to the documentation (step 3), you need to modify the supplied CSS file to point to the font location on your site.You must have 2 classes, the fa class and the class that identifies the desired icon fa-twitter, fa-search, etc …Use this I had similar issue with Amazon Cloudfront CDN but it got resolved after I started loading it from maxcdnThis may help, check to ensure that you haven't inadvertently changed the font family on the icon. If you have changed the .fa item's font family from: FontAwesome the icon will not show. It's always something silly and small.Hope that helps someone.If you are using LESS or SASS, open the font-awesome.less/sass file and edit the path variable @fa-font-path: "../font"; which points to the actual fonts:Same with CSS, except you edit the path in the @font-face declaration block:Open your font-awesome.css

theres code like :you must have folder like :or the easiest way :I tried to solve the same problem with a few previous solutions, but they didn't work in my situation.

Finally, I added these 2 lines in HEAD and it worked:i am using Font Awesome 4.3.0 just linking from maxcdn works as mentioned here, but to host in your server putting fonts and css in same folder worked for me, like thisthen just link the css:hope helps someone.I had this issue. The problem was I had a font-family CSS style with !important overriding the fontawesome font.In case you are working with Maven and Apache Wicket also check for the following in order to try to resolve the issue with Font-Awesome and icons not being loaded:If you have placed your files for example in the following file structureCheck 1) Are you correctly using a Package Resource Guard in order to allow to load the font files correctly?Example from your class which extends WebApplication:Check 2) After you have made sure that all fonts are correctly transferred to the Web Browser, check for what has been actually transferred to the Web Browser, i.e., did the integrity of the font files change? Compare the files in your source directory and the files transferred to the Web Browser using, e.g., the Web Developer Toolbar of Firefox and DiffDog (for file comparison). In particular if you are using Maven be aware of resource filtering. Do not filter the folder where your /font files are contained - otherwise they will be corrupted.Example from your pom.xmlIn the example above we do not filter the folder src/main/java, where the css and font files are contained.For further information on the filtering of binary data please also see the documentation:http://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-resources-plugin/examples/filter.htmlIn particular the documentation warns: "Warning: Do not filter files with

binary content like images! This will most likely result in corrupt output.

If you have both text files and binary files as resources, you need to

declare two mutually exclusive resource sets. The first resource set

defines the files to be filtered and the other resource set defines the

files to copy unaltered..."You must have 2 classes, the fas class and the fa class, maybe this will work:I had this issue and went through each step carefully...even though I've been using FA for ages...and then I realized I had this line in my mail css file:Silly mistake, but this could tip off someone in future!This should be much simpler in the new version 3.0.

It just worked, when I corrected it.Here is the issue reference in their Github page, https://github.com/FortAwesome/Font-Awesome/issues/11946I hope it will help someone.If you are using the version 5.* or greater, then you have to use the Including the fontawesome.css does not work as it has no reference to the webfonts folder and there is no reference to the @font-face or font-familyYou can inspect this by searching the code for the font-family property in fontawesome.css or fontawesome.min.cssIt could be possible that your font path is not correct so that css not able to load the font and render the icons so you need to provide the stranded path of attached fonts.Use this <i class="fa fa-camera-retro" ></i> you have not defined fa classes Starting in version 5, if you downloaded the package from this site:https://fontawesome.com/downloadThe fonts are in the all.css and all.min.css file.This is what your reference would look like using the latest version now (replace with your folder):I have changed from 3.2.1 to 4.0.1 and the folder was font and now is called fonts.src: url('../font/fontawesome-webfont.eot?v=3.2.1');src: url('../fonts/fontawesome-webfont.eot?v=4.0.1');I hope it help someone.I use the Official Font Awesome SASS Ruby Gem and fixed the error by adding the below line to my application.css.scssExplanation:if your using sass and have imported in your main.scss

@import '../vendor/font-awesome/scss/font-awesome.scss';

The error may come from the font-awesome.scss file that is looking for the font files in it's relative path.So remember to override the $fa-font-path variable:

$fa-font-path:  "https://netdna.bootstrapcdn.com/font-awesome/4.3.0/fonts" !default;

like this there is no need to add the cdn in your index.htmlDouble check the fontawesome-all.css file - at the very bottom there will be a path to the webfonts folder. Mine had "../webfonts" format in it, which meant that the css file would be looking 1 level up from where it is. As all of my css files were in css folder and I added the fonts to the same folder, this was not working.Just move your fonts folder up a level and all should be well :)Tested with Font Awesome 5.0After struggling for finding a solution and NOT finding the official documentation helpful, this solved the issue for me:These names are mandatory. Now copy the content of css and webfonts from the zip into the corresponding folders in your project. And that's all!Beware fontawesome! Awesomeness is making things simple for the user!Using absolute instead of relative paths solved it for me. I was using relative paths (see first example below) and that didn't work. I checked via console and found the server was returning a 404, files not found. Relative path caused a 404: Absolute path solved it cross browser:I wouldn't recommend doing this unless you have to, but it works for me. Ofcourse, you should repeat this for all the font formats in the font-awesome.css file.It wasn't working for me because I had Allow from none directive for the root directory in my apache config. Here's how I got it to work...My directory structure:where my index.html has:I chose to continue to disallow access to my root and instead added another directory entry in my apache config for root/font-awesome/ My problem was with adding the inside a tagI fixed it by placing it outside the tag.What fixed the issue for me (on my Windows 7 machine) was decrypting my project directory. It's crazy how many visual and functional glitches originally arise from that when testing your website. Just get to a command prompt and run:...where %PROJECT_PATH% is the full pathname to the directory where your code is stored.

Can you save his sanity?In summary: How can a table's cells overflow evenly, and only when they've all given up all their whitespace?http://jsfiddle.net/7CURQ/I believe I have a non-javascript solution! Better late than never, right? After all this is an excellent question and Google is all over it. I didn't want to settle for a javascript fix because I find the slight jitter of things moving around after the page is loaded to be unacceptable.Features:How it works: Inside the table cell place two copies of the content in two different elements within a relatively-positioned container element. The spacer element is statically-positioned and as such will affect the width of the table cells. By allowing the contents of the spacer cell to wrap we can get the "best-fit" width of the table cells that we are looking for. This also allows us to use the absolutely-positioned element to restrict the width of the visible content to that of the relatively-positioned parent.Tested and working in: IE8, IE9, IE10, Chrome, Firefox, Safari, OperaResult Images:

JSFiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/zAeA2/Sample HTML/CSS:I've been faced the same challenge few days ago. It seems Lucifer Sam found the best solution.But I noticed you should duplicate content at spacer element. Thought it's not so bad, but I'd like also to apply title popup for clipped text. And it means long text will appear third time in my code.Here I propose to access title attribute from :after pseudo-element to generate spacer and keep HTML clean.Works on IE8+, FF, Chrome, Safari, Operahttp://jsfiddle.net/feesler/HQU5J/If Javascript is acceptable, I put together a quick routine which you could use as a starting point.  It dynamically tries to adapt the cell widths using the inner width of a span, in reaction to window resize events.  Currently it assumes that each cell normally gets 50% of the row width, and it will collapse the right cell to keep the left cell at its maximum width to avoid overflowing.  You could implement much more complex width balancing logic, depending on your use cases. Hope this helps:Markup for the row I used for testing:JQuery which hooks up the resize event:There's a much easier and more elegant solution.Within the table-cell that you want to apply truncation, simply include a container div with css table-layout: fixed. This container takes the full width of the parent table cell, so it even acts responsive.Make sure to apply truncation to the elements in the table.Works from IE8+and css:here's a working Fiddle

https://jsfiddle.net/d0xhz8tb/The problem is the 'table-layout:fixed' which create evenly-spaced-fixed-width columns. But disabling this css-property will kill the text-overflow because the table will become as large as possible (and than there is noting to overflow).I'm sorry but in this case Fred can't have his cake and eat it to.. unless the landlord gives Celldito less space to work with in the first place, Fred cannot use his..You could try to "weight" certain columns, like this:You can also try some more interesting tweaks, like using 0%-width columns and using some combination of the white-space CSS property.You get the idea.Yep I would say thirtydot has it, there is no way to do it unless you use a js method. You are talking about a complex set of rendering conditions that you will have to define. e.g. what happens when both cells are getting too big for their apartments you will have to decide who has priority or simply just give them a percentage of the area and if they are overfull they will both take up that area and only if one has whitespace will you stretch your legs in the other cell, either way there is no way to do it with css. Although there are some pretty funky things people do with css that I have not thought of. I really doubt you can do this though.Like samplebias answer, again if Javascript is an acceptable answer, I made a jQuery plugin specifically for this purpose: https://github.com/marcogrcr/jquery-tableoverflowTo use the plugin just typeFull example: http://jsfiddle.net/Cw7TD/3/embedded/result/Edits:Use some css hack, it seems the display: table-column; can come to rescue:JSFiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/blai/7u59asyp/This question pops up top in Google, so in my case, I used the css snippet

from https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/truncate-string-with-ellipsis/ but applying it to the td did NOT give the desired result.I had to add a div tag around the text in the td and the ellipsis finally worked.Abbreviated HTML Code;Abbreviated CSS;Simply add the following rules to your td:Example:PS:

If you want to set a custom width to another td use property min-width.Check if "nowrap" solve the issue to an extent. Note: nowrap is not supported in HTML5you can set the width of right cell to minimum of required width, then apply overflow-hidden+text-overflow to the  inside of left cell, but Firefox is buggy here...although, seems, flexbox can helpI've been recently working on it. Check out this jsFiddle test, try it yourself changing the width of the base table to check the behavior).The solution is to embedded a table into another:Is Fred now happy with Celldito's expansion?Don't know if this will help anyone, but I solved a similar problem by specifying specific width sizes in percentage for each column. Obviously, this would work best if each column has content with width that doesn't vary too widely.I had the same issue, but I needed to display multiple lines (where text-overflow: ellipsis; fails). I solve it using a textarea inside a TD and then style it to behave like a table cell.Given that 'table-layout:fixed' is the essential layout requirement, that this creates evenly spaced non-adjustable columns, but that you need to make cells of different percentage widths, perhaps set the 'colspan' of your cells to a multiple?For example, using a total width of 100 for easy percentage calculations, and saying that you need one cell of 80% and another of 20%, consider:Of course, for columns of 80% and 20%, you could just set the 100% width cell colspan to 5, the 80% to 4, and the 20% to 1.

Is there a way to have a child DIV within a parent container DIV that is wider than it's parent. The child DIV needs to be the same width of the browser viewport.See example below:

The child DIV must stay as a child of the parent div. I know I can set arbitrary negative margins on the child div to make it wider but I can't work out how to essentially make it 100% width of the browser.I know I can do this:But I need the child to be the same width as the browser which is dynamic.Thanks for your answers, it seems the closest answer so far is to make the child DIV position: absolute, and set the left and right properties to 0. The next problem I have is that the parent has position: relative, which means that left and right properties are still relative to the parent div and not the browser, see example here: jsfiddle.net/v2Tja/2I can't remove the position relative from the parent without screwing everything else up.

Without border-box, you would also have to subtract paddings and borders, making this solution a mess.Note: It is encouraged to hide horizontal overflow of your scrolling container, as certain browsers may choose to display a horizontal scrollbar despite there being no overflow.I've searched far and wide for a solution to this problem for a long time. Ideally we want to have the child greater than the parent, but without knowing the constraints of the parent in advance.And I finally found a brilliant generic answer here.

Copying it verbatim:Based on your suggestion original suggestion (setting negative margins), I have tried and come up with a similar method using percentage units for dynamic browser width:HTMLCSS:The negative margins will let the content flow out of the Parent DIV. Therefore I set the padding: 0 100%; to push the content back to the original boundaries of the Chlid DIV.The negative margins will also make the .child-div's total width expands out of the browser's viewport, resulting in a horizontal scroll. Hence we need to clip the extruding width by applying an overflow-x: hidden to a Grandparent DIV (which is the parent of the Parent Div):Here is the JSfiddleI haved tried Nils Kaspersson's left: calc(-50vw + 50%); it worked perfectly fine in Chrome & FF (not sure about IE yet) until I found out Safari browsers doesn't do it properly. Hope they fixed this soon as I actually like this simple method.This also may resolve your issue where the Parent DIV element has to be position:relativeThe 2 drawbacks of this workaround method is:Please let me know if there's any issue you find with this method ;). Hope it helps.I used this:HTMLCSSFlexbox can be used to make a child wider than its parent with three lines of CSS.Only the child’s display, margin-left and width need to be set. margin-left depends on the child’s width. The formula is:CSS variables can be used to avoid manually calculating the left margin.Demo #1: Manual calculationDemo #2: Using CSS variablesyou can try position: absolute. and give width and height , top: 'y axis from the top' 

and left: 'x-axis'I had a similar issue.

The content of the child element was supposed to stay in the parent element while the background had to extend the full viewport width.I resolved this issue by making the child element position: relative and adding a pseudo element (:before) to it with position: absolute; top: 0; bottom: 0; width: 4000px; left: -1000px;.

The pseudo element stays behind the actual child as a pseudo background element. This works in all browsers (even IE8+ and Safari 6+ - don't have the possibility to test older versions).Small example fiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/vccv39j9/Adding to Nils Kaspersson's solution, I am resolving for the width of the vertical scrollbar as well. I am using 16px as an example, which is subtracted from the view-port width. This will avoid the horizontal scrollbar from appearing.Assuming the parent has a fixed width, e.g #page { width: 1000px; } and is centered #page { margin: auto; }, you want the child to fit the width of browser viewport you could simply do:To make child div as wide as the content, try this:I know this is old but for anyone coming to this for an answer you would do it like so:Overflow hidden on a element containing the parent element, such as the body. Give your child element a width much wider than your page, and position it absolute left by -100%.Heres an example:Also heres a JS Fiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/v2Tja/288/Then solution will be the following.HTMLCSS

How do I make bigger Glyphicons in twitter bootstrap 3.0 (not 2.3.x). This code will make my glyphicons big:How can I get this size without using the btn-lg class while using only a span ?This gives a small glyphicon:You can just give the glyphicon a font-size to your liking:Here's how I do it:This allows you to change size on the fly.  Works best for ad hoc requirements to change the size, rather than changing the css and having it apply to all.The .btn-lg class has the following CSS in Bootstrap 3 (link):If you apply the same font-size and line-height to your span (either .glyphicon-link or a newly created .glyphicons-lg if you're going to use this effect in more than one instance), you'll get a Glyphicon the same size as the large button.In my case, I had an input-group-btn with a button, and this button was a little bigger than its container. So I just gave font-size:95% for my glyphicon and it was solved.Write your <span> in <h1> or <h2>:If you are using bootstrap 3, use tag, like this <small><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-send"></span></small> It works perfect for Bootstrap 3.

You can even use multiple <small> tags to set the size more smaller. 

Code:

<small><small><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-send"></span></small></small>

Ideally the truncation would happen in the browser, which knows the physical width of the rendered text.I've found that IE has a text-overflow: ellipsis property that does exactly what I want, but I need this to be cross-browser.  This property seems to be (somewhat?) standard but isn't supported by Firefox.

Yay! My original answer follows as a historical record.Justin Maxwell has cross browser CSS solution. It does come with the downside however of not allowing the text to be selected in Firefox. Check out his guest post on Matt Snider's blog for the full details on how this works.Note this technique also prevents updating the content of the node in JavaScript using the innerHTML property in Firefox. See the end of this post for a workaround.CSSellipsis.xml file contentsUpdating node contentTo update the content of a node in a way that works in Firefox use the following:See Matt Snider's post for an explanation of how this works.2014 March: Truncating long strings with CSS: a new answer with focus on browser supportDemo on http://jsbin.com/leyukama/1/ (I use jsbin because it supports old version of IE).The -ms-text-overflow CSS property is not necessary: it is a synonym of the text-overflow CSS property, but versions of IE from 6 to 11 already support the text-overflow CSS property.Successfully tested (on Browserstack.com) on Windows OS, for web browsers:Firefox: as pointed out by Simon Lieschke (in another answer), Firefox only support the text-overflow CSS property from Firefox 7 onwards (released September 27th 2011).I double checked this behavior on Firefox 3.0 & Firefox 6.0 (text-overflow is not supported).Some further testing on a Mac OS web browsers would be needed.Note: you may want to show a tooltip on mouse hover when an ellipsis is applied, this can be done via javascript, see this questions: HTML text-overflow ellipsis detection and HTML - how can I show tooltip ONLY when ellipsis is activatedResources:If you're OK with a JavaScript solution, there's a jQuery plug-in to do this in a cross-browser fashion - see http://azgtech.wordpress.com/2009/07/26/text-overflow-ellipsis-for-firefox-via-jquery/OK, Firefox 7 implemented text-overflow: ellipsis as well as text-overflow: "string". Final release is planned for 2011-09-27. Another solution to the problem could be the following set of CSS rules:The only drawback with the above CSS is that it would add the "..." irrespective of whether the text-overflows the container or not. Still, if you have a case where you have a bunch of elements and are sure that content will overflow, this one would be a simpler set of rules.My two cents. Hats off to the original technique by Justin MaxwellFor reference, here's a link to the "bug" tracking text-overflow: ellipsis support in Firefox.  Sounds like Firefox is the only major browser left that doesn't support a native CSS solution.

There are multiple techniques to accomplish what you want at the end of the discussion.(Super-short summary: either set the line-height of the child equal to the height of the container, or set positioning on the container and absolutely position the child at top:50% with margin-top:-YYYpx, YYY being half the known height of the child.)At your parent DIV addand at your child element addQuick answer for single line spanMake the child (in this case a span) the same line-height as the parent <div>'s heightYou should then add the CSS rulesOr you can target it with a child selector Background on my own use of thisI ran into this similar issue where I needed to vertically center items in a mobile menu. I made the div and spans inside the same line height. Note that this is for a meteor project and therefore not using inline css ;)HTMLCSS (option for multiple spans in a div)In this case if I just had one span I could have added the CSS rule directly to that span. CSS (option for one specific span)Here is how it displayed for me As in a similar question, use display: inline-block with a placeholder element to vertically center the span inside of a block element:Vertical alignment is only applied to inline elements or table cells, so use it along with display:inline-block or display:table-cell with a display:table parent when vertically centering block elements. References:CSS Horizontal and Vertical CenteringTo the parent div add a height say 50px. In the child span, add the line-height: 50px; 

Now the text in the span will be vertically center. This worked for me.

I’m working on a CSS file that is quite long. I know that the client could ask for changes to the color scheme, and was wondering: is it possible to assign colors to variables, so that I can just change a variable to have the new color applied to all elements that use it?Please note that I can’t use PHP to dynamically change the CSS file.CSS supports this natively with CSS Variables.Example CSS fileFor a working example, please see this JSFiddle (the example shows one of the CSS selectors in the fiddle has the color hard coded to blue, the other CSS selector uses CSS variables, both original and current syntax, to set the color to blue).Manipulating a CSS variable in JavaScript/client sideSupport is in all the modern browsersFirefox 31+, Chrome 49+, Safari 9.1+, Microsoft Edge 15+ and Opera 36+ ship with native support for CSS variables.People keep upvoting my answer, but it's a terrible solution compared to the joy of sass or less, particularly given the number of easy to use gui's for both these days. If you have any sense ignore everything I suggest below.You could put a comment in the css before each colour in order to serve as a sort of variable, which you can change the value of using find/replace, so...At the top of the css fileLater in the CSS fileThen to, for example, change the colour scheme for the box text you do a find/replace on CSS itself doesn't use variables. However, you can use another language like SASS to define your styling using variables, and automatically produce CSS files, which you can then put up on the web. Note that you would have to re-run the generator every time you made a change to your CSS, but that isn't so hard.You can try CSS3 variables:There's no easy CSS only solution.  You could do this:Yeeeaaahhh.... you can now use var() function in CSS.....The good news is you can change it using JavaScript access, which will change globally as well... But how to declare them...It's quite simple:For example, you wanna assign a #ff0000 to a var(), just simply assign it in :root, also pay attention to --:The good things are the browser support is not bad, also don't need to be compiled to be used in the browser like LESS or SASS...Also, here is a simple JavaScript script, which changes the red value to blue:The 'Less' Ruby Gem for CSS looks awesome. http://lesscss.org/Yes, in near future (i write this in june 2012) you can define native css variables, without using less/sass etc ! The Webkit engine just implemented first css variable rules, so cutting edge versions of Chrome and Safari are already to work with them. See the Official Webkit (Chrome/Safari) development log  with a onsite css browser demo.Hopefully we can expect widespread browser support of native css variables in the next few months.Do not use css3 variables due to support. I would do the following if you want a pure css solution.You could pass the CSS through javascript and replace all instances of COLOUR1 with a certain color (basically regex it) and provide a backup stylesheet incase the end user has JS turned offI'm not clear on why you can't use PHP. You could then simply add and use variables as you wish, save the file as a PHP file and link to that .php file as the style sheet instead of the .css file.It doesn't have to be PHP, but you get what I mean.When we want programming stuff, why not use a programming language until CSS (maybe) supports things like variables?Also, check out Nicole Sullivan's Object-oriented CSS.dicejs.com (formally cssobjs) is a client-side version of SASS. You can set variables in your CSS (stored in json formatted CSS) and re-use your color variables.And here is a link to a complete downloadable demo which is a little more helpful then their documentation : dicejs demoConsider using SCSS. It's full compatible with CSS syntax, so a valid CSS file is also a valid SCSS file. This makes migration easy, just change the suffix. It has numerous enhancements, the most useful being variables and nested selectors.You need to run it through a pre-processor to convert it to CSS before shipping it to the client. I've been a hardcore CSS developer for many years now, but since forcing myself to do a project in SCSS, I now won't use anything else.If you have Ruby on your system you can do this:http://unixgods.org/~tilo/Ruby/Using_Variables_in_CSS_Files_with_Ruby_on_Rails.htmlThis was made for Rails, but see below for how to modify it to run it stand alone.You could use this method independently from Rails, by writing a small Ruby wrapper script 

which works in conjunction with site_settings.rb and takes your CSS-paths into account, and 

which you can call every time you want to re-generate your CSS (e.g. during site startup)You can run Ruby on pretty much any operating system, so this should be fairly platform independent.e.g. wrapper:  generate_CSS.rb  (run this script whenever you need to generate your CSS)the generate_CSS_files method in site_settings.rb then needs to be modified like this:You can group selectors:Sure can, sort of, thanks to the wonderful world of multiple classes, can do this:but I often end up combining them anyway like this:I know the semantic police will be all over you, but it works.Not PHP I'm afraid, but Zope and Plone use something similar to SASS called DTML to achieve this. It's incredibly useful in CMS's.Upfront Systems has a good example of its use in Plone.If you write the css file as an xsl template, you could read color values from a simple xml file. Then create the css with an xslt processor.colors.xml:styles.xsl:Command to render css: xsltproc -o styles.css styles.xsl colors.xmlstyles.css:It’s not possible with CSS alone.You can do it with JavaScript and LESS using less.js, which will render LESS variables into CSS live, but it’s for development only and adds too much overhead for real-life use.The closest you can come with CSS is to use an attribute substring selector like this:and set the ids of all your elements that you want to be adjusted to names starting with colvar-, such as colvar-header. Then when you change the color, all the ID styles are updated. That’s as close as you can get with CSS alone.

[Only detect click event on pseudo-element](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7478336/only-detect-click-event-on-pseudo-element)

My code is:Please see this fiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/ZWw3Z/5/I would like to trigger a click event only on the pseudo-element (the red bit). That is, I don't want the click event to be triggered on the blue bit.

My code is:Please see this fiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/ZWw3Z/5/I would like to trigger a click event only on the pseudo-element (the red bit). That is, I don't want the click event to be triggered on the blue bit.This is not possible; pseudo-elements are not part of the DOM at all so you can't bind any events directly to them, you can only bind to their parent elements.If you must have a click handler on the red region only, you have to make a child element, like a span, place it right after the opening <p> tag, apply styles to p span instead of p:before, and bind to it.Actually, it is possible. You can check if the clicked position was outside of the element, since this will only happen if ::before or ::after was clicked.This example only checks the element to the right but that should work in your case.JSFiddleOn modern browsers you can try with the pointer-events css property (but it leads to the impossibility to detect mouse events on the parent node):When the event target is your "p" element, you know it is your "p:before".If you still need to detect mouse events on the main p, you may consider the possibility to modify your HTML structure. You can add a span tag and the following style:The event targets are now both the "span" and the "p:before" elements.Example without jquery: http://jsfiddle.net/2nsptvcu/Example with jquery: http://jsfiddle.net/0vygmnnb/Here is the list of browsers supporting pointer-events: http://caniuse.com/#feat=pointer-eventsMy answer will work for anyone wanting to click a definitive area of the page. This worked for me on my absolutely-positioned :afterThanks to this article, I realized (with jQuery) I can use e.pageY and e.pageX instead of worrying about e.offsetY/X and e.clientY/X issue between browsers.I liked this event.pageY idea because it would always be the same, as it was relative to the document. I can compare it to my :after's parent element using offset(), which returns its X and Y also relative to the document. Therefore, I can come up with a range of "clickable" region on the entire page that never changes.Here's my demo on codepen.or if too lazy for codepen, here's the JS:* I only cared about the Y values for my example.Short Answer:I did it. 

I wrote a function for dynamic usage for all the little people out there... Working example which displays on the pageWorking example logging to the consoleLong Answer:...Still did it.It took me awhile to do it, since a psuedo element is not really on the page. While some of the answers above work in SOME scenarios, they ALL fail to be both dynamic and work in a scenario in which an element is both unexpected in size and position(such as absolute positioned elements overlaying a portion of the parent element). Mine does not. Usage:How it works:It grabs the height, width, top, and left positions(based on the position away from the edge of the window) of the parent element and grabs the height, width, top, and left positions(based on the edge of the parent container) and compares those values to determine where the psuedo element is on the screen.It then compares where the mouse is. As long as the mouse is in the newly created variable range then it returns true.Note:It is wise to make the parent element RELATIVE positioned. If you have an absolute positioned psuedo element, this function will only work if it is positioned based on the parent's dimensions(so the parent has to be relative...maybe sticky or fixed would work too....I dont know).Code:Support:I dont know....it looks like ie is dumb and likes to return auto as a computed value sometimes. IT SEEMS TO WORK WELL IN ALL BROWSERS IF DIMENSIONS ARE SET IN CSS. So...set your height and width on your psuedo elements and only move them with top and left. I recommend using it on things that you are okay with it not working on. Like an animation or something. Chrome works...as usual.This works for me:Add condition in Click event to restrict the clickable area . None of these answers are reliable, and mine wont be much more reliable. Caveats aside, if you do get into the lucky scenario where the element you're trying to have clicked doesn't have padding (such that all of the "inner" space of the element is completely covered by sub-elements), then you can check the target of the click event against the container itself. If it matches, that means you've clicked a :before or :after element.Obviously this would not be feasible with both types (before and after) however I have implemented it as a hack/speed fix and it is working very well, without a bunch of position checking, which may be inaccurate depending on about a million different factors.Shortest example of code:pointer-events control detection of events, removing receiving events from target, but keep receiving from pseudo-elements make possible to click on ::before and ::after and you will always know what you are clicking on pseudo-element, however if you still need to click, you put all content in nested element (span in example), but because we don't want to apply any additional styles, display: contents; become very handy solution and it supported by most browsers. pointer-events: none; as already mentioned in original post also widely supported.The JavaScript part also used widely supported Array.from and for...of, however they are not necessary to use in code. No,but you can do like thisIn html file add this sectionIn css you can do like this}

Simulating tremor (from e.g. Parkinson's Disease) with the mouse on a webpage?

I'm working for a foundation that raises awareness for accessibility in the internet. For a presentation, we want to offer a small workshop that simulates different disabilities/impairments to people. This is done via a website created especially for this presentation.One of the demonstrated impairments is having a tremor, which means experiencing shaky, difficult-to-control hand movements. With this impairment, it's very difficult to move the mouse cursor exactly and to press the mouse button while the mouse is over a link. Both some old people and people with disease, e.g. Parkinson's, can suffer from tremor.Now I'd like to somehow move the mouse cursor in an unpredictable way, so that it's very hard for people to click on a small button. Because JavaScript doesn't allow moving the mouse cursor directly, I'm looking for other ways to achieve this. I came up with the following ideas:While the first idea would be pretty cool, I couldn't find a tool like this, whether for Mac nor for Windows. And I don't have any skills in programming such a thing myself.The second idea seems a bit clumsy, but it would achieve the desired effect, I think.Does anybody have another idea?

And I don't have any skills in programming such a thing myself.The second idea seems a bit clumsy, but it would achieve the desired effect, I think.Does anybody have another idea?I made a quick demo of something that you hopefully should be able to base your code on, using the Pointer Lock API.I forked this pointer-lock-demo repo and modified it to add a random movement element.Here is the link to my GitHub page: https://aristocrates.github.io/pointer-lock-demo

And here is the link to my repo: https://github.com/aristocrates/pointer-lock-demoThe javascript code of importance is contained in app.js, in the canvasLoop(e) method.The only thing I changed from the original demo was after the linesI added two lines to represent random movement:There are still plenty of things you could improve, but hopefully this can help you get started.Actually, I like solutions, which may be based on javascript, since they are more likely web-related, and good chances are — OS-independent. However, I was thinking about — how to resolve your issue for all browsers, since javascript solutions, in this case, will be difficult to adjust for all possible browsers (I'm not sure if it's possible at all).So, as you've mentioned, there is another way — i.e. to emulate the behavior on OS level. This has another advantage too — you may be sure that for browser it looks 100% as it was human (because, well, it's driver which is sending the signal). So you may use driver/device-based solutions with any browsers (or even in situation, when javascript is disabled).Unfortunately, involving driver/device immediately causes OS dependency. So for each OS you'll need own solution. In this post I'm focused on Linux-based solution (so, will work with Linux) — and Mac OS a little. With Linux, it's possible to write events to device explicitly, so below is sample of function with main loop:My full code for the issue be found here. 

The program will ask for amplitude of "tremor" and it's frequency (thus, how many time in micro-seconds are between "tremors"). To emulate situation, it will force mouse to move randomly for 0..X points in random direction (up-down-left-bottom) and wait randomly 0..Y micro-seconds till next "tremor", there X is amplitude of "tremor" and Y is frequency of "tremor"Another thing may be to adapt the program for your system. The program is "dummy" and can't detect mouse by itself, so "/dev/input/event4" is hard-coded. To realize what may be identifier for your system you may try:And so possibilities are "event3" and "event4" — but for your system that may have other values. So, if that is different from currently used in C code, just change the corresponding line (so, line with int  fd = open("/dev/input/event4", O_RDWR); and place your device instead of event4)A gif demo for this program (low frame rate, unfortunately, so keep image not too large) here. A little side note (if you don't know what to do with C code) — to compile program above, just use:where file.c is the name of your C source code file, then you'll get executable, called m in your directory. Most likely you'll need permissions to write into mouse device directly, so you may use sudo:The logic will remain same:That's it. For instance, Mac OS has its own way to work with mouse (not like Linux, Mac hasn't procfs as well), it's well-described here. What is better — javascript or device-oriented solutions — is up to you, because certain condition (like cross-browser or cross-OS) may decide everything in this case. Therefore, I've provided guidelines together with certain working example of how to implement that on OS level. The benefit here is that solution is cross-browser, but as a cost we have OS-binded program. I did this as a joke once, on the Puppy Linux Forum and got the comment that:Here is the shell script which requires xdotoolName as parkinson_sim and run with optional argument for the time between tremors which can be 0.001 to 999.0. I made the mistake of clicking on it myself instead of running it from the command line and quickly discovered how frustrating it must be.  It took me several tries to get a terminal window open to kill it.Your second idea (hide the cursor) is halfway to one that I think may work well for you:Then, you add some tremor math to your cursor code, to "shake" the cursor. Up to you to determine what the right curves are to properly simulate tremor input.Finally: for whatever controls you are programming (links, etc.):One major bonus with this implementation: your 'shaky cursor' will be displayed on touch devices, which would not have a cursor to begin with.Based on Michael Theriot's (very clean and helpful!) base JSFiddle from the comments, here's one that tremors constantly with a normally-distributed sweep around the current cursor location: http://jsfiddle.net/benmosher/0x4mc64v/4/(The normal array is the result of calling rnorm(100) in my R console. Simplest way I could think of in JS to sample a normally-distributed random integer.)Just an idea for getting the tremor "right", you can record the mouse movement of a real patient, this makes it more authentic when you tell people where the data comes from.There a scripts for letting a cat follow your mouse cursor, you could adjust one to let a second cursor follow (jump around) your cursor. The page is calculating the position of the the second cursor, so it can also determine if an click event is successful or not.If you can, please make it web based, you will reach a lot more people this way than asking them to install a program or activate flash or whatever there is.Instead of trying to move the pointer, you could move the application (web page) instead. I wrote a simple html form that has some entry fields in it. When you move the mouse onto the form, the form moves.You can see a demo of the moving form at jsfiddle. Try to click on one of the input fields to see the effect.I used the jquery shake effect to achieve this. The javascript for the shake effect looks like this, and just causes the form to move up and down whenever the mouse is moved over it:Although the form only moves up and down, I think it has the desired effect. You can play with the parameters (direction, times, distance, as well as the un-named "1000" above) to tweak the form movement.Why not use a hardware solution? There are certain mice out there that you can put weights in, like the Logitech G500. Instead of putting in a weight, put in a small oscillating motor that makes the mouse shake slightly. This also simulated the actual disorder more: it's not just the cursor that shakes, but the entire hand and mouse. And it also means you can show other software than websites.Instead of a mouse with a weight slot, you can also just tape something to the mouse, but that's more noticeable.As you were thinking about doing it with a custom mouse driver I suppose a small program running on the PC would do either? If this is the case, here is a small snippet for C#, which infinitely moves the cursor randomly withing a range of plus minus 5px around the current cursor position. After each displacement the program waits 50 ms to 100 ms (not accurate!). The shakiness can be configured by adapting the values for the displacement and the pauses. I ran this in a console application and - depending on the values - it gave me quite a hard time stopping the program.Here is a windows version of my xdotool script that uses AutoIt. This was my first ever AutoIt script, and it took only a couple of minutes to write, so I'm sure it can be improved.  Just save with the extension .au3 and run it with AutoIt (Run Script x86).ControlsOr use my compiled version from here.You can't expect anyone to be able to hold their hands perfectly steady, so one thing you can consider is, My reasoning is (caveat, I am not an expert in ux or medicine) by making the click-able elements smaller, you creates a similar problem for most people that a person afflicted with Parkinson's disease would face with an everyday web site. You can use an old-age simulation suit, such as the one described in this article... I suspect the hand-tremors part is just a vibrating motor strapped around the wrist, plus some thick gloves to make the hands generally clumsy.Note: The script cannot know if the hand is still on the mouse ;)The low-level parts of simulating the tremor are well answered by now. I will add something focusing on the kind of tremor to simulate:Most answers implement a mouse cursor that is moving on a random path with some fixed maximal step width in X and Y direction.This should work well enough for the use case of making it hard to hit a specific area like a button.    For the more general issue of simulating UI problems caused by a tremor from Parkinson's disease, it would be at least interesting to actually simulate the hand movements of this kind of tremor.

I suspect the random walk may not be a very good approximation.It may be hard to get hold of real hand trace data of tremor movement of course, but there are certainly papers about analyzing this kind of tremor:The paper Parametric Representation of Hand Movement in Parkinson’s Disease is about how to best plot 3D hand movement traces.

The paper is paywalled, but the preview on the top right, labeled "Look Inside >" on the book image, shows some interesting plots of different representations of hand trace data.
