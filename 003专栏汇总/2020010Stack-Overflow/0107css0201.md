I have a div that's width is 100%.I'd like to center a button within it, how might I do this?Updated AnswerUpdating because I noticed it's an active answer, however Flexbox would be the correct approach now.Live DemoVertical and horizontal alignment.Just horizontal (as long as the main flex axis is horizontal which is default)Original Answer using a fixed width and no flexboxIf the original poster wants vertical and center alignment its quite easy for fixed width and height of the button, try the followingLive DemoCSSfor just horizontal alignment use eitherorYou could just make:Or you could do it like this instead:The first one will center align everything inside the div. The other one will center align just the button.et voila:Update: If OP is looking for horizontal and vertical centre, this answer will do it for a fixed width/height element.Margin: 0 auto; is the correct answer for horizontal centering only.

For centering both ways something like this will work, using jquery:Update ... five years later, one could use flexbox on the parent DIV element to easily center the button both horizontally and vertically.

To center an image in Bootstrap 4, use mx-auto d-block...Twitter bootstrap has a class that centers: .pagination-centeredIt worked for me to do:The css for the class is:You could use the following. It supports Bootstrap 3.x above.Assuming there is nothing else alongside the image, the best way is to use text-align: center in the img parent:EditAs mentioned in the other answers, you can add the bootstrap CSS class .text-center to the parent element. This does exactly the same thing and is available in both v2.3.3 and v3Works for me. try using center-blockI need the same and here I found the solution:https://stackoverflow.com/a/15084576/1140407and to CSS:You can use margin property with the bootstrap img class.Seems we could use a new HTML5 feature if the browser version is not a problem:in HTML files :And in CSS file, we write:And so the div could be perfectly center in browser.You should use I am using justify-content-center class to a row within a container. Works well with Bootstrap 4.I created this and added to Site.css.You could change the CSS of the previous solution as below:This should center all the elements in the parent div as well.

How to add style=display:"block" to an element in jQuery?Edit: or as dave thieben points out in his comment below, you can do this as well:Depending on the purpose of setting the display property, you might want to take a look atandThere are multiple function to do this work that wrote in bottom based on priority.Set one or more CSS properties for the set of matched elements. Display the matched elements and is roughly equivalent to calling .css("display", "block")You can display element using .show() insteadSet one or more attributes for the set of matched elements. If target element hasn't style attribute, you can use this method to add inline style to element.You can add specific CSS property to element using pure javascript, if you don't want to use jQuery.If you need to add multiple then you can do it like this:As a good practice I would also put the property name between quotes to allow the dash since most styles have a dash in them. If it was 'display', then quotes are optional but if you have a dash, it will not work without the quotes. Anyways, to make it simple: always enclose them in quotes.

Right now, I have the hyperlink font size spec'ed to 14px, but when switching to landscape, it blows way up to like 20px. I want the font-size to stay the same. Here is the code:You can disable this behavior through the -webkit-text-size-adjust CSS property:The use of this property is described further in the Safari Web Content Guide.Note: if you usethen this will disable zoom behavior in default browsers. A better solution is:This corrects the iPhone/iPad behavior, without changing desktop behavior.Using -webkit-text-size-adjust: none; directly on html breaks the ability to zoom text in all webkit browsers. You should combine this with som media queries specific for iOS. For example:As it was mentioned before, CSS ruledoes no longer work in modern devices.Fortunately, a new solution comes for iOS5 and iOS6 (todo: what about iOS7?):You can also add , user-scalable=0 to turn off pinch zooming, so your website would behave like a native app. If your design brakes when user zooms, use this meta tag instead:You can add a meta in the HTML header:<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width; initial-scale=1.0; maximum-scale=1.0; user-scalable=0;" />You could also opt for using a CSS reset, such as normalize.css, which includes the same rule that crazygringo recommends:As you see, it also includes a vendor specific rule for the IE Phone. For current information about the implementation in different browsers, refer to the MDN reference page.The below code works for me. Try with clearing your browser cache if it does not work. As of March 2019 text-size-adjust has a reasonable support amongst mobile browsers.Using viewport meta tag has no effect on the text size adjustment and setting user-scalable: no does not even work in IOS Safari. In my case this trouble has been because I used CSS attribute width: 100% for HTML tag input type="text". I changed value of width to 60% and add padding-right:38%.

Why doesn't the height of a container element increase if it contains floated elements?

I would like to ask how height and float work. I have an outer div and an inner div that has content in it. Its height may vary depending on the content of the inner div but it seems that my inner div will overflow its outside div. What would be the proper way to do it?The floated elements do not add to the height of the container element, and hence if you don't clear them, container height won't increase...I'll show you visually:More Explanation:You can also add overflow: hidden; on container elements, but I would suggest you use clear: both; instead.Also if you might like to self-clear an element you can useTaking a case as an example to explain how CSS floats work, assuming we need a simple 2 column layout with a header, footer, and 2 columns, so here is what the blueprint looks like...In the above example, we will be floating only the red boxes, either you can float both to the left, or you can float on to left, and another to right as well, depends on the layout, if it's 3 columns, you may float 2 columns to left where another one to the right so depends, though in this example, we have a simplified 2 column layout so will float one to left and the other to the right.Markup and styles for creating the layout explained further down...Let's go step by step with the layout and see how float works.. First of all, we use the main wrapper element, you can just assume that it's your viewport, then we use header and assign a height of 50px so nothing fancy there. It's just a normal non floated block level element which will take up 100% horizontal space unless it's floated or we assign inline-block to it.The first valid value for float is left so in our example, we use float: left; for .floated_left, so we intend to float a block to the left of our container element.Column floated to the leftAnd yes, if you see, the parent element, which is .wrapper is collapsed, the one you see with a green border didn't expand, but it should right? Will come back to that in a while, for now, we have got a column floated to left.Coming to the second column, lets it float this one to the rightAnother column floated to the rightHere, we have a 300px wide column which we float to the right, which will sit beside the first column as it's floated to the left, and since it's floated to the left, it created empty gutter to the right, and since there was ample of space on the right, our right floated element sat perfectly beside the left one.Still, the parent element is collapsed, well, let's fix that now. There are many ways to prevent the parent element from getting collapsed.Add, <div style="clear: both;"></div> before the .wrapper div ends, likeDemoWell, that fixes very well, no collapsed parent anymore, but it adds unnecessary markup to the DOM, so some suggest, to use overflow: hidden; on the parent element holding floated child elements which work as intended.Use overflow: hidden; on .wrapperDemoThat saves us an element every time we need to clear float but as I tested various cases with this, it failed in one particular one, which uses box-shadow on the child elements.Demo (Can't see the shadow on all 4 sides, overflow: hidden; causes this issue)So what now? Save an element, no overflow: hidden; so go for a clear fix hack, use the below snippet in your CSS, and just as you use overflow: hidden; for the parent element, call the class below on the parent element to self-clear.DemoHere, shadow works as intended, also, it self-clears the parent element which prevents to collapse.And lastly, we use footer after we clear the floated elements.DemoWhen is float: none; used anyways, as it is the default, so any use to declare float: none;?Well, it depends, if you are going for a responsive design, you will use this value a lot of times, when you want your floated elements to render one below another at a certain resolution. For that float: none; property plays an important role there.Few real-world examples of how float is useful.Demo (Without floating img)Demo 2 (img floated to the left)Last but not the least, I want to explain this particular case where you float only single element to the left but you do not float the other, so what happens?Suppose if we remove float: right; from our .floated_right class, the div will be rendered from extreme left as it isn't floated.DemoSo in this case, either you can float the to the left as well OR You can use margin-left which will be equal to the size of the left floated column i.e 200px wide.You need to add overflow:auto to your parent div for it to encompass the inner floated div:jsFiddle exampleYou are encountering the float bug (though I'm not sure if it's technically a bug due to how many browsers exhibit this behaviour).  Here is what is happening:Under normal circumstances, assuming that no explicit height has been set, a block level element such as a div will set its height based on its content.  The bottom of the parent div will extend beyond the last element.  Unfortunately, floating an element stops the parent from taking the floated element into account when determining its height.  This means that if your last element is floated, it will not "stretch" the parent in the same way a normal element would.ClearingThere are two common ways to fix this.  The first is to add a "clearing" element; that is, another element below the floated one that will force the parent to stretch.  So add the following html as the last child:It shouldn't be visible, and by using clear:both, you make sure that it won't sit next to the floated element, but after it.Overflow:The second method, which is preferred by most people (I think) is to change the CSS of the parent element so that the overflow is anything but "visible".  So setting the overflow to "hidden" will force the parent to stretch beyond the bottom of the floated child.  This is only true if you haven't set a height on the parent, of course.Like I said, the second method is preferred as it doesn't require you to go and add semantically meaningless elements to your markup, but there are times when you need the overflow to be visible, in which case adding a clearing element is more than acceptable.Its because of the float of the div. Add overflow: hidden on the outside element.DemoYou confuse how browsers renders the elements when there are floating elements. If one block element is floating (your inner div in your case), other block elements will ignore it because browser removes floating elements from the normal flow of the web page. Then, because the floated div has been removed from the normal flow, the outside div is filled in, like the inner div isn't there. However, inline elements (images, links, text, blackquotes) will respect the boundaries of the floating element. If you introduce text in the outside div, the text will place arround de inner div.In other words, block elements (headers, paragraphs, divs, etc) ignore floating elements and fill in, and inline elements (images, links, text, etc) respect boundaries of floating elements.An fiddle example hereyou can use overflow property to the container div if you don't have any div to show over the container eg:Here is the following css:-----------------------OR------------------------------Here is the following css:Try this one

Below is what I tried but which did not work. Is there a way to put the colored layer over the background image? Here's my CSS:Here it is:HTML for this:Of course you need to define a width and height to the .background class, if there are no other elements inside of itI know this is a really old thread, but it shows up at the top in Google, so here's another option.This one is pure CSS, and doesn't require any extra HTML.There are a surprising number of uses for the box-shadow feature.From CSS-Tricks... there is a one step way to do this without z-indexing and adding pseudo elements-- requires linear gradient which I think means you need CSS3 supportYou can also use a linear gradient and an image:

http://codepen.io/anon/pen/RPweoxThis is because the linear gradient function creates an Image which is added to the background stack. https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/linear-gradientYou need then a wrapping element with the bg image and in it the content element with the bg color:and the css:Try this. Works for me.I've used this as a way to both apply colour tints as well as gradients to images to make dynamic overlaying text easier to style for legibility when you can't control image colour profiles. You don't have to worry about z-index. HTMLSASSCSSHope it helpsSee my answer at https://stackoverflow.com/a/18471979/193494 for a comprehensive overview of possible solutions: Why so complicated? Your solution was almost right except it's a way easier to make the pattern transparent and the background color solid. PNG can contain transparencies. So use photoshop to make the pattern transparent by setting the layer to 70% and resaving your image. Then you only need one selector. Works cross browser.CSS:HTML:This are the basic. A usage example follows where I switched from background to background-image but both properties works the same.PLEASE WAIT A MINUTE! IT TAKES SOME TIME TO LOAD THE EXTERNAL PATTERNS.This website seems to be rather slow...You can use a semitransparent pixel, which you can generate for example here, even in base64

 Here is an example with white 50%:Here is a more simple trick with only css.Another one with an SVG as inline overlay-image (note: if you use # inside the svg-code you have to urlencode that!):

Is it possible to define a CSS style for an element, that is only applied if the matching element contains a specific element (as the direct child item)?I think this is best explained using an example.Note: I'm trying to style the parent element, depending on what child elements it contains.Note 2: I know I can achieve this using javascript, but I just wondered whether this is possible using some unknown (to me) CSS features.As far as I'm aware, styling a parent element based on the child element is not an available feature of CSS. You'll likely need scripting for this.It'd be wonderful if you could do something like div[div.a] or div:containing[div.a] as you said, but this isn't possible. You may want to consider looking at jQuery. Its selectors work very well with 'containing' types. You can select the div, based on its child contents and then apply a CSS class to the parent all in one line.If you use jQuery, something along the lines of this would may work (untested but the theory is there):orcombined with a CSS class:Here's the documentation for the jQuery "has" selector.Basically, no. The following would be what you were after in theory:Unfortunately it doesn't exist.There are a few write-ups along the lines of "why the hell not". A well fleshed out one by Shaun Inman is pretty good:http://www.shauninman.com/archive/2008/05/05/css_qualified_selectorsOn top of @kp's answer:I'm dealing with this and in my case, I have to show a child element and correct the height of the parent object accordingly (auto-sizing is not working in a bootstrap header for some reason I don't have time to debug). But instead of using javascript to modify the parent, I think I'll dynamically add a CSS class to the parent and CSS-selectively show the children accordingly. This will maintain the decisions in the logic and not based on a CSS state. tl;dr; apply the a and b styles to the parent <div>, not the child (of course, not everyone will be able to do this. i.e. Angular components making decisions of their own).In my case, I had to change the cell padding of an element that contained an input checkbox for a table that's being dynamically rendered with DataTables: After implementing the following line code within the initComplete function I was able to produce the correct padding, which fixed the rows from being displayed with an abnormally large heightNow, you can see that the correct styles are being applied to the parent element: Essentially, this answer is an extension of @KP's answer, but the more collaboration of implementing this the better. In summation, I hope this helps someone else because it works! Lastly, thank you so much @KP for leading me in the right direction!

I have got a span with dynamic data in my page, with ellipsis style.I'd like to add to this element tooltip with the same content, but I want it to appear only when the content is long and the ellipsis appear on screen.

Is there any way to do it?

Does the browser throw an event when ellipsis is activated?*Browser: Internet ExplorerHere's a way that does it using the built-in ellipsis setting, and adds the title attribute on-demand (with jQuery) building on Martin Smith's comment:Here's a pure CSS solution. No need for jQuery.

It won't show a tooltip, instead it'll just expand the content to its full length on mouseover.Works great if you have content that gets replaced. Then you don't have to run a jQuery function every time.uosɐſ's answer is fundamentally correct, but you probably don't want to do it in the mouseenter event. That's going to cause it to do the calculation to determine if it's needed, each time you mouse over the element. Unless the size of the element is changing, there's no reason to do that.It would be better to just call this code immediately after the element is added to the DOM:Or, if you don't know when exactly it's added, then call that code after the page is finished loading.if you have more than a single element that you need to do this with, then you can give them all the same class (such as "mightOverflow"), and use this code to update them all:Here is my jQuery plugin:Usage:Edit:I have made a gist for this plugin.

https://gist.github.com/UziTech/d45102cdffb1039d4415Here are two other pure CSS solutions:We need to detect whether ellipsis is really applied, then to show a tooltip to reveal full text. It is not enough by only comparing "this.offsetWidth < this.scrollWidth" when the element nearly holding its content but only lacking one or two more pixels in width, especially for the text of full-width Chinese/Japanese/Korean characters.Here is an example: http://jsfiddle.net/28r5D/5/I found a way to improve ellipsis detection:Here is my improvement: http://jsfiddle.net/28r5D/6/I created a jQuery plugin that uses Bootstrap's tooltip instead of the browser's build-in tooltip. Please note that this has not been tested with older browser.JSFiddle: https://jsfiddle.net/0bhsoavy/4/This is what I did.  Most tooltip scripts require you to execute a function that stores the tooltips.  This is a jQuery example:If you didn't want to check for ellipsis css, you could simplify like:I have the "when" around it, so that the "setupTooltip" function doesn't execute until all titles have been updated.  Replace the "setupTooltip", with your tooltip function and the * with the elements you want to check.  * will go through them all if you leave it.If you simply want to just update the title attributes with the browsers tooltip, you can simplify like:Or without check for ellipsis:If you want to do this solely using javascript, I would do the following. Give the span an id attribute (so that it can easily be retrieved from the DOM) and place all the content in an attribute named 'content':Then, in your javascript, you can do the following after the element has been inserted into the DOM.Of course, if you're using javascript to insert the span into the DOM, you could just keep the content in a variable before inserting it. This way you don't need a content attribute on the span.There are more elegant solutions than this if you want to use jQuery.I have CSS class, which determines where to put ellipsis. Based on that, I do the following (element set could be different, i write those, where ellipsis is used, of course it could be a separate class selector):Here's a Vanilla JavaScript solution:None of the solutions above worked for me, but I figured out a great solution. The biggest mistake people are making is having all the 3 CSS properties declared on the element upon pageload. You have to add those styles+tooltip dynamically IF and ONLY IF the span you want an ellipses on is wider than its parent.You could possibly surround the span with another span, then simply test if the width of the original/inner span is greater than that of the new/outer span.  Note that I say possibly -- it is roughly based on my situation where I had a span inside of a td so I don't actually know that if it will work with a span inside of a span.  Here though is my code for others who may find themselves in a position similar to mine; I'm copying/pasting it without modification even though it is in an Angular context, I don't think that detracts from the readability and the essential concept.  I coded it as a service method because I needed to apply it in more than one place.  The selector I've been passing in has been a class selector that will match multiple instances.This was my solution, works as a charm!

I know that setting margin: 0 auto; on an element is used to centre it (left-right). However, I know that the element and its parent must meet certain criteria for the auto margin to work, and I can never seem to get the magic right.So my question is simple: what CSS properties have to be set on an element and its parent in order for margin: 0 auto; to left-right centre the child?

I know that setting margin: 0 auto; on an element is used to centre it (left-right). However, I know that the element and its parent must meet certain criteria for the auto margin to work, and I can never seem to get the magic right.So my question is simple: what CSS properties have to be set on an element and its parent in order for margin: 0 auto; to left-right centre the child?Off the top of my head:Off the top of other people's heads:Note that all of these conditions must be true of the element being centered for it to work.1 There is one exception to this: if your fixed or absolutely positioned element has left: 0; right: 0, it will center with auto margins.2 Technically, margin: 0 auto does work with an auto width, but the auto width takes precedence over the auto margins, and the auto margins are zeroed out as a result, making it seem as though they "don't work".Off the top of my head, it needs a width. You need to specify the width of the container you are centering (not the parent width).Complete rule for CSS:Off the top of my head, if the element is not a block element - make it so.and then give it a width.Off the top of my cat's head, make sure the div you're trying to center is not set to width: 100%.If it is, then the rules set on the child divs are what will matter.Please go to this quick example I've created jsFiddle. Hopefull it's easy to understand. You can use a wrapper div with the width of the site to center align. The reason you must put width is that so browser knows you are not going for a liquid layout.It will also work with display:table - a useful display property in this case because it doesn't require a width to be set. (I know this post is 5 years old, but it's still relevant to passers-by ;)Here is my Suggestion:It's perhaps interesting that you do not have to specify width for a <button> element to make it work - just make sure it has display:block : http://jsfiddle.net/muhuyttr/For anybody just now hitting this question, and not being able to fix margin: 0 auto, here's something I discovered you may find useful: a table element with no specified width must have display: table and not display: block in order for margin: auto to do work. This may be obvious to some, as the combination of display: block and the default width value will give a table which expands to fill its container, but if you want the table to take it's "natural" width and be centered, you need display: table

Now if the user decides to scroll up I don't want it to jump back to the bottom until the user scrolls all the way down againIs it possible to have a div that will stay scrolled to the bottom unless the user scrolls up and when the user scrolls back to the bottom it needs to keep itself at the bottom even when new dynamic content is added. How would I go bout creating this.This might help you:[EDIT], to match the comment...whenever content is added, call the function updateScroll(), or set a timer:if you want to update ONLY if the user didn't move:I just implemented this and perhaps you can use my approach.Say we have the following HTML:Then we can check if it scrolled to the bottom with:scrollHeight gives you the height of the element, including any non visible area due to overflow. clientHeight gives you the CSS height or said in another way, the actual height of the element. Both methods returns the height without margin, so you needn't worry about that. scrollTop gives you the position of the vertical scroll. 0 is top and max is the scrollHeight of the element minus the element height itself. When using the scrollbar it can be difficult (it was in Chrome for me) to get the scrollbar all the way down to the bottom. so I threw in a 1px inaccuracy. So isScrolledToBottom will be true even if the scrollbar is 1px from the bottom. You can set this to whatever feels right to you.Then it's simply a matter of setting the scrollTop of the element to the bottom.I have made a fiddle for you to show the concept: http://jsfiddle.net/dotnetCarpenter/KpM5j/EDIT:

Added code snippet to clarify when isScrolledToBottom is true.Stick scrollbar to bottom

I was able to get this working with CSS only.The trick is to use display: flex; and flex-direction: column-reverse;The browser treats the bottom like its the top. Assuming the browsers you're targeting support flex-box, the only caveat is that the markup has to be in reverse order.Here is a working example. https://codepen.io/jimbol/pen/YVJzBgLive demo: http://jsfiddle.net/KGfG2/Default overflow is scroll from top to bottom.transform: rotate(180deg) can make it scroll or load dynamic block from bottom to top. https://blog.csdn.net/yeshennet/article/details/88880252This will calculate the ScrollTop Position from the height of #yourDivID using the $(document).height() property so that even if dynamic contents are added to the div the scroller will always be at the bottom position. Hope this helps. But it also has a small bug even if we scroll up and leaves the mouse pointer from the scroller it will automatically come to the bottom position. If somebody could correct that also it will be nice.Here is my version based on dotnetCarpenter's answer. My approach is a pure jQuery and I named the variables to make things a bit clearer.. What is happening is if the content height is greater then the container we scroll the extra distance down to achieve the desired result. Works in IE and chrome..Jim Hall's answer is preferrable because while it indeed does not scroll to the bottom when you're scrolled up, it is also pure CSS.Very much unfortunately however, this is not a stable solution: In chrome (possibly due to the 1-px-issue described by dotnetCarpenter above), scrollTop behaves inaccurately by 1 pixel, even without user interaction (upon element add). You can set scrollTop = scrollHeight - clientHeight, but that will keep the div in position when another element is added, aka the "keep itself at bottom" feature is not working anymore.So, in short, adding a small amount of Javascript (sigh) will fix this and fulfill all requirements:Something like https://codepen.io/anon/pen/pdrLEZ this (example by Coo), and after adding an element to the list, also the following:where 29 is the height of one line.So, when the user scrolls up half a line (if that is even possible?), the Javascript will ignore it and scroll to the bottom. But I guess this is neglectible. And, it fixes the Chrome 1 px thingy.Here's a solution based on a blog post by Ryan Hunt. It depends on the overflow-anchor CSS property, which pins the scrolling position to an element at the bottom of the scrolled content.Note that overflow-anchor doesn't currently work in Safari or Edge, so this solution doesn't currently work in all browsers.Here is how I approached it. My div height is 650px. I decided that if the scroll height is within 150px of the bottom then auto scroll it. Else, leave it for the user.You can use something like this,In 2020, you can use css snap, but before Chrome 81 the layout change will not trigger re-snap, a pure css chat ui works on Chrome 81, also you can check Can I use CSS snap. This demo will snap the last element if visible, scroll to bottom to see the effect.

So if your HTML looks like this:... then that's your ticket.But if your HTML looks like this:Then you want the adjacent selector:Not exactly. The h1.hc-reform > p means "any p exactly one level underneath h1.hc-reform".What you want is h1.hc-reform + p. Of course, that might cause some issues in older versions of Internet Explorer; if you want to make the page compatible with older IEs, you'll be stuck with either adding a class manually to the paragraphs or using some JavaScript (in jQuery, for example, you could do something like $('h1.hc-reform').next('p').addClass('first-paragraph')).More info: http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/selector.html or http://css-tricks.com/child-and-sibling-selectors/

I know I can set a CSS value through JavaScript such as:But, can I get a current specific style value? I've read where I can get the entire style for the element, but I don't want to have to parse the whole string if I don't have to.You can use getComputedStyle().jsFiddle.The element.style property lets you know only the CSS properties that were defined as inline in that element (programmatically, or defined in the style attribute of the element), you should get the computed style.Is not so easy to do it in a cross-browser way, IE has its own way, through the element.currentStyle property, and the DOM Level 2 standard way, implemented by other browsers is through the document.defaultView.getComputedStyle method.The two ways have differences, for example, the IE element.currentStyle property expect that you access the CSS property names composed of two or more words in camelCase (e.g. maxHeight, fontSize, backgroundColor, etc), the standard way expects the properties with the words separated with dashes (e.g. max-height, font-size, background-color, etc).

......Main reference stackoverflowUse the following. It helped me.See also Get Styles.Cross-browser solution to checking CSS values without DOM manipulation:Usage:Sanitized version (forces selector input to lowercase, and allows for use case without leading ".")If you set it programmatically you can just call it like a variable (i.e. document.getElementById('image_1').style.top). Otherwise, you can always use jQuery:If you're into libraries, why not MyLibrary and getStyle.The jQuery css method is misnamed, CSS is just one way of setting styles and doesn't necessarily represent the actual values of an element's style properties.As a matter of safety, you may wish to check that the element exists before you attempt to read from it. If it doesn't exist, your code will throw an exception, which will stop execution on the rest of your JavaScript and potentially display an error message to the user -- not good. You want to be able to fail gracefully.In 2019You can use computedStyleMap()The answer is valid but sometimes you need to check what unit it returns, you can get that without any slice() or substring() string.The cross-browser solution without DOM manipulation given above does not work because it gives the first matching rule, not the last. The last matching rule is the one which applies. Here is a working version:However, this simple search will not work in case of complex selectors.

What is the cleanest way to disable CSS transition effects temporarily?

I have a DOM element with some/all of the following effects applied: I am writing a jQuery plugin that is resizing this element, I need to disable these effects temporarily so I can resize it smoothly. What is the most elegant way of disabling these effects temporarily (and then re-enabling them), given they may be applied from parents or may not be applied at all.  Use this CSS:Plus either this JS (without jQuery)...Or this JS with jQuery...... or equivalent code using whatever other library or framework you're working with.This is actually a fairly subtle problem.First up, you probably want to create a 'notransition' class that you can apply to elements to set their *-transition CSS attributes to none. For instance:(Minor aside - note the lack of an -ms-transition in there. You don't need it. The first version of Internet Explorer to support transitions at all was IE 10, which supported them unprefixed.)But that's just style, and is the easy bit. When you come to try and use this class, you'll run into a trap. The trap is that code like this won't work the way you might naively expect:Naively, you might think that the change in height won't be animated, because it happens while the 'notransition' class is applied. In reality, though, it will be animated, at least in all modern browsers I've tried. The problem is that the browser is caching the styling changes that it needs to make until the JavaScript has finished executing, and then making all the changes in a single reflow. As a result, it does a reflow where there is no net change to whether or not transitions are enabled, but there is a net change to the height. Consequently, it animates the height change.You might think a reasonable and clean way to get around this would be to wrap the removal of the 'notransition' class in a 1ms timeout, like this:but this doesn't reliably work either. I wasn't able to make the above code break in WebKit browsers, but on Firefox (on both slow and fast machines) you'll sometimes (seemingly at random) get the same behaviour as using the naive approach. I guess the reason for this is that it's possible for the JavaScript execution to be slow enough that the timeout function is waiting to execute by the time the browser is idle and would otherwise be thinking about doing an opportunistic reflow, and if that scenario happens, Firefox executes the queued function before the reflow.The only solution I've found to the problem is to force a reflow of the element, flushing the CSS changes made to it, before removing the 'notransition' class. There are various ways to do this - see here for some. The closest thing there is to a 'standard' way of doing this is to read the offsetHeight property of the element.One solution that actually works, then, isHere's a JS fiddle that illustrates the three possible approaches I've described here (both the one successful approach and the two unsuccessful ones):

http://jsfiddle.net/2uVAA/131/Add an additional CSS class that blocks the transition, and then remove it to return to the previous state. This make both CSS and JQuery code short, simple and well understandable.CSS:!important was added to be sure that this rule will have more "weight", because ID is normally more specific than class.JQuery:I would advocate disabling animation as suggested by DaneSoul, but making the switch global:.notransition can be then applied to the body element, effectively overriding any transition animation on the page:For a pure JS solution (no CSS classes), just set the transition to 'none'. To restore the transition as specified in the CSS, set the transition to an empty string.If you're using vendor prefixes, you'll need to set those too.You can disable animation, transition, trasforms for all of element in page with this css codeI think you could create a separate css class that you can use in these cases:Then in jQuery you would toggle the class like so:If you want to remove CSS transitions, transformations and animations from the current webpage you can just execute this little script I wrote (inside your browsers console):It uses vanillaJS to load this css-file. Heres also a github repo in case you want to use this in the context of a scraper (Ruby-Selenium): remove-CSS-animations-repodoes in your js kill it?obviously repeat for each.I'd have a class in your CSS like this:and then in your jQuery:

I really don't need the buttons, because they are useless when you need to write something like a 6~10 digit number anyway.Is it possible to disable this with CSS or jQuery?According to this blog post, you need to set -moz-appearance:textfield; on the input.It's worth pointing out that the default value of -moz-appearance on these elements is number-input in Firefox.If you want to hide the spinner by default, you can set -moz-appearance: textfield initially, and if you want the spinner to appear on :hover/:focus, you can overwrite the previous styling with -moz-appearance: number-input.I thought someone might find that helpful since I recently had to do this in attempts to improve consistency between Chrome/FF (since this is the way number inputs behave by default in Chrome).If you want to see all the available values for -moz-appearance, you can find them here (mdn).In SASS/SCSS style, you can write like this:Definitely this code style can use in PostCSS.Faced the same issue post Firefox update to 29.0.1, this is also listed out here

 I know for Firebug there are many https://stackoverflow.com/search?q=firebug+CSS+changes+saveYou can save your CSS changes from Chrome Dev Tools itself. Chrome now allows you to add local folders to your Workspace. After allowing Chrome access to the folder and adding the folder to the local workspace, you can map a web resource to a local resource.p.s.You may have to open the mapped file(s) and start editing to get Chrome apply the local version (date 201604.12).DevTools tech writer and developer advocate here.Starting in Chrome 65, Local Overrides is a new, lightweight way to do this. This is a different feature than Workspaces. When you make a change in DevTools, DevTools saves the change to a modified copy of the file on your computer. When you reload the page, DevTools serves the modified file, rather than the network resource.Workspaces is designed to let you use DevTools as your IDE. It maps your repository code to the network code, using source maps. The real benefit is if you're minifying your code, or using code that needs to get transpiled, like SCSS, then the changes you make in DevTools (usually) get mapped back into your original source code. Overrides, on the other hand, let you modify and save any file on the web. It's a good solution if you just want to quickly experiment with changes, and save those changes across page loads.New versions of Chrome have a feature called workspaces which addresses this issue. You can define which paths on your webserver correspond to which paths on your system, then edit and save with just ctrl-s.See: http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/developertools/revolutions2013/I know it is an old post, but I save it this way :You can also see Local Modifications to see your revisions, very interesting feature.

Also work with scripts.You're looking in the wrong section of "Resources".It's not under "Local Storage", it's under "Frames":The above screenshot shows a diff of the original styles against the new modifications made in the devtools. You can right-click the item in the left pane and save it back to disk.Tincr Chrome extension is easier to install (no need to run node server) AND also comes with LiveReload like functionality out the box! Talk about bi-directional editing! :)Tin.cr WebsiteChrome Web Store LinkAndy's Blog ArticleNow that Chrome 18 was released last week with the required APIs, I published my chrome extension in the Chrome web store. The extension automatically saves changes in CSS or JS in Developer tools into the local disk. Go check it out.FYI, If you're using inline styles or modifying the DOM directly (for instance adding an element), workspaces don't solve this problem. That's because the DOM is living in memory and there's not an actual file associated with the active state of the DOM.For that, I like to take a "before" and "after" snapshot of the dom from the console: 

copy(document.getElementsByTagName('html')[0].outerHTML)Then I place it in a diff tool to see my changes.Full article: https://medium.com/@theroccob/get-code-out-of-chrome-devtools-and-into-your-editor-defaf5651b4aTo answer the last part of your question about any extensions that can save changes, there is hotfixIt allows you to save changes from Chrome Dev Tools directly to GitHub. From there you can set up a post-receive hook on GitHub to automatically update your website. You can just right-click on your HTML element, click Edit as HTML and then copy and paste the HTML with the inline styles.UPDATE 2019: As other answers are bit outdated, I'll add updated one here. In latest version there's no need to map the chrome folder to filesystem.So, suppose I have a web folder containing HTML,CSS,JS files in desktop which i want to be updated when I make changes in chrome:=1) You'd need a running local server like node etc, alternatively this vscode extension creates the server for you: live server VSCode extension, install it, run the server.2) load the html page in chrome from running local server.3) Open devTools->Sources->Filesystem->Add folder to workspace4) Add the folder which is used in running local server. No additional mapping is required in latest chrome! Ta-da!More on it Edit Files With WorkspacesNote that the changes made on the styles tab will NOT reflect on the filesystem files.

Instead you need to go to devtools->source->your_folder and then make your changes there and reload the page to see the effect.

I have one div (with id='a') which I don't want it to have the background image.

What css rule do I have to give it?Try:Although the "!important" might not be necessary, because "div#a" has a higher specificity than just "div".I use a transparent spacer image in addition to the rule to remove the background image because IE6 seems to ignore the background-image: none even though it is marked !important.Since in css3 one might set multiple background images setting "none" will only create a new layer and hide nothing.http://www.css3.info/preview/multiple-backgrounds/

http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-background/#backgroundsI have not found a solution yet...for older browsers.. if you have defined css in some framewokrk.css like select2.css in IE9 background-image: -webkit-gradient etc. and you want it via another .css rewrite with "background-image: none !important" not works. I used same color to color gradient like page background color.If your div rule is just div {...}, then #a {...} will be sufficient.  If it is more complicated, you need a "more specific" selector, as defined by the CSS specification on specificity.  (#a being more specific than div is just single aspect in the algorithm.)When background-image: none !important; have no effect.

Obviously automatically through bootstrap the div sizes would become 450px each to compensate for the spaceYou can achieve spacing between columns using the col-md-offset-* classes, documented here. The spacing is consistent so that all of your columns line up correctly. To get even spacing and column size I would do the following:I was facing the same issue; and the following worked well for me. Hope this helps someone landing here:This will automatically render some space between the 2 divs. I know I'm late to the party, but you could try spacing the boxes with padding.CSS:Have a go at ityou can use background-clip and box-model with border propretyI have had similar issues with space between columns. The root problem is that columns in bootstrap 3 and 4 use padding instead of margin. So background colors for two adjacent columns touch each other.I found a solution that fit our problem and will most likely work for most people trying to space columns and maintain the same gutter widths as the rest of the grid system.This was the end result we were going forHaving the gap with a drop shadow between columns was problematic. We did not want extra space between columns. We just wanted the gutters to be "transparent" so the background color of the site would appear between two white columns.this is the markup for the two columnsCSSThis approach does require an inner div with negative margins just like the "row" class bootstrap uses. And this div, we called it "raised-block", must be the direct sibling of a columnThis way you still get proper padding inside your columns. I have seen solutions that appear to work by creating space, but unfortunately the columns they create have extra padding on either side of the row so it ends up making the row thinner that the grid layout was designed for. If you look at the image for the desired look, this would mean the two columns together would be smaller than the one larger one on top which breaks the natural structure of the grid.The major drawback to this approach is that it requires extra markup wrapping the content of each columns. For us this works because only specific columns needed space between them to achieve the desired look.This will allow a space between the two columns and obviously if you want to change the default width you can go for mixins to modify the default bootstrap width. Or, you can give the width using the inline CSS style.You can achieve spacing between columns using the col-xs-* classes,within in a  col-xs-* div coded below. The spacing is consistent so that all of your columns line up correctly. To get even spacing and column size I would do the following:Use bootstrap's .form-group class. Like this in your case:Inside the col-md-?, create another div and put picture in that div, than you can easily add padding like so.Bootstrap 4, file custom.scss you can add following code:by default $grid-gutter-width-base: 30px;I had to figure out how to do this for 3 columns.  I wanted to round the corners of the divs and couldn't get the spacing to work.  I used margins.  In my case I figured for 90% of the screen to be filled in by the divs and 10% for margins:html:and CSS: To make it resize correctly for mobile devices, I had the CSS change the width from 30% to width:92.5%; under @media (max-width:1023px)Since you're using bootstrap, I guess you want to make the thing responsive. In that case you should'n use fixed sizes, in 'px' for example.As a workaround to other solutions, I propose make both columns "col-md-5" instead of "col-md-6", and then in the parent element "row" that contains the columns, add the class "justify-content-between", which puts the free space in the middle, as you can check in the bootstrap doc here This solution is also valid for more than two columns adjusting the "col-md-x" of coursehope it helps ;)According to Bootstrap 4 documentation you should give the parent a negative margin mx-n*, and the children a positive padding px-*I know this post is a little dated but I ran in to this same problem. Example of my html.In order to create space between the groups I overrode bootstrap's margin of -15px in my site.css file by reducing the negative margin by 5. Here's what I did...I hope this helps somebody else.I needed one column on mobile and two columns from tablet portrait up, with equal spacing between them in the middle (also without any grid-added padding inside columns). Could be achieved using spacing utilities and omitting the number in col-md:How about just adding a border the same color as the background using css? I'm new to this, so maybe there's a good reason not to, but it looked good when I tried it.it's simple .. you have to add solid border right, left to col-* 

and it should be work ..:)it looks like this : http://i.stack.imgur.com/CF5ZV.pngHTML :CSS :To obtain a particular width of spacing between columns, we have to set up padding in the standard Bootstrap's layout.This will be useful..If use want to increase or decrease further margin in right side of the box then simply edit margin-right property of list-item.sample output Just white border around wrap elementand first+last child no borderThis by default provides some padding inside the outer div the way you seem to need. Moreover you can also modify the padding using custom CSS.Simple WayDocumentation says (here):So the right answer is: set cols' padding-left/right equal to minus your row's margin-left/right. That simple.Demo: https://codepen.io/frouo/pen/OqGaWNBootstrap 4 - Separate columns using nested rows.Using margin-left is the way to go:works perfectlyThis also one way of doing it and its works.

http://www.w3.org/TR/html40/present/styles.htmlType stands for The MIME type of the style sheet.  The only supported value I have ever seen is Text/CSS, which is probably why HTML5 has dropped it.  I imagine they had it for earlier versions to allow future expansion possibilities which never happened.Using HTML5 and not specifying the type, I have run so far into no problems with compatibility even when testing older versions of IE.It's not required, no.The part of the HTML Living Standard you're interested in is The link element, which states:HTML4.01 does not require the type attribute on a <link> tag. According to the specification, the type attribute is a hint to the browser. If the browser does not support the hinted content type, then it can skip fetching it.My understanding is that it's to allow the specification of stylesheets in formats other than text/css.While that has become the dominant (and standard) delivery format for stylesheets for (X)HTML documents, the specification is actually wide enough to allow a variety of different MIME types to be passed, it's just that standard browsers don't implement them.Not relevant to most people, but some systems (at least Microsoft SharePoint 2013) will use this type attribute when working out how to process HTML (e.g. when creating a .master page file).No it just stands for MIME type, it has been deprecated in HTML, We can drop using it without any browser compatibility.

2010-06-07 17:16:35Z

Is there any known way to make the CSS style background-size work in IE?A bit late, but this could also be useful. There is an IE filter, for IE 5.5+, which you can apply:However, this scales the entire image to fit in the allocated area, so if you're using a sprite, this may cause issues.Specification: AlphaImageLoader Filter @microsoftI created jquery.backgroundSize.js: a 1.5K jquery plugin that can be used as a IE8 fallback for "cover" and "contain" values. Have a look at the demo.Thanks to this post, my full css for cross browser happiness is:It's been so long since I've worked on this piece of code, but I'd like to add for more browser compatibility I've appended this to my CSS for more browser compatibility:Even later, but this could be usefull too. There is the jQuery-backstretch-plugin you can use as a polyfill for background-size: cover. I guess it must be possible (and fairly simple) to grab the css-background-url property with jQuery and feed it to the jQuery-backstretch plugin. Good practice would be to test for background-size-support with modernizr and use this plugin as a fallback.The backstretch-plugin was mentioned on SO here.The jQuery-backstretch-plugin-site is here.In similar fashion you could make a jQuery-plugin or script that makes background-size work in your situation (background-size: 100%) and in IE8-. So to answer your question: Yes there is a way but atm there is no plug-and-play solution (ie you have to do some coding yourself).(disclaimer: I didn't examine the backstretch-plugin thoroughly but it seems to do the same as background-size: cover)There is a good polyfill for that: louisremi/background-size-polyfillTo quote the documentation:In IE11 Windows 7 this worked for me,you can use this file

The opposite of visibility: hidden is visibility: visible.  Similarly, is there any opposite for display: none?Many people become confused figuring out how to show an element when it has display: none, since it's not as clear as using the visibility property.I could just use visibility: hidden instead of display: none, but it does not give the same effect, so I am not going with it.

The opposite of visibility: hidden is visibility: visible.  Similarly, is there any opposite for display: none?Many people become confused figuring out how to show an element when it has display: none, since it's not as clear as using the visibility property.I could just use visibility: hidden instead of display: none, but it does not give the same effect, so I am not going with it.display: none doesn’t have a literal opposite like visibility:hidden does.The visibility property decides whether an element is visible or not. It therefore has two states (visible and hidden), which are opposite to each other.The display property, however, decides what layout rules an element will follow. There are several different kinds of rules for how elements will lay themselves out in CSS, so there are several different values  (block, inline, inline-block etc — see the documentation for these values here ).display:none removes an element from the page layout entirely, as if it wasn’t there.All other values for display cause the element to be a part of the page, so in a sense they’re all opposite to display:none.But there isn’t one value that’s the direct converse of display:none - just like there's no one hair style that's the opposite of "bald".A true opposite to display: none there is not (yet).But display: unset is very close and works in most cases.From MDN (Mozilla Developer Network):Note also that display: revert is currently being developed.  See MDN for details.When changing element's display in Javascript, in many cases a suitable option to 'undo' the result of element.style.display = "none" is element.style.display = "". This removes the display declaration from the style attribute, reverting the actual value of display property to the value set in the stylesheet for the document (to the browser default if not redefined elsewhere). But the more reliable approach is to have a class in CSS likeand adding/removing this class name to/from element.className.you can use It works as normal.... Its a small hacking in css ;)I use

display:block;

It works for meLike Paul explains there is no literal opposite of display: none in HTML as each element has a different default display and you can also change the display with a class or inline style etc.However if you use something like jQuery, their show and hide functions behave as if there was an opposite of display none. When you hide, and then show an element again, it will display in exactly the same manner it did before it was hidden. They do this by storing the old value of the display property on hiding of the element so that when you show it again it will display in the same way it did before you hid it.

https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/740e190223d19a114d5373758127285d14d6b71e/src/css.js#L180This means that if you set a div for example to display inline, or inline-block and you hide it and then show it again, it will once again show as display inline or inline-block same as it was beforescript:Notice that the display property of the div will remain constant even after it was hidden (display:none) and shown again.In the case of a printer friendly stylesheet, I use the following:I used this when I needed to print a form containing values and the input fields were difficult to print.  So I added the values wrapped in a span.print_only tag (div.print_only was used elsewhere) and then applied the .no_print class to the input fields.  So on-screen you would see the input fields and when printed, only the values.  If you wanted to get fancy you could use JS to update the values in the span tags when the fields were updated but that wasn't necessary in my case.  Perhaps not the the most elegant solution but it worked for me!You can use display: blockExample : I ran into this challenge when building an app where I wanted a table hidden for certain users but not for others. Initially I set it up as display:none but then display:inline-block for those users who I wanted to see it but I experienced the formatting issues you might expect (columns consolidating or generally messy).The way I worked around it was to show the table first and then do "display:none" for those users who I didn't want to see it. This way, it formatted normally but then disappeared as needed.Bit of a lateral solution but might help someone!visibility:hidden will hide the element but element is their with DOM. And in case of display:none it'll remove the element from the DOM.So you have option for element to either hide or unhide. But once you delete it ( I mean display none) it has not clear opposite value. display have several values like display:block,display:inline, display:inline-block and many other. you can check it out from W3C.The best answer for display: none isorYou can use this display:block; and also add overflow:hidden;The best "opposite" would be to return it to the default value which is:

I used overflow:auto, as it shows all the text both in my Opera and IE browsers.I don't think you can do this with CSS. Instead, at regular 'word lengths' along the string, insert an HTML soft-hyphen:This will display a hyphen at the end of the line, where it wraps, which may or may not be what you want.Note Safari seems to wrap the long string in a <textarea> anyway, unlike Firefox.Use a CSS method to force wrap a string that has no white-spaces. Three methods:1) Use the CSS white-space property. To cover browser inconsistencies, you have to declare it several ways. So just put your looooong string into some block level element (e.g., div, pre, p) and give that element the following css:2)  use the force-wrap mixin from Compass. 3) I was just looking into this as well and I think might also work (but I need to test browser support more completely):Reference: wrapping contentMy way to go (when there is no appropiate way to insert special chars) via CSS:As found here: http://kenneth.io/blog/2012/03/04/word-wrapping-hypernation-using-css/

On the other hand, the HTML attributes of width and height set the size of the coordinate system or 'grid' that the canvas API will use.For example, consider this (jsfiddle):Both have had the same thing drawn on them relative to the internal coordinates of the canvas element. But in the second canvas, the red rectangle will be twice as wide because the canvas as a whole is being stretched across a bigger area by the CSS rules.Note: If the CSS rules for width and/or height aren't specified then the browser will use the HTML attributes to size the element such that 1 unit of these values equals 1px on the page. If these attributes aren't specified then they will default to a width of 300 and a height of 150. The canvas will be stretched if you set the width and height in your CSS. If you want to dynamically manipulate the dimension of the canvas you have to use JavaScript like so:The browser uses the css width and height, but the canvas element scales based on the canvas width and height. In javascript, read the css width and height and set the canvas width and height to that.Shannimal correctionIf you want a dynamic behaviour based on, e.g. CSS media queries, don't use canvas width and height attributes. Use CSS rules and then, before getting the canvas rendering context, assign to width and height attributes the CSS width and height styles:

In Firefox 3 and Google Chrome 8.0 the following works as expected:But it doesn't when the element is <input>:Why is it not working like I expected?With :before and :after you specify which content should be inserted before (or after) the content inside of that element. input elements have no content.E.g. if you write <input type="text">Test</input> (which is wrong) the browser will correct this and put the text after the input element.The only thing you could do is to wrap every input element in a span or div and apply the CSS on these.See the examples in the specification:This is the same reason why it does not work for <br>, <img>, etc. (<textarea> seems to be special).This is not due to input tags not having any content per-se, but that their content is outside the scope of CSS.input elements are a special type called replaced elements, these do not support :pseudo selectors like :before and :after.Note that this is even referred to in the spec:And more explicitly:Something like this works:Then add some floats or positioning to order stuff.fyi <form> supports :before / :after as well, might be of help if you wrap your <input> element with it...

Edit: found a solution for Firefox, editing question to reflect this.Internet Explorer 9 and lower : 

You could use conditional comments to load an IE-specific stylesheet for any version (or combination of versions) that you wanted to specifically target.like below using external stylesheet.However, beginning in version 10, conditional comments are no longer supported in IE.Internet Explorer 10 & 11 :

Create a media query using -ms-high-contrast, in which you place your IE 10 and 11-specific CSS styles. Because -ms-high-contrast is Microsoft-specific (and only available in IE 10+), it will only be parsed in Internet Explorer 10 and greater.Microsoft Edge 12 : Can use the @supports rule

So I want to put borderless tables inside a normal table while keeping inside separation lines for the borderless tables. But it seems that even if I specifically say to not show the borders on a table, it is forced:HTML:CSS:So here, what I want is just the inside borders.The border styling is set on the td elements.html:css:Update: Since Bootstrap 4.1 you can use .table-borderless to remove the border.https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.1/content/tables/#borderless-tableUsing Bootstrap 3.2.0 I had problem with Brett Henderson solution (borders were always there), so I improved it:HTMLCSSsimilar to the rest, but more specific:Don’t add the .table class to your <table> tag. From the Bootstrap docs on tables:Since Bootstrap v4.1 you can add table-borderless to your table, see official documentation:In my CSS:In my directive:I didn't put the 'borderless' for the td element.Tested and it worked!

All the borders and paddings are completely stripped off.I expanded the Bootstrap table styles as Davide Pastore did, but with that method the styles are applied to all child tables as well, and they don't apply to the footer.A better solution would be imitating the core Bootstrap table styles, but with your new class:Then when you use <table class='table table-borderless'> only the specific table with the class will be bordered, not any table in the tree.Try this:Note: What you were doing before was not working because your css code was targeting a table within your .borderless table (which probably didn't exist) I know this is an old thread and that you've picked an answer, but I thought I'd post this as it is relevant for anyone else that is currently looking.There is no reason to create new CSS rules, simply undo the current rules and the borders will disappear.going forward, anything styled withwill show no borders.Use the border- class from Boostrap 4orBe sure to end the class input with the last change you want to do.This one worked for me.The key is you need to add border-top to the <td>I'm late to the game here but FWIW: adding .table-bordered to a .table just wraps the table with a border, albeit by adding a full border to every cell.  But removing .table-bordered still leaves the rule lines.  It's a semantic issue, but in keeping with BS3+ nomenclature I've used this set of overrides:Use hidden instead of none:Most examples seem to be too specific and/or bloated.Here was my trimmed down solution using Bootstrap 4.0.0 (4.1 includes .table-borderless but still alpha)...Similar to many proposed solutions, but minimal bytes 😉Note: Ended up here because I was viewing BS4.1 references and couldn't figure out why .table-borderless was not working with my 4.0 sources (eg: operator error, duh) 💩In some cases, one must also use border-spacing in the table class, like:

I don't understand why you could have div within a div but not a span within a span.Does it have to do with spans being inline?HTML4 specification states that:Span is an inline element, therefore having span inside span is valid.

There's a related question: Can <span> tags have any type of tags inside them? which makes it completely clear.HTML5 specification (including the most current draft of HTML 5.3 dated November 16, 2017) changes terminology, but it's still perfectly valid to place span inside another span.Yes.

Is it possible to use CSS3 transition animation on page load without using Javascript?This is kind of what I want, but on page load:http://rilwis.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/demo/image-slider.htmlWhat I found so farYou can run a CSS animation on page load without using any JavaScript; you just have to use CSS3 Keyframes.Here's a demonstration of a navigation menu sliding into place using CSS3 only:The important parts here are the keyframe animation which we call slideInFromLeft......which basically says "at the start, the header will be off the left hand edge of the screen by its full width and at the end will be in place".The second part is calling that slideInFromLeft animation:Above is the shorthand version but here is the verbose version for clarity:You can do all sorts of interesting things, like sliding in content, or drawing attention to areas.Here's what W3C has to say.Very little Javascript is necessary:Now the CSS:I know the question said "without Javascript", but I think it's worth pointing out that there is an easy solution involving one line of Javascript.It could even be inline Javascript, something like that:That's all the JavaScript that's needed.I think I have found a sort of work around for the OP question - instead of a transition beginning 'on.load' of the page - I found that using an animation for an opacity fade in had the same effect, (I was looking for the same thing as OP). So I wanted to have the body text fade in from white(same as site background) to black text colour on page load - and I've only been coding since Monday so I was looking for an 'on.load' style thing code, but don't know JS yet - so here is my code that worked well for me. And for whatever reason, this doesn't work for .class only #id's(at least not on mine)Hope this helps - as I know this site helps me a lot!Well, this is a tricky one.The answer is "not really".CSS isn't a functional layer. It doesn't have any awareness of what happens or when. It's used simply to add a presentational layer to different "flags" (classes, ids, states).By default, CSS/DOM does not provide any kind of "on load" state for CSS to use. If you wanted/were able to use JavaScript, you'd allocate a class to body or something to activate some CSS.That being said, you can create a hack for that. I'll give an example here, but it may or may not be applicable to your situation.We're operating on the assumption that "close" is "good enough":Here's an excerpt of our CSS stylesheet:We're also on the assumption that modern browsers render progressively, so our last element will render last, and so this CSS will be activated last.Similar to @Rolf's solution, but skip reference to external functions or playing with class.  If opacity is to remain fixed to 1 once loaded, simply use inline script to directly change opacity via style.  For examplewhere CSS sytle "fadein" is defined per @Rolf,defining transition and setting opacity to initial state (i.e. 0)the only catch is that this does not work with SPAN or DIV elements, since they do not have working onload eventstart it with hover of body than It will start when the mouse first moves on the screen, which is mostly within a second after arrival, the problem here is that it will reverse when out of the screen.thats the best thing I can think of: http://jsfiddle.net/faVLX/fullscreen: http://jsfiddle.net/faVLX/embedded/result/Edit see comments below:

This will not work on any touchscreen device because there is no hover, so the user won't see the content unless they tap it. – Rich BradshawOk I have managed to achieve an animation when the page loads using only css transitions (sort of!):I have created 2 css style sheets:

the first is how I want the html styled before the animation... 

and the second is how I want the page to look after the animation has been carried out.I don't fully understand how I have accomplished this but it only works when the two css files (both in the head of my document) are separated by some javascript as follows.I have tested this with Firefox, safari and opera. Sometimes the animation works, sometimes it skips straight to the second css file and sometimes the page appears to be loading but nothing is displayed (perhaps it is just me?)Here is a link to my work-in-progress website: http://www.hankins-design.co.uk/beta2/test/index.htmlMaybe I'm wrong but I thought browsers that do not support css transitions should not have any issues as they should skip straight to the second css file without delay or duration.I am interested to know views on how search engine friendly this method is. With my black hat on I suppose I could fill a page with keywords and apply a 9999s delay on its opacity. I would be interested to know how search engines deal with the transition-delay attribute and whether, using the method above, they would even see the links and information on the page.More importantly I would really like to know why this is not consistent each time the page loads and how I can rectify this!I hope this can generate some views and opinions if nothing else!If anyone else had problems doing two transitions at once, here's what I did. I needed text to come from top to bottom on page load.HTML

HTML

CSS

Don't know why I kept trying to use 2 transition declarations in 1 selector and (not really) thinking it would use both.CSS only with a delay of 3sa few points to take here:Code:Not really, as CSS is applied as soon as possible, but the elements might not be drawn yet. You could guess a delay of 1 or 2 seconds, but this won't look right for most people, depending on the speed of their internet.In addition, if you want to fade something in for instance, it would require CSS that hides the content to be delivered. If the user doesn't have CSS3 transitions then they would never see it.I'd recommend using jQuery (for ease of use + you may wish to add animation for other UAs) and some JS like this: Along with the transitions added in the CSS. This has the advantage of easily allowing the use of animate instead of the second CSS in legacy browsers if required.

Does anyone know the how to change Bootstrap's input:focus? The blue glow that shows up when you click on an input field?

2013-02-11 21:13:23Z

Does anyone know the how to change Bootstrap's input:focus? The blue glow that shows up when you click on an input field?In the end I changed the following css entry in bootstrap.cssYou can use the .form-control selector to match all inputs. For example to change to red:Put it in your custom css file and load it after bootstrap.css. It will apply to all inputs including textarea, select etc...If you are using Bootstrap 3.x, you can now change the color with the new @input-border-focus variable.See the commit for more info and warnings.In _variables.scss update @input-border-focus.To modify the size/other parts of this glow modify the mixins/_forms.scss You can modify the .form-control:focus color without altering the bootstrap style in this way:For Bootstrap v4.0.0 beta release you will need the following added to a stylesheet that overrides Bootstrap (either add in after CDN/local link to bootstrap v4.0.0 beta or add !important to the stylings:Replace the border-color and the rgba on the box-shadow with which ever colour style you'd like*. Here are the changes if you want Chrome to show the platform default "yellow" outline.In Bootstrap 4, if you compile SASS by yourself, you can change the following variables to control the styling of the focus shadow:Note: as of Bootstrap 4.1, the $input-btn-focus-color and $input-btn-focus-box-shadow variables are used only for input elements, but not for buttons. The focus shadow for buttons is hardcoded as box-shadow: 0 0 0 $btn-focus-width rgba($border, .5);, so you can only control the shadow width via the $input-btn-focus-width variable.To disable the blue glow (but you can modify the code to change color, size, etc), add this to your css:Here's a screencapture showing the effect: before and after:

I landed to this thread looking for the way to disable glow altogether. Many answers were overcomplicated for my purpose. For easy solution, I just needed one line of CSS as follows.Add an Id to the body tag. In your own Css (not the bootstrap.css) point to the new body ID and set the class or tag you want to override and the new properties.

Now you can update bootstrap anytime without loosing your changes.html file: css file: See also: best way to override bootstrap cssActually, in Bootstrap 4.0.0-Beta (as of October 2017) the input element isn't referenced by input[type="text"], all Bootstrap 4 properties for the input element are actually form based.So it's using the .form-control:focus styles. The appropriate code for the "on focus" highlighting of an input element is the following:Pretty easy to implement, just change the border-color property.In Bootstrap 3.3.7 you can change the @input-border-focus value in the Forms section of the customizer:

Is such a thing possible using CSS and two inline-block (or whatever) DIV tags instead of using a table?The table version is this (borders added so you can see it):It produces a left column with a FIXED WIDTH (not a percentage width), and a right column that expands to fill THE REMAINING SPACE on the line.  Sounds pretty simple, right?  Furthermore, since nothing is "floated", the parent container's height properly expands to encompass the height of the content.--BEGIN RANT--

I've seen the "clear fix" and "holy grail" implementations for multi-column layouts with fixed-width side column, and they suck and they're complicated.  They reverse the order of elements, they use percentage widths, or they use floats, negative margins, and the relationship between the "left", "right", and "margin" attributes are complex.  Furthermore, the layouts are sub-pixel sensitive so that adding even a single pixel of borders, padding, or margins will break the whole layout, and send entire columns wrapping to the next line.  For example, rounding errors are a problem even if you try to do something simple, like put 4 elements on a line, with each one's width set to 25%.

--END RANT--I've tried using "inline-block" and "white-space:nowrap;", but the problem is I just can't get the 2nd element to fill the remaining space on the line.  Setting the width to something like "width:100%-(LeftColumWidth)px" will work in some cases, but performing a calculation in a width property is not really supported.

How can I relatively position an element, and have it not take up space in the document flow?

How can I relatively position an element, and have it not take up space in the document flow?What you're trying to do sounds like absolute positioning. On the other hand, you can, however, make a pseudo-relative element, by creating a zero-width, zero-height, relatively positioned element, essentially solely for the purpose of creating a reference point for position, and an absolutely positioned element within that:Add a margin equal to the pixels that you moved:ExampleFrom reading up a little, it seems you can absolute position an element as long as the parent element is relatively positioned. That means if you have the CSS:Then the child element won't take up any space in the document flow at all. You can then position it using one of the "left", "bottom", etc, properties. The relative positioning on the parent shouldn't usually affect it because it will be positioned at its original position by default if you don't specify "left", "bottom", etc.http://css-tricks.com/absolute-positioning-inside-relative-positioning/You simply take that element off the document flow by setting position: absolute, and leave it's breaking point move freely with the dynamic flow of content by not specifying the left top right and bottom style properties which will be forcing it to use the relative endpoint of the flow dynamically. This way the absolutely positioned element will follow the document flow while removing itself from taking up the space. No dummy wrappers are needed. For me the given solutions did not worked fine.

I want to see a h3, than text and after that Bootstrap-panels, vertical-synchroneous to this panels i want to see other panels on the right side, I managed this with a height:0 wrapper and after that position:relative;left:100% . @Bekim Bacaj had the perfect answer for me, even though it may not be exactly what the OP was looking for (although his question leaves room for interpretation).  That being said, Bekim didn't provide an example.  The example above sets up an element that...

Can I stop 100% Width Text Boxes from extending beyond their containers?

Lets say I have a text box that I want to fill a whole line. I would give it a style like this:This causes problems because the width is based on the content of the text box. Text boxes have margin, borders, & padding by default, which makes a 100% width text box larger than its container.For example, here on the right:Is there any way to make a text box fill the width of its container without expanding beyond it?Here is some example HTML to show what I mean:If this is run, you can see by looking at the "normal" text box that the "wide" text box is sticking out beyond the container.

Now if you do want the borders, wrap the input in a div, with the borders set on the div (that way you can remove the display:block from the input too). Something like:Edit:

Another option is to, instead of removing the style from the input, compensate for it in the wrapped div:This will give you somewhat different results in different browsers, but they will not overlap the container. The values in the div depend on how large the border is on the input and how much space you want between the input and the border.Yes: by using the CSS3 property ‘box-sizing: border-box’, you can redefine what ‘width’ means to include the external padding and border.Unfortunately because it's CSS3, support isn't very mature, and as the spec process isn't finished yet, it has different temporary names in browsers in the meantime. So:The old-school alternative is simply to put a quantity of ‘padding-right’ on the enclosing <div> or <td> element equal to about how much extra left-and-right padding/border in ‘px’ you think browsers will give the input. (Typically 6px for IE<8.)This solved the problem for me!Without the need for an external div. Just apply it to your given text box.With this property "The width and height properties (and min/max properties) includes content, padding and border, but not the margin"See description of property at w3schools.Hope this helps someone!Just came across this problem myself, and the only solution I could find that worked in all my test browsers (IE6, IE7, Firefox) was the following:The code:Here, the total horizontal overflow for the input element is 6px - 2x(padding + border) - so we set a padding-right for the inner DIV of 6px.box-sizing support is pretty good actually: http://caniuse.com/#search=box-sizingSo unless you target IE7, you should be able to solve this kind of issues using this property. A layer such as sass or less makes it easier to handle prefixed rules like that, btw.Actually, it's because CSS defines 100% relative to the entire width of the container, including its margins, borders, and padding; that means that the space avail. to its contents is some amount smaller than 100%, unless the container has no margins, borders, or padding. This is counter-intuitive and widely regarded by many to be a mistake that we are now stuck with.  It effectively means that % dimensions are no good for anything other than a top level container, and even then, only if it has no margins, borders or padding.Note that the text field's margins, borders, and padding are included in the CSS size specified for it - it's the container's which throw things off.I have tolerably worked around it by using 98%, but that is a less than perfect solution, since the input fields tend to fall further short as the container gets larger.EDIT: I came across this similar question - I've never tried the answer given, and I don't know for sure if it applies to your problem, but it seems like it will.One solution that may work (it works for me) is to apply negative margin at input (textbox)... or fixed width for ie7 or to drop ie7 support.

This results to pixel perfect width.. For me its 7 so i added 3 and 4 but it is still pixel perfect..I had the same problem and i hated to have extra divs for border etc! So here is my solution which seems to work!You should use a ie7 only stylesheet to avoid the starhacks. If you can't use box-sizing:border-box you could try removing the width:100% and putting a very large size attribute in the <input> element, drawback is however you have to modify the html, and can't do it with CSS only:If you don't need to do it dynamically (for example, your form is of a fixed width) you can just set the width of child <input> elements to the width of their container minus any decorations like padding, margin, border, etc.:If you can't use box-sizing (e.g. when you convert HTML to PDF using iText). Try this:CSSHTMLThis works:The first 'width' is a fallback rule for older browsers.Just style the input to offset for the extra padding.  In the following example the padding on the input would be 10px on the left and right for a total padding offset of 20px:

How can I hide the broken image icon? 

Example:

I have an image with error src:The solution must work in all browsers.There is no way for CSS/HTML to know if the image is broken link, so you are going to have to use JavaScript no matter whatBut here is a minimal method for either hiding the image, or replacing the source with a backup. orYou can apply this logic to multiple images at once by doing something like this:For a CSS option see michalzuber's answer below. You can't hide the entire image, but you change how the broken icon looks.Despite what people are saying here, you don't need JavaScript at all, you don't even need CSS!!It's actually very doable and simple with HTML only.  You can even show a default image if an image doesn't load. Here's how...This also works on all browsers, even as far back as IE8 (out of 250,000+ visitors to sites I hosted in September 2015, ZERO people used something worse than IE8, meaning this solution works for literally everything).Step 1: Reference the image as an object instead of an img.  When objects fail they don't show broken icons; they just do nothing.  Starting with IE8, you can use Object and Img tags interchangeably.  You can resize and do all the glorious stuff you can with regular images too.  Don't be afraid of the object tag; it's just a tag, nothing big and bulky gets loaded and it doesn't slow down anything.  You'll just be using the img tag by another name.  A speed test shows they are used identically.Step 2: (Optional, but awesome) Stick a default image inside that object. If the image you want actually loads in the object, the default image won't show.  So for example you could show a list of user avatars, and if someone doesn't have an image on the server yet, it could show the placeholder image... no javascript or CSS required at all, but you get the features of what takes most people JavaScript.Here is the code...... Yes, it's that simple.If you want to implement default images with CSS, you can make it even simpler in your HTML like this......and just add the CSS from this answer -> https://stackoverflow.com/a/32928240/3196360Found a great solution at https://bitsofco.de/styling-broken-images/If you will add alt with text alt="abc" it will show the show corrupt thumbnail, and alt message abcIf you will not add alt it will show the show corrupt thumbnailIf you want to hide the broken one

just add alt="" it will not show corrupt thumbnail and any alt message(without using js)If you want to hide the broken one

just add alt="" & onerror="this.style.display='none'" it will not show corrupt thumbnail and any alt message(with js)4th one is a little dangerous(not exactly)

, if you want to add any image in onerror event, it will not display even if Image exist as style.display is like adding. So, use it when you don't require any alternative image to display.If we give it in CSS, then the item will not display(like image, iframe, div like that). If you want to display image & you want to display totally blank space if error, then you can use, but also be careful this will not take any space. So, you need to keep it in a div may beLink https://jsfiddle.net/02d9yshw/I think the easiest way is to hide the broken image icon by the text-indent property.Obviously it doesn't work if you want to see the "alt" attribute.  in the case you like to keep/need the image as a placeholder, you could change the opacity to 0 with an onerror and some css to set the image size. This way you will not see the broken link, but the page loads as normal.I liked the answer by Nick and was playing around with this solution. Found a cleaner method. Since ::before/::after pseudos don't work on replaced elements like img and object they will only work if the object data (src) is not loaded. It keeps the HTML more clean and will only add the pseudo if the object fails to load.http://codepen.io/anon/pen/xwqJKQIf you need to still have the image container visible due to it being filled in later on and don't want to bother with showing and hiding it you can stick a 1x1 transparent image inside of the src:<img id="active-image" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"/>I used this for this exact purpose. I had an image container that was going to have an image loaded into it via Ajax. Because the image was large and took a bit to load, it required setting a background-image in CSS of a Gif loading bar.However, because the src of the  was empty, the broken image icon still appeared in browsers that use it.Setting the transparent 1x1 Gif fixes this problem simply and effectively with no code additions through CSS or JavaScript.Using CSS only is tough, but you could use CSS's background-image instead of <img> tags...Something like this:HTMLCSSHere is a working fiddle.Note: I added the border in the CSS on the fiddle just to demonstrate where the image would be.Use the object tag. Add alternative text between the tags like this:http://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_object.aspYou can follow this path as a css solutionSince 2005, Mozilla browsers such as Firefox have supported the non-standard :-moz-broken CSS pseudo-class that can accomplish exactly this request:img[alt]::before also works in Firefox 64 (though once upon a time it was img[alt]::after so this is not reliable). I can't get either of those to work in Chrome 71.Missing images will either just display nothing, or display a [ ? ] style box when their source cannot be found. Instead you may want to replace that with a "missing image" graphic that you are sure exists so there is better visual feedback that something is wrong. Or, you might want to hide it entirely. This is possible, because images that a browser can't find fire off an "error" JavaScript event we can watch for.Additionally, you may wish to trigger some kind of Ajax action to send an email to a site admin when this occurs.The trick with img::after is a good stuff, but has at least 2 downsides:I do not know an universal solution without JavaScript, but for Firefox only there is a nice one:A basic and very simple way of doing this without any code required would be to just provide an empty alt statement. The browser will then return the image as blank. It would look just like if the image isn't there.Example:Try it out to see! ;)For future googlers, in 2016 there is a browser safe pure CSS way of hiding empty images using the attribute selector:Edit: I'm back - for future googlers, in 2019 there is a way to style the actual alt text and alt text image in the Shadow Dom, but it only works in developer tools. So you can't use it. Sorry. It would be so nice.

There is no single answer to which letter is widest.  It depends on the font.  So you'll have to do a similar empirical experiment to figure out the answer for your environment.  But the fact is, most fonts follow the same conventions, and capital W will be the widest.Gist with these character widths in a ratio form (W = 100) captured here using this particular example font:https://gist.github.com/imaurer/d330e68e70180c985b380f25e195b90cFurther to Ned Batchelder's awesomely practical answer, because I came here wondering about digits:  0000000000000000000000000000000000000000111111111111111111111111111111111111111122222222222222222222222222222222222222223333333333333333333333333333333333333333444444444444444444444444444444444444444455555555555555555555555555555555555555556666666666666666666666666666666666666666777777777777777777777777777777777777777788888888888888888888888888888888888888889999999999999999999999999999999999999999How about a programmatic solution?I believe the letter W is the widest.Capital "M" is conventionally the widest.Depending on your platform, there might be a way to "getWidth" from a string or DrawText() function somehow with a width property. I would make a simple algortime that utilized the needed font and then ran through the alfabet and stored it in a small config or just calculated it at initialization as a loop from A to Z isnt that hard.It also depends on the font. I did this 1 or 2 years ago with Processing and Helvetica and it is ILJTYFVCPAXUZKHSEDORGNBQMW in order of increasing pixels. The idea is to draw the text on a canvas with the font you are looking at, count the pixels, then sort with a HashMap or Dictionary.Of course, this might not be directly relavant to your use as this calculates pixel area rather than just width. Might be a little overkill too.Arial 30px in Chrome - W wins.A solution to calculate the widths of fonts a bit like the solution posted by xxx was posted by Alex Michael on his blog (which funnily enough linked me here).Summary:Original Post: http://alexmic.net/letter-pixel-count/Code:It will depend on the font. I would create a small program in a programming language you're most comfortable with, where you draw each letter of the alphabet into a n times m sized bitmap. Initialize each pixel with white. Then count the number of white pixels after you've drawn each letter and save that number. The highest number you find is the one you're looking for.EDIT: If you're in fact just interested in which one takes up the largest rectangle (but it looks like you're really after that, not the pixels), you can use various API calls to find the size, but that depends on your programming language. In Java, for example, you would use the FontMetrics class.I know the accepted answer here is W, W is for WIN.However, in this case, W is also for Width. The case study used employed a simple width test to examine pixels, but it was only the width, not the total pixel count. As an easy counter example, the accepted answer assumes that O and Q take up the same amount of pixels, yet they only take up the same amount of space.Thus, W takes up the most space. But, is it all the pixels it's cracked up to be?Let's get some empirical data. I created imgur images from the following B, M and W. I then analyzed their pixel count (see below), here are the results:B : 114 pixelsM : 150 pixelsW : 157 pixelsHere is how I fed them into canvas and analyzed the raw pixel data from the images.Want to know the real longest glyph, not just guessing?

And I'm not just talking about the letters, digits and common symbols (!, @ and so on).  I mean the longest glyph in all the 32,834 characters of UTF-16.

So I started with answer by @N K that had a programmatic solution to it, and made some slight modifications to it:After running this and waiting (and waiting), it gives the output ௌ won.

And there you have it, the longest character in UTF-32!

Note that on some fonts the longest glyph is ﷽, but the other fonts (especially monospace ones) overlap the characters, as with the font that the program takes program account.It depends on the font. Crossed zero for example takes up considerably more than a regular one.But if one could put up a guess, I'd go with X or B.

Making the main scrollbar always visible

What CSS is required to make the browser's vertical scrollbar remain visible when a user visits a web page (when the page hasn't enough content to trigger the scrollbar's activation)?

2009-07-29 19:12:33Z

What CSS is required to make the browser's vertical scrollbar remain visible when a user visits a web page (when the page hasn't enough content to trigger the scrollbar's activation)?This make the scrollbar always visible and only active when needed. Update: If the above does not work the just using this may. Make sure overflow is set to "scroll" not "auto." With that said, in OS X Lion, overflow set to "scroll" behaves more like auto in that scrollbars will still only show when being used. So if any the solutions above don't appear to be working that might be why.This is what you'll need to fix it:You can style it accordingly if you don't like the default.Things have changed in the last years. The answers above are not valid in all cases any more. Apple is pushing disappearing scrollbars everywhere. Safari, Chrome and even Firefox on MacOs (and iOs) only show scrollbars when actually scrolling — I don't know about current Windows/IE. However there are non-standard ways to style scroll bars on Webkit (IE dropped that a long time ago).Is that what you want?Unfortunately, Opera 9.64 seems to ignore that CSS declaration when applied to HTML or BODY, although it works for other block-level elements like DIV.I use this cross browsers solution (note: I always use DOCTYPE declaration in 1st line, I don't know if it works in quirksmode, never tested it).This will always show an ACTIVE vertical scroll bar in every page, vertical scrollbar will be scrollable only of few pixels.When page contents is shorter than browser's visible area (view port) you will still see the vertical scrollbar active, and it will be scrollable only of few pixels.In case you are obsessed with CSS validation (I'm obesessed only with HTML validation) by using this solution your CSS code would also validate for W3C because you are not using non standard CSS attributes like -moz-scrollbars-verticalbody { height:101%; } will "crop" larger pages.Instead, I use:I was able to get this to work by adding it to the body tag. Was nicer for me because I don't have anything on the html element.An alternative approach is to set the width of the html element to 100vw. On many if not most browsers, this negates the effect of scrollbars on the width.Setting height to 101% is my solution to the problem.

You pages will no longer 'flick' when switching between ones that exceed the viewport height and ones that do not.works the best for me

So, the best way would be to create an image next to the input box. If you are looking something inside the box, you can use background image but you may not be able to write a script to clear the box.So, insert and image and write a JavaScript code to clear the textbox.If you want it like Google, then you should know that the "X" isn't actually inside the <input> -- they're next to each other with the outer container styled to appear like the text box.HTML:CSS:Example: http://jsfiddle.net/VTvNX/Something like this??

Jsfiddle DemoHere's a jQuery plugin (and a demo at the end).http://jsfiddle.net/e4qhW/3/I did it mostly to illustrate an example (and a personal challenge). Although upvotes are welcome, the other answers are well handed out on time and deserve their due recognition.Still, in my opinion, it is over-engineered bloat (unless it makes part of a UI library).I have written a simple component using jQuery and bootstrap.

Give it a try: https://github.com/mahpour/bootstrap-input-clear-buttonUsing a jquery plugin I have adapted it to my needs adding customized options and creating a new plugin. You can find it here:

https://github.com/david-dlc-cerezo/jquery-clearFieldAn example of a simple usage:Obtaining something like this:jQuery Mobile now has this built in:Jquery Mobile API TextInput docsYou can do with this commands (without Bootstrap).No need to include CSS or image files. No need to include that whole heavy-artillery jQuery UI library. I wrote a lightweight jQuery plugin that does the magic for you. All you need is jQuery and the plugin. =)Fiddle here: jQuery InputSearch demo.

Add something like...Working FiddleThe best way of doing it is to just trigger bootstraps click event with a hover. This way, it should still remain touch device friendly You can use jQuery's hover function.You just need to add the class open when the mouse enters and remove the class when the mouse leaves the dropdown.Here's my code:An easy way, using jQuery, is this:For CSS it goes crazy when you also click on it. This is the code that I'm using, it also don't change anything for mobile view.In Twitter Bootstrap is not implemented but you can use the this pluginUpdate 1: Sames question hereHover over the nav items to see that they activate on hover.

http://cameronspear.com/demos/twitter-bootstrap-hover-dropdown/#So you have this code:Normally it works on click event, and you want it work on hover event. This is very simple, just use this javascript/jquery code:This works very well and here is the explanation: we have a button, and a menu. When we hover the button we display the menu, and when we mouseout of the button we hide the menu after 100ms. If you wonder why i use that, is because you need time to drag the cursor from the button over the menu. When you are on the menu, the time is reset and you can stay there as many time as you want. When you exit the menu, we will hide the menu instantly without any timeout.I've used this code in many projects, if you encounter any problem using it, feel free to ask me questions.This is what I use to make it dropdown on hover with some jQueryTry this using hover function with fadein fadeout animationsThis will help you make your own hover class for bootstrap:CSS:Margins are set to avoid unwanted close and they are optional.HTML:Don't forget to remove the button attribute data-toggle="dropdown" if you want to remove onclick open, and this also will work when input is append with dropdown.This only hovers the navbar when you are not on a mobile device, because I find that hovering the navigation does not work well on mobile divices:I try other solutions, i'm using bootstrap 3, but dropdown menu closes too quickly to move over itsupposed that you add class="dropdown" to li, i added a timeoutI have published a proper plugin for the dropdown hover functionality, in which you can even define what happens when clicking on the dropdown-toggle element:https://github.com/istvan-ujjmeszaros/bootstrap-dropdown-hoverI had issues with all the previously existing solutions. The simple CSS ones are not using the .open class on the .dropdown, so there will be no feedback on the dropdown toggle element when the dropdown is visible.The js ones are interfering with clicking on .dropdown-toggle, so the dropdown shows up on hover, then hides it when clicking on an opened dropdown, and moving out the mouse will trigger the dropdown to show up again. Some of the js solutions are braking iOS compatibility, some plugins are not working on modern desktop browsers which are supporting the touch events.That's why I made the Bootstrap Dropdown Hover plugin which prevents all these issues by using only the standard Bootstrap javascript API, without any hack.Triggering a click event with a hover has a small error. If mouse-in and then a click creates vice-versa effect. It opens when mouse-out and close when mouse-in. A better solution:html       jquerycodepenThe solution I am proposing detects if its not touch device and that the navbar-toggle (hamburger menu) is not visible and makes the parent menu item revealing submenu on hover and and follow its link on click. Also makes tne margin-top 0 because the gap between the navbar and the menu in some browser will not let you hover to the subitemsBootstrap drop-down Work on hover, and remain close on click by adding property display:block; in css and removing these attributes data-toggle="dropdown" role="button" from button tag

I have a table containing many rows. Some of these rows are class="highlight" and signify a row that needs to be styled differently and highlighted. What I'm trying to do is add some extra spacing before and after these rows so they appear slightly separated from the other rows. I thought I could get this done with margin-top:10px;margin-bottom:10px; but it's not working. Anyone knows how to get this done, or if it could be done? Here's the HTML and I've set the 2nd tr in the tbody to class highlight.

I thought I could get this done with margin-top:10px;margin-bottom:10px; but it's not working. Anyone knows how to get this done, or if it could be done? Here's the HTML and I've set the 2nd tr in the tbody to class highlight.Table rows cannot have margin values. Can you increase the padding? That would work. Otherwise you could insert a <tr class="spacer"></tr> before and after the class="highlighted" rows.The border-spacing property will work for this particular case.Reference.You can't style the <tr>s themselves, but you can give the <td>s inside the "highlight" <tr>s a style, like thisline-height can be the possible solutionI know this is kind of old, but I just got something along the same lines to work.  Couldn't you do this?Hope this helps.First of all, don't try to put a margin to a <tr> or a <td> because it won't work in modern rendering.Although margin doesn't work, padding does work :Warning : This will also push the border further away from the element, if your border is visible, you might want to use solution 2 instead.To keep the border close to the element and mimic the margin, put another <tr> between each of your reel table's <tr> like so :This isn't going to be exactly perfect though I was happy to discover that you can control the horizontal and vertical border-spacing separately:Because margin is ignored on tr, I usually use a workaround, by setting a transparent border-bottom or border-top and setting the background-clip property to padding-box so the background-color does not get painted underneath the border.see a demo here: http://codepen.io/meodai/pen/MJMVNR?editors=1100background-clip is supported in all modern browser. (And IE9+)Alternatively you could use a border-spacing. But this will not work with border-collapse set to collapse.You might try to use CSS transforms for indenting a whole tr:I think this is a valid solution. Seems to work fine in Firefox 16, Chrome 23 and Safari 6 on my OSX. A way to mimic the margin on the row would be to use the pseudo selector to add some spacing on the td.This way anything marked with the highlight class will be separated top and bottom.https://jsfiddle.net/d0zmsrfs/I gave up and inserted a simple jQuery code as below. This will add a tr after every tr, if you have so many trs like me.

Demo: https://jsfiddle.net/acf9sph6/A hack to give the appearance of margins between table rows is to give them a border the same color as the background. This is useful when styling a 3rd party theme where you can't change the html markup. Eg:Here's a neat way I did it:That will add 4px of vertical spacing between each row.  And if you wanted to not get that border on the last child:Reminder that CSS3 pseudo-selectors will only work in IE 8 and below with selectivizr.add a div to the cells that you would like to add some extra spacing:You can create space between table rows by adding an empty row of cells like this...CSS can then be used to target the empty cells like this…NB: This technique is only good if none of your normal cells will be empty/vacant.Even a non-breaking space will do to avoid a cell from being targetted by the CSS rule above.Needless to mention that you can adjust the space's height to whatever you like with the height property included.add this style before the class="highlighted"

padding-bottom and

display is inline-tableAnother possibility is to use a pseudo selector :after or :beforeThat might avoid issues with browser that don't understand the pseudo selectors, plus background-colors are not an issue.The downside is however, that it adds some extra whitespace after the last cell.For what is worth, I took advantage that I was already using bootstrap (4.3), because I needed to add margin, box-shadow and border-radius to my row, something I can't do with tables.On css I added a few lines to mantain the table behavior of bootstrap

Like I said, great in WebKit, not great in Firefox. Apparently, the -moz-appearance: none doesn't get rid of the drop-down item.Any ideas? No, JavaScript is not an optionOkay, I know this question is old, but 2 years down the track and mozilla have done nothing. I've come up with a simple workaround. This essentially strips all formatting of the select box in firefox and wraps a span element around the select box with your custom style, but should only apply to firefox. Say this is your select menu: And lets assume the css class 'css-select' is: In firefox, this would display with the select menu, followed by the ugly firefox select arrow, followed by your nice custom looking one. Not ideal. Now to get this going in firefox, add a span element around with the class 'css-select-moz': Then fix the CSS to hide mozilla's dirty arrow with -moz-appearance:window and throw the custom arrow into the span's class 'css-select-moz', but only get it to display on mozilla, like this: Pretty cool for only stumbling across this bug 3 hours ago (I'm new to webdesign and completely self-taught). However, this community has indirectly provided me with so much help, I thought it was about time I give something back. I have only tested it in firefox (mac) version 18, and then 22 (after I updated). All feedback is welcome. Update: this was fixed in Firefox v35. See the full gist for details.Just figured out how to remove the select arrow from Firefox. The trick is to use a mix of -prefix-appearance, text-indent and text-overflow. It is pure CSS and requires no extra markup.Tested on Windows 8, Ubuntu and Mac, latest versions of Firefox.Live example: http://jsfiddle.net/joaocunha/RUEbp/1/More on the subject: https://gist.github.com/joaocunha/6273016The trick that works for me is to 

make select width more than 100% and apply overflow:hiddenThis is the only way right now to hide dropdown arrow in FF.BTW. if you want beautiful dropdowns use http://harvesthq.github.com/chosen/From firefox's official release notes on V35:So now in order to hide the default arrow - it's as easy as adding the following rules on our select element:DEMOWe've found a simple and decent way to do this. It's cross-browser,degradable, and doesn't break a form post. First set the select box's opacity to 0.this is so you can still click on itThen make div with the same dimensions as the select box. The div should lay under the select box as the background. Use { position: absolute } and z-index to achieve this.Update the div's innerHTML with javascript.  Easypeasy with jQuery:That's it! Just style your div instead of the select box. I haven't tested the above code so you'll probably need tweak it. But hopefully you get the gist. I think this solution beats {-webkit-appearance: none;}. What browsers should do at the very most is dictate interaction with form elements, but definitely not how their initially displayed on the page as that breaks site design. Try this way:Then, you can use a different image as background and place it:There is another way for moz browsers:If you have a defined a width to you select, this property will push the default dropbox button under the select area.It works for me! ;)While not a complete solution I've found that……works to some extent. You can't change the background (-color or -image) but the element can be rendered invisible with color: transparent. Not perfect but it's a start and you don't need to replace the system level element with a js one.I think I found the solution compatible with FF31!!!

Here are two options that are well explained at this link:

http://www.currelis.com/hiding-select-arrow-firefox-30.html

I used option 1: 

Rodrigo-Ludgero posted this fix on Github, including an online demo. I tested this demo on Firefox 31.0 and it appears to be working correctly. Tested on Chrome and IE as well. Here is the html code:and the css:http://jsbin.com/pozomu/4/edit

It works very good for me!Unfortunately for you this is "something fancy". Normally it's not the web authors place to redesign form elements. Many browsers purposely don't let you style them, in order for the user to see the OS controls they are used to. The only way to do this consistently over browsers and operating systems, is use JavaScript and replace the select elements with "DHTML" ones.Following article show three jQuery based plugins that allow you to do that (it is a bit old, but I couldn't find anything current right now)http://www.queness.com/post/204/25-jquery-plugins-that-enhance-and-beautify-html-form-elements#1I am styling the select just likes thisIt works for me in FF, Safari and Chrome in all versions I've tested.In IE I put:Also you can:

       .yourclass::-ms-expand {display: none;

    }

    .yourid::-ms-exapan {display: none;

    }I know this question is a bit old, but since it turns up on google, and this is a "new" solution:appearance: normal Seems to work fine in Firefox for me (version 5 now). but not in Opera and IE8/9As a workaround for Opera and IE9, I used the :before pseudoselector to create a new white box and put that on top of the arrow.Unfortunately, In IE8 this doesn't work. The box is rendered correctly, but the arrow just sticks out anyway... :-/Using select:before works fine in Opera, but not in IE. If I look at the developer tools, I see it is reading the rules correctly, and then just ignores them (they're crossed out). So I use a <span class="selectwrap"> around the actual <select>.You may need to tweak this a bit, but this works for me!Disclaimer:

I'm using this to get a good looking hardcopy of a webpage with forms so I don't need to create a second page. I'm not a 1337 haxx0r who wants red scrollbars, <marquee> tags, and whatnot :-) Please do not apply excessive styling to forms unless you have a very good reason.Use the pointer-events property. The idea here is to overlay an element over the native drop down arrow (to create our custom one) and then disallow pointer events on it. [see this post]Here is a working FIDDLE using this method.Also, in this SO answer I discussed this and another method in greater detail.This works (tested on Firefox 23.0.1):building on the answer by @JoãoCunha, one css style that is usefull for more then one browserFurther to Joao Cunha's answer, this problem is now on Mozilla's ToDo List and is targeted for ver 35.For those desiring, here is a workaround by Todd Parker, referenced on Cunha's blog, that works today:http://jsfiddle.net/xvushd7x/HTML:CSS:Since Firefox 35, "-moz-appearance:none" that you already wrote in your code, finally remove arrow button as desired.It was a bug solved since that version.A lot of Discussions Happening here & there but I don't see some proper solution for this problem. Finally Ended up by writing a small Jquery + CSS code for doing this HACK on IE & Firefox.Calculate Element Width (SELECT Element) using Jquery.

Add a Wrapper Around Select Element and Keep overflow hidden for this element. Make sure that Width of this wrapper is appox. 25px less as that of SELECT Element. This could be easily done with Jquery.

So Now Our Icon is Gone..! and it is time for adding our image icon on SELECT element...!!!

Just add few simple lines for adding background and you are all Done..!!

Make sure to use overflow hidden for outer wrapper,Here is a Sample of Code which was done for Drupal. However could be used for others also by removing few lines of code which is Drupal Specific.Solution works on All Browsers IE, Chrome & Firefox

No need of Adding fixed Widths Hacks Using CSS. It is all being handled Dynamically using JQuery.!More Described at:- http://northwebstudio.com/blogs/1/jquery/remove-drop-down-arrow-html-select-element-using-jquery-and-csstry this cssIts workingThe appearance property from CSS3 does not allow none value. Take a look at the W3C reference. So, what you is trying to do isn't valid (indeed Chrome shouldn't accept too).Then unfortunatelly we really don't have any cross-browser solution to hide that arrow using pure CSS. As pointed, you will need JavaScript.I suggest you to consider using selectBox jQuery plugin. It's very lightweight and nicely done.You could increase the width of the box and move the arrow closer to the left of the arrow. this then allows you to cover the arrow with an empty white div.Have a look: http://jsbin.com/aniyu4/86/editWould you accept minor changes to the html?Something like putting a div tag containing the select tag.Take a look.Or, you can clip the select. Something along the lines of:This should clip 30px of the right side of select box, stripping away the arrow. Now supply a 170px background image and voila, styled selectIt's a huge hack, but -moz-appearance: menulist-text might do the trick.I was having the same issue. It's easy to make it work on FF and Chrome, but on IE (8+ that we need to support) things get complicated. The easiest solution I could find for custom select elements that works "everywhere I tried", including IE8, is using .customSelect()A useful hack for me is to set the (selects) display to inline-flex.  Cuts the arrow right out of my select button.  Without all of the added code.Jordan Young's answer is the best.  But if you can't or don't want to change your HTML, you might consider just removing the custom down arrow served to Chrome, Safari, etc and leaving firefox's default arrow - but without double arrows resulting.  Not ideal, but a good quick fix that doesn't add any HTML and doesn't compromise your custom look in other browsers.CSS:hackity hack ... a solution that works in every browser I've tested (Safari, Firefox, Chrome). Don't have any IEs lying around, so it would be nice if you could test and comment:CSS, with url-encoded image:http://codepen.io/anon/pen/myPEByI'm using the :after-element to cover the ugly arrow. Since select doesn't support :after, i need a wrapper to work with.

Now, if you would click on the arrow, the dropdown won't register it ... unless your browser supports pointer-events: none, which everyone except IE10- does: http://caniuse.com/#feat=pointer-eventsSo for me it's perfect - a nice, clean, low-headache solution, at least compared to all the other options which include javascript.tl;dr:If IE10 (or lower) Users click the arrow, it won't work. Works good enough for me...If you don't mind fiddling with JS, I wrote a small jQuery plugin that helps you do it. With it you don't need to worry about vendor prefixes.Fiddle here:  JS FiddleThe condition is that you have to style the select from scratch (this means setting the background and border), but you probably want to do this anyway. Also since the function substitutes the original select with a div, you will lose any styling done directly on the select selector in your CSS. So give the select element a class and style the class.Supports most modern browsers, if you want to target older browsers, you can try an older version of jQuery, but perhaps have to replace on() with  bind() in the function  (not tested)The other answers didn't seem to work for me, but I found this hack.

This worked for me (July 2014)In my case, I also had a woocommerce input field so I used this Updated my answer to show select rather than input

The div inside another div picture and code below. Because there will be text and images of the parent div. And red div will be the last element of the parent div.This is one wayBut because the inner div is positioned absolutely, you'll always have to worry about other content in the outer div overlapping it (and you'll always have to set fixed heights).If you can do it, it's better to make that inner div the last DOM object in your outer div and have it set to "clear: both".A flexbox way.HTML:CSS:Edit:Source - Flexbox GuideBrowser support for flexbox - CaniuseMake the outer div position="relative" and the inner div position="absolute" and set it's bottom="0".Here is another pure CSS trick, which doesn't affect an elements flow.You may not want absolute positioning because it breaks the reflow: in some circumstances, a better solution is to make the grandparent element display:table; and the parent element display:table-cell;vertical-align:bottom;.  After doing this, you should be able to give the the child elements display:inline-block; and they will automagically flow towards the bottom of the parent.Note : This is by no means the best possible way to do it! Situation :

I had to do the same thign only i was not able to add any extra divs, therefore i was stuck with what i had and rather than removing innerHTML and creating another via javascript almost like 2 renders i needed to have the content at the bottom (animated bar).Solution: 

Given how tired I was at the time its seems normal to even think of such a method however I knew i had a parent DOM element which the bar's height was starting from.Rather than messing with the javascript any further i used a (NOT ALWAYS GOOD IDEA) CSS answer! :)Yes thats correct, instead of positioning the DOM, i turned its parent upside down in css.For my scenario it will work!

I love Twitter Bootstrap 2.0 - I love how it's such a complete library... but I want to make a global modification for a very boxy-not-round site, which is to get rid of all the rounded corners in Bootstrap... That's a lot of CSS to chug through. Is there a global switch, or what would be the best way to find and replace all the rounded's?I set all element's border-radius to "0" like this: As I'm sure I don't want to overwrite this later I just use !important.If you are not compiling your less files just do:In bootstrap 3 if you are compiling it you can now set radius in the variables.less file:In bootstrap 4 if you are compiling it you can disable radius alltogether in the _custom.scss file:Download the source .less files and make the .border-radius() mixin blank.If you are using Bootstrap version < 3...With sass/scssWith lessYou will need to set this variable before importing the bootstrap. This will affect all wells and navbars. UpdateIf you are using Bootstrap 3 baseBorderRadius should be border-radius-baseIf you want to avoid recompiling the all thing, just add .btn {border-radius: 0;} to your CSS.Or define a mixin and include it wherever you want an unrounded button.When using Bootstrap >= 3.0 source files (SASS or LESS) you don't have to get rid of the rounded corners on everything if there is just one element that is bugging you, for example, to just get rid of the rounded corners on the navbar, use:However, if you do want to get rid of the rounded corners on everything, you can do what @adamwong246 mentioned and use:Those two settings are the "root" settings from which the other settings like navbar-border-radius will inherit from unless other values are specified.For a list all variables check out the variables.less or variables.scssThis question is pretty old however it is highly visible on search engines even in Bootstrap 4 related searches. I think it worths to add an answer for disabling the rounded corners, BS4 way.In the _variables.scss there are several global modifiers exists to quickly change the stuff such as enabling or disabling flex gird system, rounded corners, gradients etc. :Rounded corners are enabled by default.If you prefer compiling the Bootstrap 4 using Sass and your very own _custom.scss like me (or using official customizer), overriding the related variable is enough:The code posted above by @BrunoS did not work for me,what i used wasI hope this helps someoneThere is a very easy way to customize Bootstrap:Or you could add this to the html of the element you want to remove the border radius from (this way you wouldn't be removing it from all buttons / elements):You may also want to have a look at FlatStrap. It provides a Metro-Style replacement for the Bootstrap CSS without rounded corners, gradients and drop shadows.With SASS Bootstrap - if you are compiling Bootstrap yourself - you can set all border radius (or more specific) simply to zero:I have create another css file and add the following code

Is there a way to detect whether or not an input has text in it via CSS? I've tried using the :empty pseudo-class, and I've tried using [value=""], neither of which worked. I can't seem to find a single solution to this.I imagine this must be possible, considering we have pseudo-classes for :checked, and :indeterminate, both of which are kind of similar thing. Please note: I'm doing this for a "Stylish" style, which can't utilize JavaScript.Also note, that Stylish is used, client-side, on pages that the user does not control.

Is there a way to detect whether or not an input has text in it via CSS? I've tried using the :empty pseudo-class, and I've tried using [value=""], neither of which worked. I can't seem to find a single solution to this.I imagine this must be possible, considering we have pseudo-classes for :checked, and :indeterminate, both of which are kind of similar thing. Please note: I'm doing this for a "Stylish" style, which can't utilize JavaScript.Also note, that Stylish is used, client-side, on pages that the user does not control.Stylish cannot do this because CSS cannot do this.  CSS has no (pseudo) selectors for <input> value(s). See:The :empty selector refers only to child nodes, not input values.

[value=""] does work; but only for the initial state.  This is because a node's value attribute (that CSS sees), is not the same as the node's value property (Changed by the user or DOM javascript, and submitted as form data).Unless you care only about the initial state, you must use a userscript or Greasemonkey script.  Fortunately this is not hard.  The following script will work in Chrome, or Firefox with Greasemonkey or Scriptish installed, or in any browser that supports userscripts (i.e. most browsers, except IE).See a demo of the limits of CSS plus the javascript solution at this jsBin page.It is possible, with the usual CSS caveats and if the HTML code can be modified. If you add the required attribute to the element, then the element will match :invalid or :valid according to whether the value of the control is empty or not. If the element has no value attribute (or it has value=""), the value of the control is initially empty and becomes nonempty when any character (even a space) is entered.Example:The pseudo-classed :valid and :invalid are defined in Working Draft level CSS documents only, but support is rather widespread in browsers, except that in IE, it came with IE 10.If you would like to make「empty」include values that consist of spaces only, you can add the attribute pattern=.*\S.*.There is (currently) no CSS selector for detecting directly whether an input control has a nonempty value, so we need to do it indirectly, as described above.Generally, CSS selectors refer to markup or, in some cases, to element properties as set with scripting (client-side JavaScript), rather than user actions. For example, :empty matches element with empty content in markup; all input elements are unavoidably empty in this sense. The selector [value=""] tests whether the element has the value attribute in markup and has the empty string as its value. And :checked and :indeterminate are similar things. They are not affected by actual user input.You can use the :placeholder-shown pseudo class. Technically a placeholder is required, but you can use a space instead.and will work :-)edit: http://jsfiddle.net/XwZR2/Basically what everybody is looking for is:LESS:Pure CSS:You can use the placeholder trick as written above w/o required field.The problem with required is that when you wrote something, then deleted it - the input will now always be red as part of the HTML5 spec - then you'll need a CSS as written above to fix/override it.You can simple do thing w/o requiredCSSCode pen:https://codepen.io/arlevi/pen/LBgXjZSimple css:This code is going to apply the given css if the input is filled up.You can style input[type=text] differently depending on whether or not the input has text by styling the placeholder. This is not an official standard at this point but has wide browser support, though with different prefixes:Example: http://fiddlesalad.com/scss/input-placeholder-cssUsing JS and CSS :not pseudoclassThe valid selector will do the trick.Simple Trick with jQuery and CSS Like so:JQuery:CSS:do it on the HTML part like this:The required parameter will require it to have text in the input field in order to be valid.Yes! you can do it with simple basic attribute with value selector.This is not possible with css. To implement this you will have to use JavaScript (e.g. $("#input").val() == "").

A Space between Inline-Block List Items [duplicate]

[A Space between Inline-Block List Items [duplicate]](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5256533/a-space-between-inline-block-list-items)

Why do the inline-block list items have a space in them? No matter how I make my list items into a menu, I always get spaces.

2011-03-10 07:08:23Z

Why do the inline-block list items have a space in them? No matter how I make my list items into a menu, I always get spaces.I have seen this and answered on it before: After further research I have

 discovered that inline-block is a

 whitespace dependent method and

 is dependent on the font setting. In this case 4px is rendered.To avoid this you could run all your

 lis together in one line, or block

 the end tags and begin tags together

 like this:Example here.As mentioned by other answers and comments, the best practice for solving this is to add font-size: 0; to the parent element: This is better for HTML readability (avoiding running the tags together etc). The spacing effect is because of the font's spacing setting, so you must reset it for the inlined elements and set it again for the content within.Solution:You must set parent font size to 0I would add the CSS property of float left as seen below. That gets rid of the extra space.Actually, this is not specific to display:inline-block, but also applies to display:inline. Thus, in addition to David Horák's solution, this also works:Another solution, similar to Gerbus' solution, but this also works with relative font sizing.I had the same problem, when I used a  inline-block on my menu I had the space between each "li" I found a simple solution, I don't remember where I found it, anyway here is what I did.You add a comment sign between  each end of, and start of : "li" 

Then the horizontal space disappear.

Hope that answer to the question 

Thanks just remove the breaks between li's in your html code...

make the li's in one line only..Even if its not inline-block based, this solution might worth consideration (allows nearly same formatting control from upper levels).

im trying to find a css hack for just safari NOT chrome, i know these are both webkit browsers but im having problems with div alignments in chrome and safari, each displays differently.i have been trying to use this but it affects chrome as well, does anyone know of another one that will just apply to safari please?NOTE: Filters and compilers (such as the SASS engine) expect standard 'cross-browser' code -- NOT CSS hacks like these which means they will rewrite, destroy or remove the hacks since that is not what hacks do. This is non-standard code that has been painstakingly crafted to target single browser versions only and cannot work if they are altered. If you wish to use it with those, you must load your chosen CSS hack AFTER any filter or compiler. This may seem like a given but there has been a lot of confusion among people who do not realize that they are undoing a hack by running it through such software which was not designed for this purpose.Safari has changed since version 6.1, as many have noticed.Please note: if you are using Chrome [and now also Firefox] on iOS (at least in iOS versions 6.1 and newer) and you wonder why none of the hacks seem to be separating Chrome from Safari, it is because the iOS version of Chrome is using the Safari engine. It uses Safari hacks not the Chrome ones. More about that here: https://allthingsd.com/20120628/googles-chrome-for-ios-is-more-like-a-chrome-plated-apple/ Firefox for iOS was released in Fall 2015. It also responds to the Safari Hacks, but none of the Firefox ones, same as iOS Chrome.ALSO: If you have tried one or more of the hacks and have trouble getting them to work, please post sample code (better yet a test page) - the hack you are attempting, and what browser(s) (exact version!) you are using as well as the device you are using. Without that additional information, it is impossible for me or anyone else here to assist you.Often it is a simple fix or a missing semicolon. With CSS it is usually that or a problem of which order the code is listed in the style sheets, if not just CSS errors. Please do test the hacks here on the test site. If it works there, that means the hack really is working for your setup, but it is something else that needs to be resolved. People here really do love to help, or at least point you in the right direction.The test site: https://browserstrangeness.bitbucket.io/css_hacks.html#safariAND MIRROR!https://browserstrangeness.github.io/css_hacks.html#safariThat out of the way here are hacks for you to use for more recent versions of Safari. You should try this one first as it covers current Safari versions and is pure-Safari only:This one still works properly with Safari 13 (early-2020):To cover more versions, 6.1 and up, at this time you have to use the next pair of css hacks. The one for 6.1-10.0 to go with one that handles 10.1 and up.So then -- here is one I worked out for Safari 10.1+:The double media query is important here, don't remove it.Try this one if SCSS or other tool set has trouble with the nested media query:This next one works for 6.1-10.0 but not 10.1 (Late March 2017 update)This hack I created over many months of testing and experimentation by combining multiple other hacks. NOTES: like above, the double media query is NOT an accident -- it rules out many older browsers that cannot handle media query nesting. -- The missing space after one of the 'and's is important as well. This is after all, a hack... and the only one that works for 6.1 and all newer Safari versions at this time. Also be aware as listed in the comments below, the hack is non-standard css and must be applied AFTER a filter. Filters such as SASS engines will rewrite/undo or completely remove it outright.As mentioned above, please check my test page to see it working as-is (without modification!)And here is the code:For more 'version specific' Safari CSS, please continue to read below.Slightly modified works for 10.1 (only):One for Safari 10.0:Safari 10.0 (Non-iOS Devices):Safari 9 CSS Hacks:One for Safari 9.0 and up:and a support features query too:One for Safari 9.0-10.0:Safari 9 now includes feature detection so we can use that now...Now to target iOS devices only. As mentioned above, since Chrome on iOS is rooted in Safari, it of course hits that one as well.one for Safari 9.0+ but not iOS devices:And one for Safari 9.0-10.0 but not iOS devices:Below are hacks that separate 6.1-7.0, and 7.1+

These also required a combination of multiple hacks in order to get the right result:Since I have pointed out the way to block iOS devices, here is the modified version of Safari 6.1+ hack that targets non-iOS devices:To use them:Usually [like in this question] the reason people ask about Safari hacks is 

mostly in reference to separating it from Google Chrome (again NOT iOS!)

It may be important to post the alternative: how to target Chrome separately

from Safari as well, so I am providing that for you here in case it is needed.Here are the basics, again check my test page for lots of specific versions of Chrome, but these cover Chrome in general. Chrome is version 45, Dev and Canary versions are up to version 47 at this time.My old media query combo I put on browserhacks still works just for Chrome 29+:An @supports feature query works well for Chrome 29+ as well... a modified version of the one we were using for Chrome 28+ below. Safari 9, the coming Firefox browsers, and the Microsoft Edge browser are not picked up with this one:Previously, Chrome 28 and newer were easy to target. This is one I sent to browserhacks after seeing it included within a block of other CSS code (not originally intended as a CSS hack) and realized what it does, so I extracted the relevant portion for our purposes: [ NOTE: ] This older method below now pics up Safari 9 and the Microsoft Edge browser without the above update. The coming versions of Firefox and Microsoft Edge have added support for multiple -webkit- CSS codes in their programming, and both Edge and Safari 9 have added support for @supports feature detection. Chrome and Firefox included @supports previously.The block of Chrome versions 22-28 (If needed to support older versions) are also possible to target with a twist on my Safari combo hacks I posted above:Like the Safari CSS formatting hacks above, these can be used as follows:So you don't have to search for it in this post, here is my live test page again:https://browserstrangeness.bitbucket.io/css_hacks.html#safari[Or the Mirror]https://browserstrangeness.github.io/css_hacks.html#safariThe test page has many others as well, specifically version-based to further

help you differentiate between Chrome and Safari, and also many hacks for Firefox, Microsoft Edge, and Internet Explorer web browsers.NOTE: If something doesn't work for you, check the test page first, but provide example code and WHICH hack you are attempting for anyone to assist you.There is a way to filter Safari 5+ from Chrome:Sarari OnlyThis hack 100% work only for safari. I've just tested it with success.For those who want to implement a hack for Safari 7.0 and below, but not 7.1 and above -- use:Replace your class in (.myClass)/* Safari only */

.myClass:not(:root:root) { 

    enter code here

}I like to use the following method:By the way, for any of you guys that just need to target Safari on mobiles, just add a media query to this hack:And don't forget to add the .safari_only class to the element you want to target, example:When using this safari-only filter I could target Safari (iOS and Mac), but exclude Chrome (and other browsers):Step 1: use https://modernizr.com/Step 2: use the html class .regions to select only SafariModernizr will add html classes to the DOM based on what the current browser supports.  Safari supports regions http://caniuse.com/#feat=css-regions whereas other browsers do not (yet anyway).  This method is also very effective in selecting different versions of IE.  May the force be with you.hi i ve made this and it worked for meYou can use a media-query hack to select Safari 7+ from other browsers.Disclaimer: This hack also targets old Chrome versions (before July 2013).Note: If iOS-only is sufficient (if you're willing to sacrifice Safari desktop), then this works: This works:I have tested and it worked for meAt the end I use a little JavaScript to achieve it:then in my CSS to target Apple browser engine the selector will be:https://stackoverflow.com/a/17637937/3174065

it is answered here though this method does use some JS. if used, be sure to put the js in the footer, the body has to be fully loaded for this to fire properly, when placed in the head it errors because it fires before the body is loaded.it then adds a .safari class to the body, but only in safari, making targeting the css very easy.It working 100% in safari..i tried

If I could even selectively render certain directories (without including subdirectories) it would make the whole process a lot less rigid.Thanks!I've discovered a way to make it less rigid and future proof by still using the asset pipeline but having the stylesheets grouped. It's not much simpler than your solution, but this solution allows you to automatically add new stylesheets without having to re-edit the whole structure again.What you want to do is use separate manifest files to break things up. First you have to re-organize your app/assets/stylesheets folder:Then you edit the three manifest files:Next you update your application layout file:Lastly, don't forget to include these new manifest files in your config/environments/production.rb:Update:As Max pointed out, if you follow this structure you have to be mindful of image references. You have a few choices:Came across this problem today.Ended up putting all IE specific stylesheets into lib/assets/stylesheets and creating one manifest file per version of IE. Then in application.rb add them to the list of things to precompile :And in your layouts, conditionally include those manifest files and you're good to go!Thats a pretty neat way to do it.  I use conditional classes on html or modernizr.  See this article for a good representation on what does what.

[Grid of responsive squares [closed]](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/20456694/grid-of-responsive-squares)

I'm wondering how I would go about creating a layout with responsive squares. Each square would have vertically and horizontally aligned content. The specific example is displayed below...

2013-12-08 17:44:42Z

I'm wondering how I would go about creating a layout with responsive squares. Each square would have vertically and horizontally aligned content. The specific example is displayed below...You can make responsive grid of squares with verticaly and horizontaly centered content only with CSS. I will explain how in a step by step process but first here are 2 demos of what you can achieve :

Now let's see how to make these fancy responsive squares!The trick for keeping elements square (or whatever other aspect ratio) is to use percent padding-bottom.

Side note: you can use top padding too or top/bottom margin but the background of the element won't display.As top padding is calculated according to the width of the parent element (See MDN for reference), the height of the element will change according to its width. You can now Keep its aspect ratio according to its width.

At this point you can code :HTML :CSSHere is a simple layout example of 3*3 squares grid using the code above.With this technique, you can make any other aspect ratio, here is a table giving the values of bottom padding according to the aspect ratio and a 30% width.As you can't add content directly inside the squares (it would expand their height and squares wouldn't be squares anymore) you need to create child elements (for this example I am using divs) inside them with position: absolute; and put the content inside them. This will take the content out of the flow and keep the size of the square. Don't forget to add position:relative; on the parent divs so the absolute children are positioned/sized relatively to their parent.Let's add some content to our 3x3 grid of squares :HTML :CSS :RESULT <-- with some formatting to make it pretty!

Horizontally :This is pretty easy, you just need to add text-align:center to .content.

RESULTVertical alignmentThis becomes serious! The trick is to use but we can't use display:table; on .square or .content divs because it conflicts with position:absolute; so we need to create two children inside .content divs. Our code will be updated as follow :HTML :CSS :

We have now finished and we can take a look at the result here :editable fiddle hereYou could use vw (view-width) units, which would make the squares responsive according to the width of the screen.A quick mock-up of this would be:The accepted answer is great, however this can be done with flexbox.Here's a grid system written with BEM syntax that allows for 1-10 columns to be displayed per row.If there the last row is incomplete (for example you choose to show 5 cells per row and there are 7 items), the trailing items will be centered horizontally. To control the horizontal alignment of the trailing items, simply change the justify-content property under the .square-grid class.Fiddle: https://jsfiddle.net/patrickberkeley/noLm1r45/3/This is tested in FF and Chrome.I use this solution for responsive boxes of different rations:HTML:CSS:See demo on JSfiddle.net

[How do I disable form fields using CSS?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5963099/how-do-i-disable-form-fields-using-css)

Is it possible to disable form fields using CSS? I of course know about the attribute disabled, but is it possible to specify this in a CSS rule? Something like -The reason I'm asking is that, I have an application where the form fields are autogenerated, and fields are hidden/shown based on some rules (which run in Javascript). Now I want to extend it to support disabling/enabling fields, but the way the rules are written to directly manipulate the style properties of the form fields. So now I have to extend the rule engine to change attributes as well as style of form fields and somehow it seems less than ideal.It's very curious that you have visible and display properties in CSS but not enable/disable. Is there anything like it in the still-under-works HTML5 standard, or even something non-standard (browser specific)?

Is there anything like it in the still-under-works HTML5 standard, or even something non-standard (browser specific)?You can fake the disabled effect using CSS.You might also want to change colors etc.Since the rules are running in JavaScript, why not disable them using javascript (or in my examples case, jQuery)?UPDATEThe attr function is no longer the primary approach to this, as was pointed out in the comments below. This is now done with the prop function.This can be helpful:Update:and if want to disable from tab index you can use it this way:It's very curious that you think that's very curious. You're misunderstanding the purpose of CSS. CSS is not meant to change the behavior of form elements. It's meant to change their style only. Hiding a text field doesn't mean the text field is no longer there or that the browser won't send its data when you submit the form. All it does is hide it from the user's eyes.To actually disable your fields, you must use the disabled attribute in HTML or the disabled DOM property in JavaScript.You can't use CSS to disable Textbox.

solution would be HTML Attribute.The practical solution is to use CSS to actually hide the input.To take this to its natural conclusion, you can write two html inputs for each actual input (one enabled, and one disabled) and then use javascript to control the CSS to show and hide them.first time answering something, and seemingly just a bit late...I agree to do it by javascript, if you're already using it.For a composite structure, like I usually use, I've made a css pseudo after element to block the elements from user interaction, and allow styling without having to manipulate the entire structure.For Example:I can place a disabled class on the wrapping divThis would grey text within the div and make it unusable to the user.My example JSFiddleI am always using: and then applying the css class to the input field: I know this question is quite old but for other users who come across this problem, I suppose the easiest way to disable input is simply by ':disabled'In reality, if you have some script to disable the input dynamically/automatically with javascript or jquery that would automatically disable based on the condition you add.In jQuery for Example:Hope the answer in CSS helps.You cannot do that I'm afraid, but you can do the following in jQuery, if you don't want to add the attributes to the fields. Just place this inside your <head></head> tagIf you are generating the fields in the DOM (with JS), you should do this instead:This can be done for a non-critical purpose by putting an overlay on top of your input element. Here's my example in pure HTML and CSS.https://jsfiddle.net/1tL40L99/There's no way to use CSS for this purpose.

My advice is to include a javascript code where you assign or change the css class applied to the inputs.

I am trying to set a <div> to a certain percentage height in CSS, but it just remains the same size as the content inside it. When I remove the HTML 5 <!DOCTYTPE html> however, it works, the <div> taking up the whole page as desired. I want the page to validate, so what should I do?I have this CSS on the <div>, which has an ID of page:Percentage of what?To set a percentage height, its parent element(*) must have an explicit height. This is fairly self-evident, in that if you leave height as auto, the block will take the height of its content... but if the content itself has a height expressed in terms of percentage of the parent you've made yourself a little Catch 22. The browser gives up and just uses the content height.So the parent of the div must have an explicit height property. Whilst that height can also be a percentage if you want, that just moves the problem up to the next level.If you want to make the div height a percentage of the viewport height, every ancestor of the div, including <html> and <body>, have to have height: 100%, so there is a chain of explicit percentage heights down to the div.(*: or, if the div is positioned, the ‘containing block’, which is the nearest ancestor to also be positioned.)Alternatively, all modern browsers and IE>=9 support new CSS units relative to viewport height (vh) and viewport width (vw):See here for more info.You need to set the height on the <html> and <body> elements as well; otherwise, they will only be large enough to fit the content. For example:bobince's answer will let you know in which cases "height: XX%;" will or won't work.If you want to create an element with a set ratio (height: % of it's own width), the best way to do that is by effectively setting the height using padding-bottom. Example for square:The square container will just be made of padding, and the content will expand to fill the container. Long article from 2009 on this subject: http://alistapart.com/article/creating-intrinsic-ratios-for-videoYou can use 100vw / 100vh.   CSS3 gives us viewport-relative units. 100vw means 100% of the viewport width. 100vh; 100% of the height. In other case to get rid of that defining parent percentage you can usebody{height:100vh}vh stands for viewport heightI think it helpSometimes, you may want to conditionally set the height of a div, such as when the entire content is less than the height of the screen. Setting all parent elements to 100% will cut off content when it is longer than the screen size.So, the way to get around this is to set the min-height:Continue to let the parent elements automatically adjust their height

Then in your main div, subtract the pixel sizes of the header and footer div from 100vh (viewport units).  In css, something like:min-height: calc(100vh - 246px);100vh is full length of the screen, minus the surrounding divs.

By setting min-height and not height, content longer than screen will continue to flow, instead of getting cut off.

I have a row that I am applying a background highlight to on hover. However, as the border adds 1px additional to the element, it makes it 'move'. How would I compensate for the above movement here (without using a background image)?You can make the border transparent. In this way it exists, but is invisible, so it doesn't push anything around:If your elements have a specified height and/or width, you can also use box-sizing:border-box;, as this box model includes padding and border widths into the computed size, example:add margin:-1px; which reduces 1px to each side. or if you need only for side you can do margin-left:-1px etc.Try this it might solve your problem.Css:HTML:See fiddle for output: http://jsfiddle.net/dLDNA/Add a border to the regular item, the same color as the background, so that it cannot be seen. That way the item has a border: 1px whether it is being hovered or not.

How can I define a CSS scrollbar style cross browser? I tested this code, it only works in IE and opera, but failed in Chrome, Safari and Firefox.Scrollbar CSS styles are an oddity invented by Microsoft developers. They are not part of the W3C standard for CSS and therefore most browsers just ignore them.Webkit's support for scrollbars is quite sophisticated. This CSS gives a very minimal scrollbar, with a light grey track and a darker thumb:This answer is a fantastic source of additional information.jScrollPane is a good solution to cross browser scrollbars and degrades nicely. nanoScrollerJS is simply to use. I always use them...Code example from the Documentation,As of IE6 I believe you cannot customize the scroll bar using those properties. The Chris Coyier article linked to above goes into nice detail about the options for webkit proprietary css for customizing the scroll bar.If you really want a cross browser solution that you can fully customize you're going to have to use some JS. Here is a link to a nice plugin for it called FaceScroll: http://www.dynamicdrive.com/dynamicindex11/facescroll/index.htmtry this it's very easy to use and tested on IE and Safari and FF and worked fine and beside no need for many div around it just add id and it will work fine, after you link you Js and Css files.

Why do my list item bullets overlap floating elements

Kamiel Wanrooij

[Why do my list item bullets overlap floating elements](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/710158/why-do-my-list-item-bullets-overlap-floating-elements)

I have an (XHTML Strict) page where I float an image alongside regular paragraphs of text. All goes well, except when a list is used instead of paragraphs. The bullets of the list overlap the floated image.Changing the margin of the list or the list items does not help. The margin is calculated from the left of the page, but the float pushes the list items to the right inside the li itself. So the margin only helps if I make it wider than the image.Floating the list next to the image also works, but I don't know when the list is next to a float. I don't want to float every list in my content just to fix this. Also, floating left messes up the layout when an image is floated to the right instead of left of the list.Setting li { list-style-position: inside } does move the bullets along with the content, but it also causes lines that wrap to start aligned with the bullet, instead of aligned with the line above.The problem is obviously caused by the bullet being rendered outside the box, the float pushing the contents of the box to the right (not the box itself). This is how IE and FF handle the situation, and as far as I know, not wrong according to the spec. The question is, how can I prevent it?

This is how IE and FF handle the situation, and as far as I know, not wrong according to the spec. The question is, how can I prevent it?I have found a solution to this problem. Applying an ul { overflow: hidden; } to the ul ensures that the box itself is pushed aside by the float, instead of the contents of the box.Only IE6 needs an ul { zoom: 1; } in our conditional comments to make sure the ul has layout.Adding an improvement to Glen E. Ivey's solution:http://jsfiddle.net/mblase75/TJELt/I prefer this technique, since it works when the list needs to flow around the floating image, while the overflow: hidden technique will not. However, it's also necessary to add padding-right: 1em to the li to keep them from overflowing their container. This is where the "display" property comes into its own. Set the CSS below to make the list work alongside the floated content.display: table; works alongside floated content (filling the gap) but without hiding content behind it. Much like a table does :-)EDIT: Remember to add a class to isolate which lists you wish to do this for. E.g. "ul.in-content" or more generally ".content ul"Try list-style-position: inside to change the layout of the bullets.At http://archivist.incutio.com/viewlist/css-discuss/106382 I found a suggestion that worked for me:  style the 'li' elements with:Where you replace "1em" with the width of the left padding/margin that your list items would have if the float weren't present.  This works great in my application, even handling the case where the bottom of the float occurs in the middle of the lists--the bullets shift back over to the (local) left margin just right.By adding overflow: auto; to your ul works for me at least.UpdateI've updated my jsfiddle to visualize what's going on. When having the ul beside the floating img, the content of the ul will be pushed by the float, but not the actual container. By adding overflow: auto the whole ul-box will be pushed by the float instead of only the content.The solution is as easy as:A block box with overflow: other than visible establishes a new block formatting context for its contents. W3C recommendation: http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/visuren.html#block-formattingExample:The buttons on my website, which are <li> in disguise, are made like this. Make the viewport (window) of your browser smaller to see the indenting in action.Related answers:Article with examples:You could assign position: relative; left: 10px; to the li. (You may additionally want to give it a margin-right: 10px;, otherwise it might become too wide on the right side.)Or, if you want to use float for the ul -- as suggested by others -- you can probably stop the rest from floating right of the ul by using clear: left on the element that follows the ul.I am using this to solve this problem:Lists next to floated elements cause issues. In my opinion, the best way to prevent these sorts of floating issues is to avoid floating images that intersect with content. It'll also help when you have to support responsive design.A simple design of having centered images between paragraphs will look very attractive and be much easier to support than trying to get too fancy. It's also one step away from a <figure>.Ok, so if you're crazy persistent enough to continue down this path, there are a couple techniques that can be used.The simplest is to make the list use overflow: hidden or overflow: scroll so that the list is essentially shrink wrapped which pulls the padding back to where it's useful:This technique has a few problems though. If the list gets long, it doesn't actually wrap around the image, which pretty much defeats the entire purpose of using float on the image.Ok, so if you're even crazier more persistent and you absolutely must continue down this path, there's another technique that can be used to wrap the list items and maintain bullets.Instead of padding the <ul> and trying to get it to behave nicely with bullets (which it never seems to want to do), take those bullets away from the <ul> and give them to the <li>s. Bullets are dangerous, and the <ul> just isn't responsible enough to handle them properly.This wrapping behavior can do weird things to complex content, so I don't recommend adding it by default. It's much easier to set it up as something that can be opted into rather than something that has to be overridden.Try the following on your UL tag. This should take care of the bullets overlaying your image and you don't have to mess up your left allignment caused by list-position: inside.Struggled with this myself. Best I've managed is the following:The text is not actually indented but the bullet shows.Edited to update based on OP's commentok, then just break it up into 2 divs nested togethertry changing the ul li css toul  {float:left;  background: blue; }After fighting with this interesting issue in several projects, and investigating why it happens, I finally believe I found both: a working and 'responsive' solution.Here is the magic trick, live example: http://jsfiddle.net/superKalo/phabbtnx/Working inside an LMS without access to head of doc, found it easier to go with margin-right: 20px as an inline style for the image. Which I owe to this site.try this:If you want them to go left, just put in a -##px value.or you could do this:and then remove all the styling from the liHow about this? margin-left: auto will cause the element itself to be right aligned.

Set height and width of the element you want - in my it's a background image in a div inside 

    You could try also floating the ul to the left, and define an appropriate width for it, so that it floats next to the image.Something a little like this jsfiddle?I fixed it withAdd display:table;  to ul:

It seems Apple's overlay is more than just a transparency.  Any ideas on how to achieve this effect with CSS and possibly JS?It is possible with CSS3 :Example here => jsfiddlehttp://codepen.io/Edo_B/pen/cLbrtUsing:that's it.I also believe this could be done dynamically for any screen if using canvas to copy the current dom and blurring it.[Edit] 

In the future (mobile) Safari 9 there will be -webkit-backdrop-filter for exactly this. See this pen I made to showcase it.I thought about this for the last 4 weeks and came up with this solution.  Live Demo[Edit]

I wrote a more indepth post on CSS-Tricks  This technique is using CSS Regions so the browser support is not the best at this moment. (http://caniuse.com/#feat=css-regions)The key part of this technique is to split apart content from layout by using CSS Region. First define a .content element with flow-into:content and then use the appropriate structure to blur the header.The layout structure:The two important parts of this layout are .header__background and .phone__content - these are the containers where the content should flow though.  Using CSS Regions it is simple as flow-from:content (.content is flowing into the named region content)Now comes the tricky part. We want to always flow the content through the .header__background because that is the section where the content will be blured. (using webkit-filter:blur(10px);)This is done by transfrom:translateY(-$HeightOfTheHeader) the .content to ensure that the content will always flow though the .header__background. This transform while always hide some content beneath the header. Fixing this is ease addingto accommodate for the transform. This is currently working in:This is sort of possible with FireFox now thanks to the element style attribute.This experimental attribute lets you use any HTML content as a background image. So, to create the background you need three overlays:So, put together:SVG blur filter (works in FX, other browsers could use filter:blur()):CSS blur style:Finally 3 layers:Then to move this around just set the background-position (sample in jQuery but you could use anything):Here it is as a JS Fiddle, FX only.Check out this demo page. 

This demo uses html2canvas for rendering document as an image.http://blurpopup.labs.daum.net/This pen I found the other day seemed to do it beautifully, just a bit of css and 21 lines of javascript. I hadn't heard of the cloneNode js command until I found this, but it totally worked for what I needed for sure.http://codepen.io/rikschennink/pen/zvcgxDetail:

A. Basically it looks at your content div and invokes a cloneNode on it so it creates a duplicate which it then places inside the overflow:hidden header object sitting on top of the page. 

B. Then it simply listens for scrolling so that both images seem to match and blurs the header image... annnnd BAM. Effect achieved. Not really fully do-able in CSS until they get the lil bit of scriptability built into the language.Example is here:http://versie1.com/TEST/ios7/made a quick demo yesterday that actually does what your talking about. http://bit.ly/10clOM9 

this demo does the parallax based on the accelerometer so it works best on an iPhone itself. I basically just copy the content we are overlaying into a fixed position element that gets blurred. note: swipe up to see the panel.(i used horrible css id's but you get the idea)Am not very sure about that, I believe that CSS isn't capable of doing this at the momentHowever Chris Coyier has blogged about an old technique with multiple images to achieve such effect, http://css-tricks.com/blurry-background-effect/Check this one out http://codepen.io/GianlucaGuarini/pen/Hzrhf

Seems like it does the effect without duplication the background image of the element under itself. See texts are blurring also in the example. Vague.jsI've been using svg filters to achieve similar effects for spritesThis might help you!!This Dynamically changes the background just IOS doesHere is my take on this with jQuery. Solution isn't universal, meaning one would have to tweak some of the positions and stuff depending on the actual design.Basically what I did is: on trigger clone/remove the whole background (what should be blurred) to a container with unblurred content (which, optionally, has hidden overflow if it is not full width) and position it correctly. Caveat is that on window resize blurred div will mismatch the original in terms of position, but this could be solved with some on window resize function (honestly I couldn't be bothered with that now).I would really appreciate your opinion on this solution!ThanksHere is the fiddle, not tested in IE.HTMLCSSjQuery

I suggest (as many other have before) to absolutely position the input and throw it off screen.Check out my fiddle.http://jsfiddle.net/mohany2712/vaw8k/adardesign nailed it regarding the file input element being ignored when it is hidden.  I also noticed many people shifting element size to 0, or pushing it out of bounds with positioning and overflow adjustments.  These are all great ideas.

An alternative way that also seems to work perfectly well is to just set the opacity to 0.  Then you can always just set the position to keep it from offsetting other elements as hide does.  It just seems a little unnecessary to shift an element nearly 10K pixels in any direction.Here's a little example for those who want one:Just for the sake of curiosity, you can do something like you want by dynamically creating an upload form and input file, without adding it to the DOM tree:No need to add the uploadForm to the DOM.Correct code:That's on purpose and by design. It's a security issue.Actually, I found out a really easy method for this, which is:This way, your file input field can have the css property display on none and still win the trade :)It is too late to answer but I think this minimal setup work best. I am also looking for the same.//cssjsbinbootstrap file input buttons demoThis is a very old question, but unfortunately this issue is still relevant and requires a solution.The (suprisingly simple) solution I've come up with is to "hide" the actual file input field and wrap it with a LABEL tag (can be based on Bootstrap and HTML5, for enhancement).See here:Example code hereThis way, the real file input field is invisible and all you see is the customized "button" which is actually a modified LABEL element.

When you click on this LABEL element, the window for selecting a file comes up and the file you choose will go into the real file input field.On top of that, you can manipulate the look and behaviour as you wish (for example: get the name of the selected file from the file input file, after selected, and show it somewhere. The LABEL element doesn't do that automatically, of course. I usually just put it inside the LABEL, as its text content).Beware though! The manipulation of the look and behaviour of this is limited to whatever you can imagine and think of.    ;-)  ;-)I managed with a simple $(...).click(); with JQuery 1.6.1or else simplyi had problems with custom client side validation for <input type="file"/> while using a fake button to trigger it and  @Guillaume Bodi's solution worked for me (also with opacity: 0; on chrome) and css style for upload input Try this, it's a hack. the Position:absolute is for Chrome and trigger('change') is for IE.My problem was a little bit different on iOS 7. Turns out FastClick was causing problems. All I had to do was add class="needsclick" to my button.This is probably the best answer, keeping in mind the cross browser issues.CSS:JS:HTML:I think i understand your problem, because i have a similar.

So the tag <label> have the atribute for, you can use this atribute to link your input with type="file".

But if you don't want to activate this using this label because some rule of your layout, you can do like this.Of course you will adapt this for your own purpose and layout, but that's the more easily way i know to make it work!!Based on Guillaume Bodi's answer I did this:which means it's hidden to start with and then displayed for the trigger, then hidden again immediately.

How do I target only Internet Explorer 10 for certain situations like Internet Explorer-specific CSS or Internet Explorer-specific JavaScript code?I tried this, but it doesn't work:Internet Explorer 10 ignores the conditional comments and uses the <html lang="en" class="no-js"> instead of <html class="no-js ie10" lang="en">.Perhaps you can try some jQuery like this:To use this method you must include the jQuery Migrate library because this function was removed from the main jQuery library.Worked out quite fine for me. But surely no replacement for conditional comments!I wouldn't use JavaScript navigator.userAgent or $.browser (which uses navigator.userAgent) since it can be spoofed.To target Internet Explorer 9, 10 and 11 (Note: also the latest Chrome):To target Internet Explorer 10:To target Edge Browser:Sources:I found a solution on this site where someone had a valuable comment:The solution is:ItInternet Explorer 10 does not attempt to read conditional comments anymore. This means it will treat conditional comments just like any other browser would: as regular HTML comments, meant to be ignored entirely. Looking at the markup given in the question as an example, all browsers including IE10 will ignore the comment portions, highlighted gray, entirely. The HTML5 standard makes no mention of conditional comment syntax, and this is exactly why they have chosen to stop supporting it in IE10.Note, however, that conditional compilation in JScript is still supported, as shown in the comments as well as the more recent answers. It's not going away in the final release either, unlike jQuery.browser. And of course, it goes without saying that user-agent sniffing remains as fragile as ever and should never be used under any circumstances.If you really must target IE10, either use conditional compilation which may still see support in the near future, or — if you can help it — use a feature detection library such as Modernizr instead of (or in conjunction with) browser detection. Unless your use case requires noscript or accommodating IE10 on the server side, user-agent sniffing is going to be more of a headache than a viable option.Sounds pretty cumbersome, but remember that as a modern browser that's highly conformant to today's Web standards1, assuming you've written interoperable code that is highly standards-compliant, you shouldn't have to set aside special code for IE10 unless absolutely necessary, i.e. it's supposed to resemble other browsers in terms of behavior and rendering.2 And it sounds far-fetched, given IE's history, but how many times have you expected Firefox or Chrome to behave the same way only to be met with dismay?If you do have a legitimate reason to be targeting certain browsers, by all means sniff them out with the other tools given to you. I'm just saying that you're going to be much more hard-pressed to find such a reason today than what it used to be, and it's really just not something you can rely on.1 Not only IE10, but IE9, and even IE8 which handles most of the mature CSS2.1 standard far better than Chrome, simply because IE8 was so focused on standards compliance (at which time CSS2.1 was already pretty stable with only minor differences from today's recommendation) while Chrome seems to be little more than a half-polished tech demo of cutting-edge pseudo-standards.2 And I may be biased when I say this, but it sure as hell does. If your code works in other browsers but not IE, the odds that it's an issue with your own code rather than IE10 are far better compared to, say, 3 years ago, with previous versions of IE. Again, I may be biased, but let's be honest: aren't you too? Just look at your comments.A good place to start is the IE Standards Support Documentation. Here is how to target IE10 in JavaScript:Here is how to target IE10 in CSS:In case IE11 needs to be filtered or reset via CSS, see another 

question:

How to write a CSS hack for IE 11?Both solutions posted here (with slight modifications) work:orYou include either of the above lines inside of head tag of your html page before your css link. And then in css file you specify your styles having "ie10" class as a parent:And voilà! - other browsers stay intact. And you don't need jQuery. You can see the example how I implemented it here: http://kardash.net.I've written a small, vanilla JavaScript plugin called Layout Engine, which allows you to feature detect IE 10 (and every other browser), in a simple way that cannot be faked, unlike user agent sniffing.It adds the rendering engine name as a class on the html tag and returns a JavaScript object containing the vendor and version (where appropriate)Check out my blog post: http://mattstow.com/layout-engine.html and get the code on GitHub: https://github.com/stowball/Layout-EngineI use this script - it's antiquated, but effective in targeting a separate Internet Explorer 10 style sheet or JavaScript file that is included only if the browser is Internet Explorer 10, the same way you would with conditional comments. No jQuery or other plugin is required.You can use PHP to add a stylesheet for IE 10Like:If you must do this, you can check the user agent string in JavaScript:As other people have mentioned, I'd always recommend feature detection instead.If you want to target IE 10 with Vanilla JavaScript, you might want to try CSS property detection: Instead of msTouchAction you can also use one of these CSS properties, because they are currently only available in IE 10. But this might change in the future.I've put together a test page with all properties on CodePen. clipBoardData is a function that is only available in IE, so if you are seeking to target all IE versions you can useCSS for IE10+ and IE9You could use feature detection to see if browser is IE10 or greater like so:Only true if > IE9Conditionizr (see docs) will add browser CSS classes to your html element, including ie10. With JavaScript:Work for all IE.So change /Trident/g by /Trident/x.0/g where x = 4, 5, 6 or 7 (or maybe 8 for the future).I just wanted to add my version of IE detection. It's based on a snippet found at http://james.padolsey.com/javascript/detect-ie-in-js-using-conditional-comments/ and exteded to also support ie10 and ie11. It detects IE 5 to 11.All you need to do is add it somewhere and then you can always check with a simple condition. The global var isIE will be undefined if it's not an IE, or otherwise it will be the version number. So you can easily add things like if (isIE && isIE < 10) or alike.For me the following code works fine, all conditional comments are working in all IE versions:I'm on windows 8.1, not sure if it's related to ie11 update...Here is how I do custom CSS for Internet Explorer:In my JavaScript file:And then in my CSS file, y define each different style:Check out http://suhasrathod.wordpress.com/2013/04/29/ie10-css-hacks/use babel or typescript for convert this code jsThis answer got me 90% of the way there.

Is it possible to target the line-break <br/> tag with CSS? I would like to have a 1px dashed line every time there is a line-break. I am customising a site with my own CSS and cannot change the set HTML, otherwise I would use some other way. I don't think it is possible but maybe there is a way someone knows about.BR generates a line-break and it is only a line-break. As this element has no content, there are only few styles that make sense to apply on it, like clear or position. You can set BR's border but you won't see it as it has no visual dimension.If you like to visually separate two sentences, then you probably want to use the horizontal ruler which is intended for this goal. Since you cannot change the markup, I'm afraid using only CSS you cannot achieve this.It seems, it has been already discussed on other forums. Extract from Re: Setting the height of a BR element using CSS:I also found a clarification in the CSS 1 specification (no higher level spec mentions it):Grant Wagner's tests show that there is no way to style BR as you can do with other elements. There is also a site online where  you can test the results in your browser.Updatepelms made some further investigations, and pointed out that IE8 (on Win7) and Chrome 2/Safari 4b allows you to style BR somewhat. And indeed, I checked the IE demo page with IE Net Renderer's IE8 engine, and it worked.Update 2

c69 made some further investigations, and it turns out you can style the marker for br quite heavily (though, not cross-browser), yet this will not affect the line-break itself, because it seem to belong to parent container.Try the following, I put it together using Update 2 from another answer with high votes, and it worked perfectly for me:There is one good reason you would need to style a <br> tag.When it is part of code you don't want to (or can't) change and you want this particular <br> not to be displayed.Can save a lot of time and sometimes your day.For the benefit of any future visitors who may have missed my comments:does not work.It has been tested in IE 6, 7 & 8, Firefox 2, 3 & 3.5B4, Safari 3 & 4 for Windows, Opera 9.6 & 10 (alpha) and Google Chrome (version 2) and it didn't work in any of them. If at some point in the future someone finds a browser that does support a border on a <br> element, please feel free to update this list.Also note that I tried a number of other things:Of those, the following does works in Opera 9.6 and 10 (alpha) (thanks porneL!):Not very useful when it is only supported in one browser, but I always find it interesting to see how different browsers implement the specification.I know you can't edit the HTML, but if you can modify the CSS, can you add javascript?if so, you can include jquery, then you could dorenders as below in IE8... not a lot of use in just one browser though.(N.B. I'm using IE 8.0.7100 (on Win7 RC) if that makes any difference)Also,   or,    br { content: "" }gives a dashed line in Chrome 2 / Safari 4b but loses the line break which (unless anyone can come up with a way to reintroduce that) makes it less than useless.e.g.

IE8 test, Chrome/Safari test and another My own tests conclusively show that br tags do not like to be targeted for css.But if you can add style then you can probably also add a scrip tag to the header of the page?

Link to an external .js that does something like this:So in short, it's not optimal, but here is my solution.this seems to solve the problem:BR is an inline element, not a block element.So, you need:Otherwise, browsers that are a little pickier about such things will refuse to apply borders to your BR elements, since inline elements don't have borders, padding, or margins.UPDATED 9/13/2019:The purpose of styling the <br> tag like this is to make a "bigger" line break (i.e., with a bit of extra space between the lines).The "oldbig" class (below) was tested and worked properly in Chrome 66.0.3359.181, Firefox Quantum 60.0.2, Edge 42.17134.1.0 and IE 11.48.17134.0, to style . Unfortunately, it broke in Chrome version 76 and its derivatives (circa August 2019). The symptom is that the extra space between lines is no longer displayed.The "newbig" class is tested and working properly in current versions of Chrome (76.0.3809.132), Opera, Firefox, Edge, IE, Brave, and Palemoon:Here's a demo:This is the result, displayed in Chrome v.76:This will work, but only in IE.  I tested it in IE8. I placed a <br> tag into a <span> tag and was able to use display:none; on the <span> to control when not to use the <br> tag using Media Queries.old question but this is a pretty neat and clean fix, might come in use for people who are still wondering if it's possible :):with this fix you can also remove BRs on websites ( just set the width to 0px )Why not just use the HR tag?  It's made exactly for what you want.  Kinda like trying to make a fork for eating soup when there's a spoon right in front of you on the table.

What I would like to do (not in IE obviously) is:Which would give a text node a margin. (Is that even possible?) How would I get the text node with CSS?Text nodes cannot have margins or any other style applied to them, so anything you need style applied to must be in an element.  If you want some of the text inside of your element to be styled differently, wrap it in a span or div, for example.You cannot target text nodes with CSS. I'm with you; I wish you could... but you can't :(If you don't wrap the text node in a <span> like @Jacob suggests, you could instead give the surrounding element padding as opposed to margin:

In particular, I added some additional control to ensure that there is no shifting of the page content (aka page shift) when the scrollbar is set to hidden.Two Javascript functions lockScroll() and unlockScroll() can be defined, respectively, to lock and unlock the page scroll.where I assumed that the <body> has no initial margin.Notice that, while the above solution works in most of the practical cases, it is not definitive since it needs some further customization for pages that include, for instance, an header with position:fixed. Let's go into this special case with an example. Suppose to havewith Then, one should add the following in functions lockScroll() and unlockScroll():Finally, take care of some possible initial value for the margins or paddings.To turn OFF scrolling try this:to reset:I've written a jQuery plugin to handle this: $.disablescroll. It prevents scrolling from mousewheel, touchmove, and keypress events, such as Page Down.There's a demo here.Usage:You can attach a function to scroll events and prevent its default behaviour.https://jsfiddle.net/22cLw9em/One liner to disable scrolling including middle mouse button.edit: There's no need for jQuery anyway, below same as above in vanilla JS(that means no frameworks, just JavaScript):this.documentElement.scrollTop - standardthis.body.scrollTop - IE compatibilityCan't you just set the body height to 100% and overflow hidden? See http://jsbin.com/ikuma4/13/editThis may or may not work for your purposes, but you can extend jScrollPane to fire other functionality before it does its scrolling. I've only just tested this a little bit, but I can confirm that you can jump in and prevent the scrolling entirely. All I did was:Fire up events.html, and you'll see a normally scrolling box which due to your coding intervention won't scroll.You can control the entire browser's scrollbars this way (see fullpage_scroll.html). So, presumably the next step is to add a call to some other function that goes off and does your anchoring magic, then decides whether to continue with the scroll or not. You've also got API calls to set scrollTop and scrollLeft.If you want more help, post where you get up to!Hope this has helped.I put an answer that might help here:

jQuery simplemodal disable scrollingIt shows how to turn off the scroll bars without shifting the text around.  You can ignore the parts about simplemodal.Somebody posted this code, which has the problem of not retaining the scroll position when restored. The reason is that people tend to apply it to html and body or just the body but it should be applied to html only. This way when restored the scroll position will be kept:To restore:If you just want to disable scrolling with keyboard navigation, you can override keydown event.Try this code:You can cover-up the window with a scrollable div for preventing scrolling of the content on a page.

And, by hiding and showing, you can lock/unlock your scroll.Do something like this:For folks who have centered layouts (via margin:0 auto;), here's a mash-up of the position:fixed solution along with @tfe's proposed solution.Use this solution if you're experiencing page-snapping (due to the scrollbar showing/hiding).…combined with……and finally, the CSS for .modal-noscroll…I would venture to say this is more of a proper fix than any of the other solutions out there, but I haven't tested it that thoroughly yet… :PEdit: please note that I have no clue how badly this might perform (read: blow up) on a touch device.You can also use DOM to do so. Say you have a function you call like this:And that's all there is to it! Hope this helps in addition to all the other answers!This is what I ended up doing:CoffeeScript:Javascript:Not sure if anybody has tried out my solution.

Override body style for content in an iframe

[Override body style for content in an iframe](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6494721/override-body-style-for-content-in-an-iframe)

How can I control the background image and colour of a body element within an iframe? Note, the embedded body element has a class, and the iframe is of a page that is part of my site. The reason I need this is that my site has a black background assigned to the body, and then a white background assigned to divs that contain text. A WYSIWYG editor uses an iframe to embed content when editing, but it doesn't include the div, so the text is very hard to read. The body of the iframe when in the editor has a class that isn't used anywhere else, so I'm assuming this was put there so problems like this could be solved. However, when I apply styles to class.body they don't override the styles applied to body. The weird thing is that the styles do appear in Firebug, so I've no idea what's going on! Thanks UPDATE - I've tried @mikeq's solution of adding a style to the class that is the body's class. This doesn't work when added to the main page's stylesheet, but it does work when added with Firebug. I'm assuming this is because Firebug is applied to all elements on the page whereas the CSS is not applied within iframes. Does this mean that adding the css after window load with JavaScript would work?

A WYSIWYG editor uses an iframe to embed content when editing, but it doesn't include the div, so the text is very hard to read. The body of the iframe when in the editor has a class that isn't used anywhere else, so I'm assuming this was put there so problems like this could be solved. However, when I apply styles to class.body they don't override the styles applied to body. The weird thing is that the styles do appear in Firebug, so I've no idea what's going on! Thanks UPDATE - I've tried @mikeq's solution of adding a style to the class that is the body's class. This doesn't work when added to the main page's stylesheet, but it does work when added with Firebug. I'm assuming this is because Firebug is applied to all elements on the page whereas the CSS is not applied within iframes. Does this mean that adding the css after window load with JavaScript would work? An iframe is a 'hole' in your page that displays another web page inside of it. The contents of the iframe is not in any shape or form part of your parent page.As others have stated, your options are:The below only works if the iframe content is from the same parent domain.The following jquery script works for me.  Tested on Chrome and IE8.  The inner iframe references a page that is on the same domain as the parent page.In this particular case, I am hiding an element with a specific class in the inner iframe.Basically, you just append a 'style' element to the 'head' of the inner iframe.You cannot change the style of a page displayed in an iframe unless you have direct access and therefore ownership of the source html and/or css files.This is to stop XSS (Cross Site Scripting)An iframe has another scope, so you can't access it to style or to change its content with javascript.It's basically "another page".The only thing you can do is to edit its own CSS, because with your global CSS you can't do anything.By using part of SimpleSam5's answer, I achieved this with a few of Tawk's chat iframes (their customization interface is fine but I needed further customizations).In this particular iframe that shows up on mobile devices, I needed to hide the default icon and place one of my background images. I did the following:I do not own any Tawk's domain and this worked for me, thus you may do this even if it's not from the same parent domain (despite Jeremy Becker's comment on Sam's answer).This code uses vanilla JavaScript. It creates a new <style> element. It sets the text content of that element to be a string containing the new CSS. And it appends that element directly to the iframe document's head.If you have control of the page hosting the iframe and the page of the iframe, you can pass a query parameter to the iframe...Here's an example to add a class to the iframe based on whether or not the hosting site is mobile...Adding iFrame:Inside iFrame:I have a blog and I had a lot of trouble finding out how to resize my embedded gist. Post manager only allows you to write text, place images and embed HTML code. Blog layout is responsive itself. It's built with Wix. However, embedded HTML is not. I read a lot about how it's impossible to resize components inside body of generated iFrames. So, here is my suggestion:If you only have one component inside your iFrame, i.e. your gist, you can resize only the gist. Forget about the iFrame.I had problems with viewport, specific layouts to different user agents and this is what solved my problem:The logic is to set gist (or your component) css based on user agent. Make sure to identify your component first, before applying to query selector. Feel free to take a look how responsiveness is working. Perhaps it's changed now, but I have used a separate stylesheet with this element:to successfully style embedded youtube iframes...see the blog posts on this page. give the body of your iframe page an ID (or class if you wish)then, also within the iframe's page, assign a background to that in CSS

My requirement is simple: 2 columns where the right one has a fixed size. Unfortunately I couldn't find a working solution, neither on stackoverflow nor in Google. Each solution described there fails if I implement in my own context. The current solution is:I get the following with above code:Please advise. Many thanks!Remove the float on the left column.At the HTML code, the right column needs to come before the left one.If the right has a float (and a width), and if the left column doesn't have a width and no float, it will be flexible :)Also apply an overflow: hidden and some height (can be auto) to the outer div, so that it surrounds both inner divs.Finally, at the left column, add a width: auto and overflow: hidden, this makes the left column independent from the right one (for example, if you resized the browser window, and the right column touched the left one, without these properties, the left column would run arround the right one, with this properties it remains in its space).Example HTML:CSS:Example here: http://jsfiddle.net/jackJoe/fxWg7/See http://www.alistapart.com/articles/negativemargins/ , this is exactly what you need (example 4 there).Best to avoid placing the right column before the left, simply use a negative right-margin.And be "responsive" by including an @media setting so the right column falls under the left on narrow screens.Simplest and most flexible solution so far it to use table display:HTML, left div comes first, right div comes second ... we read and write left to right, so it won't make any sense to place the divs right to leftCSS:Cases examples:I'd like to suggest a yet-unmentioned solution: use CSS3's calc() to mix % and px units. calc() has excellent support nowadays, and it allows for fast construction of quite complex layouts.Here's a JSFiddle link for the code below. HTML:CSS:And here's another JSFiddle demonstrating this concept applied to a more complex layout. I used SCSS here since its variables allow for flexible and self-descriptive code, but the layout can be easily re-created in pure CSS if having "hard-coded" values is not an issue.This is a generic, HTML source ordered solution where:Fixed/Second Column on RightFixed/Second Column on LeftAlternate solution is to use display: table-cell; which results in equal height columns.Hey, What you can do is apply a fixed width to both the containers and then use another div class where clear:both, like place a the clear div under left and right container.I have simplified it : I have edited jackjoe's answer. The height auto etc not required I think.CSS:HTML:Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet,consectetuer adipiscing elit. Phasellus varius eleifend.

The annoying thing is that i don't have access and privilege to change the HTML and JavaScript code completely.Any ideas?Pointer-events is a Mozilla hack and where it has been implemented in Webkit browsers, you can't expect to see it in IE browsers for another million years. There is however a solution I found:Forwarding Mouse Events Through LayersThis uses a plugin that uses some not well known/understood properties of Javascript to take the mouse event and send it to another element.There is also another Javascript solution here.Update for October 2013: apparently it's coming to IE in v11. Source. Thanks Tim.Here is another solution that is  very easy to implement with 5 lines of code:Example:There's a workaround for IE - use inline SVG and set pointer-events="none" in SVG.

See my answer in How to make Internet Explorer emulate pointer-events:none?It's worth mentioning that specifically for IE, disabled=disabled works for anchor tags:IE treats this as an disabled element and does not trigger click event. However, disabled is not a valid attribute on an anchor tag. Hence this won't work in other browsers. For them pointer-events:none is required in the styling.UPDATE 1: So adding following rule feels like a cross-browser solution to me

UPDATE 2: For further compatibility,  because IE will not form styles for anchor tags with disabled='disabled', so they will still look active. Thus, a:hover{} rule and styling is a good idea:

 Working on Chrome, IE11, and IE8.

Of course, above CSS assumes anchor tags are rendered with disabled="disabled"Here's a small script implementing this feature (inspired by the Shea Frederick blog article that Kyle mentions):Cover the offending elements with an invisible block, using a pseudo element: :before or :afterThus you're click lands on the parent element. No good, if the parent is clickable, but works well otherwise.I spent almost two days on finding the solution for this problem and I found this at last.This uses javascript and jquery.(GitHub) pointer_events_polyfillThis could use a javascript plug-in to be downloaded/copied.

Just copy/download the codes from that site and save it as pointer_events_polyfill.js. Include that javascript to your site.<script src="JS/pointer_events_polyfill.js></script>Add this jquery scripts to your siteAnd don't forget to include your jquery plug-in.It works! I can click elements under the transparent element. I'm using IE 10. I hope this can also work in IE 9 and below.EDIT: Using this solution does not work when you click the textboxes below the transparent element. To solve this problem, I use focus when the user clicks on the textbox.Javascript:JQuery:This lets you type the text into the textbox.I've found another solution to solve this problem. I use jQuery to set the href-attribute to javascript:; (not ' ', or the browser will reload the page) if the browser window width is greater than 1'000px. You need to add an ID to your link. Here's what I'm doing:Maybe it's useful for you.Use OnClientClick = "return false;" You can also just "not" add a url inside the <a> tag, i do this for menus that are <a> tag driven with drop downs as well.  If there is not drop down then i add the url but if there are drop downs with a <ul> <li> list i just remove it.I faced similar issues:If a normal cursor is needed you could add cursor:defaultBest solution:Runs perfectly on all browsers

Changing the child element's CSS when the parent is hovered

First of all, I'm assuming this is too complex for CSS3, but if there's a solution in there somewhere, I'd love to go with that instead.The HTML is pretty straightforward.The child div is set to display:none; by default, but then changes to display:block; when the mouse is hovered over the parent div. The problem is that this markup appears in several places on my site, and I only want the child to be displayed if the mouse is over it's parent, and not if the mouse is over any of the other parents (they all have the same class name and no IDs).I've tried using $(this) and .children() to no avail.

I am working on a Responsive Web Site with CSS Media Queries.Is the following a good organization for devices?

Phone, Ipad (Landscape & Portrait), Desktop and Laptop, Large ScreenWhat are the common media queries break-point values? I am planning to use the following breakpoints:What do you think? I have a few doubts as ??? points.Rather than try to target @media rules at specific devices, it is arguably more practical to base them on your particular layout instead. That is, gradually narrow your desktop browser window and observe the natural breakpoints for your content. It's different for every site. As  long as the design flows well at each browser width, it should work pretty reliably on any screen size (and there are lots and lots of them out there.)I've been using:It keeps things relatively simple and allows you to do something a bit different for phones in portrait mode (a lot of the time I find myself having to change various elements for them).I'm using 4 break points but as ralph.m said each site is unique. 

You should experiment. There are no magic breakpoints due to so many devices, screens, and resolutions.Here is what I use as a template. 

I'm checking the website for each breakpoint on different mobile devices and updating CSS for each element (ul, div, etc.) not displaying correctly for that breakpoint.So far that was working on multiple responsive websites I've made.UPDATEAs per September 2015, I'm using a better one. I find out that these media queries breakpoints match many more devices and desktop screen resolutions.Having all CSS for desktop on style.cssAll media queries on responsive.css: all CSS for responsive menu + media break pointsUpdate 2019: As per Hugo comment below, I removed max-width 1999px because of the new very wide screens.This is from css-tricks linkI can tell you I am using just a single breakpoint at 768 - that is min-width: 768px to serve tablets and desktops, and max-width: 767px to serve phones.I haven't looked back since. It makes the responsive development easy and not a chore, and provides a reasonable experience on all devices at minimal cost to development time without the need to fear a new Android device with a new resolution you haven't factored in.Media Queries for Standard DevicesIn General for Mobile, Tablets, Desktop and Large Screens1. Mobiles 2. Tablets3. Desktops & laptops4. Larger ScreensIn Detail including landscape and portraitReferenceConsider using twitter bootstrap's break points.

with such a massive adoption rate you should be safe...If you go to your google analytics you can see which screen resolutions your visitors to the website use:Audience > Technology > Browser & OS > Screen Resolution ( in the menu above the stats)My site gets about 5,000 visitors a month and the dimensions used for the free version of responsinator.com are pretty accurate summary of my visitors' screen resolutions.This could save you from needing to be too perfectionistic.I always use Desktop first, mobile first doesn't have highest priority does it? IE< 8 will show mobile css.. sometimes some custom sizes. I don't like bootstrap etc.Instead of using pixels should use em or percentage as it is more adaptive and fluid, better not target devices target your content:HTML5 rockrs read, mobile first Your break points look really good. I've tried 768px on Samsung tablets and it goes beyond that, so I really like the 961px.

You don't necessarily need all of them if you use responsive CSS techniques, like % width/max-width for blocks and images (text as well). Keep your code clean and stylesheets logically separated per screen 'media' type config...

I've a very large table on my page. So I decided to put a horizontal scrollbar on the bottom of the table. But I would like this scrollbar to be also on top on the table.What I have in the template is this:Is this possible to do in HTML and CSS only?To simulate a second horizontal scrollbar on top of an element, put a "dummy" div above the element that has horizontal scrolling, just high enough for a scrollbar. Then attach handlers of the "scroll" event for the dummy element and the real element, to get the other element in synch when either scrollbar is moved. The dummy element will look like a second horizontal scrollbar above the real element. For a live example, see this fiddleHere's the code:HTML:CSS:JS:Try using the jquery.doubleScroll plugin :jQuery :CSS :HTML :First of all, great answer, @StanleyH.  If someone is wondering how to make the double scroll container with dynamic width :http://jsfiddle.net/simo/67xSL/Because you might not need JQuery, here is a working Vanilla JS version based on @StanleyH answer:You can use a jQuery plugin that will do the job for you :  The plugin will handle all the logic for you.StanleyH's answer was excellent, but it had one unfortunate bug: clicking the shaded area of the scrollbar no longer jumps to the selection you click.  Instead, what you get is a very small and somewhat annoying increment in the position of the scrollbar.Tested: 4 versions of Firefox (100% affected), 4 versions of Chrome (50% affected).Here's my jsfiddle. You can get around this with by having an on/off (true/false) var that allows only one onScroll() event to trigger at a time:Problem Behavior With Accepted Answer :Actually Desired Behavior :So, just why does this happen? If you run through the code, you'll see that wrapper1 calls wrapper2's scrollLeft, and wrapper2 calls wrapper1's scrollLeft, and repeat this infinitely, so, we have an infinite loop problem.  Or, rather: the continued scrolling of the user conflicts with wrapperx's call of the scrolling, an event conflict occurs, and the end result is no jumping in the scrollbars.Hope this helps someone else out!Based on @StanleyH solution I created an AngularJS directive, demo on jsFiddle.Easy to use:No jQuery required.Linking the scrollers worked, but in the way it's written it creates a loop which makes scrolling slow in most browsers if you click on the part of the lighter scrollbar and hold it (not when dragging the scroller).I fixed it with a flag:As far as I'm aware this isn't possible with HTML and CSS.In vanilla Javascript/Angular you can do this like this:HTML:CSS:Expanding on StanleyH's answer, and trying to find the minimum required, here is what I implemented:JavaScript (called once from somewhere like $(document).ready()):HTML (note that the widths will change the scroll bar length):That's it.a javascript only solution that's based on @HoldOffHunger and @bobince answers.If you are using iscroll.js on webkit browser or mobile browser, you could try:to all angular/nativeJs fans, implementing @simo's answerHTML (no change)CSS (no change, width: 90% is my desing)JS (like onload) or ngAfterViewChecked (all the as are for TypeScript)There is an issue with scroll direction: rtl.

What is the best way to horizontally space Bootstrap buttons?At the moment the buttons are touching: jsfiddle showing the problem: http://jsfiddle.net/hhimanshu/sYLRq/4/Put them inside btn-toolbar or some other container, not btn-group. btn-group joins them together. More info on Bootstrap documentation.Edit: The original question was for Bootstrap 2.x, but the same is still valid for Bootstrap 3 and Bootstrap 4.In Bootstrap 4 you will need to add appropriate margin to your groups using utility classes, such as mx-2.Just put the buttons in a class ( class="btn-toolbar" ) as told by bro Miroslav Popovic.It works awesome.You can use spacing for Bootstrap and no need for any additional CSS. Just add the classes to your buttons. This is for version 4.you should use bootstrap v.4The easiest way in most situations is margin.Where you can do :ORWhat Dragan B suggested is right way to go for Bootstrap 4. I have put one example below. e.g. mr-3 is margin-right:1rem!importantp.s: in my case I wanted my buttons to be displayed to the right of the screen and hence pull-right. I used the Bootstrap 4 buttons plugin (https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/components/buttons/#button-plugin)

and added the class rounded to the labels and the class mx-1 to the middle button to achieve the desired look and feel of separate radio buttons. Using the class btn-toolbar made the radio button circles appear for me which is not what I wanted. Hope this helps someone. Another way to achieve this is to add a class .btn-space in your buttonsand define this class as followsI actual ran into the same requirement. I simply used CSS override like thisif use Bootstrap, you can change with style like: If you want only in one page, then betwen head tags add     .btn-group btn{margin-right:1rem;}If is for all the web site add to css fileI ended up doing something similar to what mark dibe did, but I needed to figure out the spacing for a slightly different manner.The col-x classes in bootstrap can be an absolute lifesaver. I ended up doing something similar to this:This allowed me to align titles and input switches in a nicely spaced manner. The same idea can be applied to the buttons and allow you to stop the buttons from touching.(Side note: I wanted this to be a comment on the above link, but my reputation is not high enough)

In the following code shouldn't the div and the input have identical dimensions?How do I get the input to fill the width? 100% width won't work, because the input has padding and a border (causing a final width of 1 pixel + 5 pixels + 100% + 5 pixels + 1 pixels).

This seems like a CSS quirk and understanding it may be useful later.I should point out I can already do this with wrapper workarounds. Apart from this screwing with the page semantics and CSS selector relationships I'm trying to understand the nature of the problem and whether it can be overcome by changing the nature of the INPUT itself.Ok, this is TRULY strange! I've found that the solution is to simply add max-width:100% to an input with width:100%;padding:5px;. However this raises even more questions (which I'll ask in a separate question), but it seems that width uses the normal CSS box model and max-width uses the Internet Explorer border-box model.

In the process of playing with this, and with much help from the venerable gurus Dean Edwards and Erik Arvidsson, I managed to piece together three separate solutions to make a true cross-browser 100% width on elements with arbitrary padding and borders.

See answer below. This solution does not require any extra HTML markup, just a class (or selector) and an optional behaviour for legacy Internet Explorer.Check out what I came up with, a solution using the relatively unknown box-sizing:border-box style from CSS 3. This allows a 'true' 100% width on any element regardless of that elements' padding and/or borders.This solution supports Internet Explorer 6 and Internet Explorer 7 via a behaviour written by Erik Arvidsson with some tweaks from Dean Edwards to support percentage and other non-pixel widths.Working example

Behaviour (boxsizing.htc)The reason this happens is that a text input's size is determined by its size attribute. add size="50" inside the <input> tag. Then change it to size="100" -- see what I mean?I suspect there's a better solution, but the only one that comes to mind is something I found on the "Hidden features of HTML" question on SO: Use a content-editable div, instead of an input. Passing the user input to the enclosing form (if that's what you need to) might be a little tricky.Hidden features of HTMLYour best bet is to wrap the input in a div with your border, margins, etc., and have the input inside with width 100% and no border, no margins, etc.For example,You could fake it, like this:Try this:Also you could fake it, like this:Add this to your style:

[CSS selector - element with a given child [duplicate]](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4220327/css-selector-element-with-a-given-child)

I'm looking to make a selector which will select all elements if they have a specific child element. For example, select all <div> with a child <span>.Possible?

I'm looking to make a selector which will select all elements if they have a specific child element. For example, select all <div> with a child <span>.Possible?Unfortunately not yet.The CSS2 and CSS3 selector specifications do not allow for any sort of parent selection.This is a disclaimer about the accuracy of this post from this point onward. Parent selectors in CSS have been discussed for many years. As no consensus has been found, changes keep happening. I will attempt to keep this answer up-to-date, however be aware that there may be inaccuracies due to changes in the specifications.An older "Selectors Level 4 Working Draft" described a feature which was the ability to specify the "subject" of a selector. This feature has been dropped and will not be available for CSS implementations.The subject was going to be the element in the selector chain that would have styles applied to it.This selector would style the span elementThis selector would style the p elementA more recent "Selectors Level 4 Editor’s Draft" includes "The Relational Pseudo-class: :has()":has() would allow an author to select an element based on its contents. My understanding is it was chosen to provide compatibility with jQuery's custom :has() pseudo-selector*.In any event, continuing the example from above, to select the p element that contains a span one could use:* This makes me wonder if jQuery had implemented selector subjects whether subjects would have remained in the specification.Update 2019The :has() pseudo-selector is propsed in the CSS Selectors 4 spec, and will address this use case once implemented.To use it, we will write something like:In a structure like:This CSS will target the .bar div - because it both has a parent .foo and from its position in the DOM, > .baz resolves to a valid element target.Original Answer (left for historical purposes) - this portion is no longer accurateFor completeness, I wanted to point out that in the Selectors 4 specification (currently in proposal), this will become possible. Specifically, we will gain Subject Selectors, which will be used in the following format:The ! before the div selector indicates that it is the element to be styled, rather than the span. Unfortunately, no modern browsers (as of the time of this posting) have implemented this as part of their CSS support. There is, however, support via a JavaScript library called Sel, if you want to go down the path of exploration further.I agree that it is not possible in general.The only thing CSS3 can do (which helped in my case) is to select elements that have no children:Or have any children (including text):

I am a beginner at CSS and when I was looking at some CSS code the other day, I found these lines. In the tutorials I used to learn CSS, I have never seen anything like these lines. Could someone please explain these lines to me or give me a source where I could learn to implement lines like these?These are the vendor-prefixed properties offered by the relevant rendering engines (-webkit for Chrome, Safari; -moz for Firefox, -o for Opera, -ms for Internet Explorer). Typically they're used to implement new, or proprietary CSS features, prior to final clarification/definition by the W3.This allows properties to be set specific to each individual browser/rendering engine in order for inconsistencies between implementations to be safely accounted for. The prefixes will, over time, be removed (at least in theory) as the unprefixed, the final version, of the property is implemented in that browser.To that end it's usually considered good practice to specify the vendor-prefixed version first and then the non-prefixed version, in order that the non-prefixed property will override the vendor-prefixed property-settings once it's implemented; for example:Specifically, to address the CSS in your question, the lines you quote:Specify the column-count, column-gap and column-fill properties for Webkit browsers and Firefox.References:What are -moz- and -webkit-?CSS properties starting with -webkit-, -moz-, -ms- or -o- are called vendor prefixes. Why do different browsers add different prefixes for the same effect?  A good explanation of vendor prefixes comes from Peter-Paul Koch of QuirksMode:UPDATE AS OF THE YEAR 2016As this post 3 years old, it's important to mention that now most vendors do understand that these prefixes are just creating un-necessary duplicate code and that the situation where you need to specify 3 different CSS rules to get one effect working in all browser is an unwanted one.As mentioned in this glossary about Mozilla's view on Vendor Prefix on May 3, 2016,For example, just a few years ago, to set a rounded corner on a box you had to write:But now that browsers have come to fully support this feature, you really only need the standardized version:Finding the right rules for all browsersAs still there's no standard for common CSS rules that work on all browsers, you can use tools like caniuse.com to check support of a rule across all major browsers.You can also use pleeease.io/play. Pleeease is a Node.js application that easily processes your CSS. It simplifies the use of preprocessors and combines them with best postprocessors. It helps create clean stylesheets, support older browsers and offers better maintainability. Input:Output:

Here is my complete code:col-xs-* have been dropped in Bootstrap 4 in favor of col-*. Replace col-xs-12 with col-12 and it will work as expected.Also note col-xs-offset-{n} were replaced by offset-{n} in v4.I just wondered, why col-xs-6 did not work for me but then I found the answer in the Bootstrap 4 documentation. The class prefix for extra small devices is now col- while in the previous versions it was col-xs.https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.1/layout/grid/#grid-optionsBootstrap 4 dropped all col-xs-* classes, so use col-* instead. For example col-xs-6 replaced by col-6.you could do this, if you want to use the old syntax (or don't want to rewrite every template)

Just to clarify why to I need this. I'm using multi file upload code from http://www.morningz.com/?p=5 and it doesn't need input text field because it never has value. Script just adds newly selected file to collection on page. It would look much better without text field, if it's possible.

Script just adds newly selected file to collection on page. It would look much better without text field, if it's possible.This will surely work i have used it in my projects.I hope this helps :)I was having a heck of a time trying to accomplish this. I didn't want to use a Flash solution, and none of the jQuery libraries I looked at were reliable across all browsers.I came up with my own solution, which is implemented completely in CSS (except for the onclick style change to make the button appear 'clicked').You can try a working example here: http://jsfiddle.net/VQJ9V/307/ (Tested in FF 7, IE 9, Safari 5, Opera 11 and Chrome 14)It works by creating a big file input (with font-size:50px), then wrapping it in a div that has a fixed size and overflow:hidden. The input is then only visible through this "window" div. The div can be given a background image or color, text can be added, and the input can be made transparent to reveal the div background:HTML:CSS:Let me know if there are any problems with it and I'll try to fix them.I wasted my day today getting this to work. I found none of the solutions here working each of my scenarios. Then I remembered I saw an example for the JQuery File Upload without text box. So what I did is that I took their example and stripped it down to the relevant part.This solution at least works for IE and FF and can be fully styled. In the below example the file input is hidden under the fancy "Add Files" button.Hide the input-file element and create a visible button that will trigger the click event of that input-file.Try this:CSSHTML:JAVASCRIPT(jQuery):Hide the input file tag with css, add a label and assign it to input button. label will be clickable and when clicked, it will fire up the file dialog.Add the style to the label as a button.

Live DemoThat's going to be very hard. The problem with the file input type is that it usually consists of two visual elements, while being treated as a single DOM-element. Add to that that several browsers have their own distinct look and feel for the file input, and you're set for nightmare. See this article on quirksmode.org about the quirks the file input has. I guarantee you it won't make you happy (I speak from experience).[EDIT]Actually, I think you might get away with putting your input in a container element (like a div), and adding a negative margin to the element. Effectively hiding the textbox part off screen.

Another option would be to use the technique in the article I linked, to try to style it like a button.Fix to work in all browsers

RESOLVED:I have tested in FF, Chrome & IE - working fine, applied styles too :DI tried to implement the top two solutions, and it ended up being a HUGE waste of time for me.  In the end, applying this .css class solved the problem...Done!  super clean and super simple...Another easy way of doing this. Make a "input type file" tag in html and hide it. Then click a button and format it according to need. After this use javascript/jquery to programmatically click the input tag when the button is clicked.HTML :-JavaScript :-jQuery :-CSS :-Here is a working JS fiddle for the same :- http://jsfiddle.net/32na3/I used some of the code recommended above and after many hours of waisting my time, I eventually came to a css bag free solution.You can run it over here - http://jsfiddle.net/WqGph/but then found a better solution - http://jsfiddle.net/XMMc4/5/Here is my good ol' remedy:At least it worked in Safari.Plain and simple.You could label an image so when you click on it the click event of the button will be triggered. You can simply make the normal button invisible:It worked for me on all browsers, and is very easy to use.You can dispatch the click event on a hidden file input like this:HTML:JQUERYHope this works :)You can give the input element a font opacity of 0. This will hide the text field without hiding the 'Choose Files' button.No javascript required, clear cross browser as far back as IE 9E.g.,     Ive a really hacky solution with this...The problem is the width attribute that is hiding the text field will obvously vary between browsers, vary between Windows XP themes and so on. Maybe its something you can work with though?...I know this is an old post but a simple way to make the text dissapear is just to set text color to that of your background.eg if your text input background is white then:This will not effect the Choose File text which will still be black due to the browser.This works for me:my solution is just to set it within a div like "druveen" said, however i ad my own button style to the div (make it look like a button with a:hover) and i just set the style "opacity:0;" to the input. Works a charm for me, hope it does the same for you.I just styled an input file with width: 85px, and the text field disappeared at allThis HTML code show up only Upload File buttonFor me, the simplest way is using a font color like background color. Simple, not elegant, but usefull.So here's the best way to do this FOR ALL BROWSERS:Forget CSS!All these answers are cute, but CSS won't work since it isn't the same across all browsers and devices, the first answer I wrote will work in everything but Safari. To get it to work accross all browsers all the time it must be created dynamically and recreated every time you want to clear the input text:The answer of tmanthey is quite good, except that you can't play with border-width in Firefox v20. If you see the link (demo, can't really show here) they solved the problem using font-size=23px, transform:translate(-300px, 0px) scale(4) for Firefox to get the button bigger.

Other solutions using .click() on a different div is useless if you want to make it a drag'n'drop input box.There are several valid options here but thought I would give what I have come up with while trying to fix a similar issue.  http://jsfiddle.net/5RyrG/1/ Resolved with the following code:<div style="overflow: hidden;width:83px;">

   <input style='float:right;' name="userfile" id="userfile" type="file"/>

</div>I wrote this:Work fine in all browsers, no jQuery, no CSS. Here is a simplified version of @ampersandre's popular solution that works in all major browsers.

Asp.NET markupJQuery Codecss codeUses a hidden "UploadButton" click trigger for server postback with standard . The  with "Upload File" text pushes the input control out of view in the wrapper div when it overflows so there is no need to apply any styles for the "file input" control div. The $([id$="FileInput"]) selector allows section of ids with standard ASP.NET prefixes applied. The FilePath textbox value in set from server code behind from hdnFileName.Value once file is uploaded.

Browser doesn't scale below 400px?

[Browser doesn't scale below 400px?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8681903/browser-doesnt-scale-below-400px)

I'm working on putting together a liquid style-sheet and it works wonderful. One thing that I've noticed is that my browser window in Chrome won't resize below 400px it just gets stuck there and in FF as I scale down it it just stops at around 400px and then pops a horizontal scroll bar.When I open the site on my phone it looks perfect at around 320px, so I know it does scale lower than 400px. I was curious if anyone knew if this was a browser/desktop thing or if I should be looking at something other than my CSS. I don't have any min-width declarations so i'm not sure what could be causing this.Again on desktop it scales down to a min-width of about 400px and stops, but when I open it up on my phone it scales to the size of the phone screen which is roughly 320px... curious why at the very least it won't scale down to the 320px on desktop.-edit-

Also I'm not sure if this matters but Opera allows it to scale down to pretty much nothing... So it works with Opera and not in Chrome or FF... any ideas?

Also I'm not sure if this matters but Opera allows it to scale down to pretty much nothing... So it works with Opera and not in Chrome or FF... any ideas?Chrome cannot resize horizontally below 400px (OS X) or 218px (Windows) but I have a really simple solution to the problem:Update: Chrome now allows you to arrange the inspector windows vertically when docked to the right! This really improves the layout.The HTML and CSS panels fit really well and you even open a small console panel too. 

This has allowed me to completely move from Firefox/Firebug to Chrome.If you want to go a step further look at the web inspector settings (cog icon, bottom-right), and goto the user agent tab. You can set the screen resolution to whatever you like here and even quickly toggle between portrait and landscape.UPDATE: Here is another really cool tool I've come across. http://lab.maltewassermann.com/viewport-resizer/this may be because of the addons you installed on your browser. remove or hide all addon icons from the tool bar and try re size. when there are addons browser only resize the address bar and keeps the addons visible.Update: 7/14/2013With the latest chrome version, now you can re-size the address bar and it will hide the addons automatically. I was stumped as well but ended up with a simple solution.  I just created a HTML file with a link to open a new window:This new window has nothing but the address bar and Chrome lets me freely resize this down to 111x80.nayan9's solution works great, and can be put into a bookmark without having to create a html file. In Chrome, create a new bookmark with URL:And give it a name of "Open Small Window" or something similar. This will allow you to easily open windows without size restrictions within chrome. Note that just copying this into your address bar won't work - chrome strips the "javascript:" out.In case you want to reduce your screen width to emulate different devices (and why else would you want to do this?):Chrome now has an Emulation section in its inspector, activated by clicking the little phone icon in the top menubar (between the magnifying glass and Elements):Emulation mode allows you to set the viewport size to all common mobile screen sizes, among other nice features, like emulating touch, geolocation and even accelerometer input:Adding to what nayan9 and drinkdecaf said, you can just throw document.URL into the call to window.open to see the page you're currently viewing in the 320 window. You might want to add some more to the width if you're expecting a scrollbar.The DevTools in Chrome have moved on substantially from when most of these answers were posted. The best way to address this issue now is to use the emulators that are built into Chrome.To use the emulators open DevTools (press F12) and then click on the following icon to toggle the Device Toolbar:This will then allow you to emulate whichever mobile device or viewport size you want to.in chrome the icons of your addons in the top right corner cause the problem -> resize the adress-bar (where you type the urls) to maximum width (drag the bar at the right edge to the right)or disable the iconsI am lazy, to make it even easier, let the bookmarklet ask the user for sizes :-DI found a quick workaround for this. Just install the Responsive Web Design Add-on to Chrome, and it will open a separate window without the address bar and tabs, which can be scaled down to 10 px or less. Link here: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/responsive-web-design-tes/bdpelkpfhjfiacjeobkhlkkgaphbobea/relatedI've been experiencing similar issues and just found a good work around.  Open up your chrome devtools and in the top left, there's a little screen and ipad icon.  Click that and it opens a mobile view of your page.  You can set it to predefined devices or a custom resolution.  Pretty nifty actually.Another easy solution is to click Strg+Shift+N to enter Incognito Mode. There you can resize your Browser window as you like.I like this tool because it lets you switch quickly and also switches between portrait/horizontal easily for mobile sizes. It also allows you to make a personalized bookmark let, so if you design for obscure resolutions frequently, you can save them and use them.I had to use one of these tools because even with the above answer I couldn't get my window to scale to 320 properly, this tool seems to be a faster solution overall.http://lab.maltewassermann.com/viewport-resizer/I'm always running into this issue with pinned tabs. Chrome will not resize below a horizontal width of eight visible pinned tabs if there are any! Just detach the tab that you want to resize to solve this ...A lot of smart phones scale the page to fit into their screen size using zooming.  Your minimum page width is probably 400px.  Without any example code, I think that's all that can be said.
