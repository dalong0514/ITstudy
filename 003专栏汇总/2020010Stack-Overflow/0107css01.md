For anchors that act like buttons (for example, Questions, Tags, Users, etc. at the top of the Stack Overflow page) or tabs, is there a CSS standard way to disable the highlighting effect if the user accidentally selects the text?I realize this could be done with JavaScript, and a little googling yielded the Mozilla-only -moz-user-select option.Is there a standard-compliant way to accomplish this with CSS, and if not, what is the "best practice" approach?UPDATE January, 2017:According to Can I use, the user-select is currently supported in all browsers except Internet Explorer 9 and earlier versions (but sadly still needs a vendor prefix).All of the correct CSS variations are:Note that it's a non-standard feature (i.e. not a part of any specification). It is not guaranteed to work everywhere, and there might be differences in implementation among browsers and in the future browsers can drop support for it.More information can be found in Mozilla Developer Network documentation.In most browsers, this can be achieved using proprietary variations on the CSS user-select property, originally proposed and then abandoned in CSS 3 and now proposed in CSS UI Level 4:For Internet Explorer < 10 and Opera < 15, you will need to use the unselectable attribute of the element you wish to be unselectable. You can set this using an attribute in HTML:Sadly this property isn't inherited, meaning you have to put an attribute in the start tag of every element inside the <div>. If this is a problem, you could instead use JavaScript to do this recursively for an element's descendants:Update 30 April 2014: This tree traversal needs to be rerun whenever a new element is added to the tree, but it seems from a comment by @Han that it is possible to avoid this by adding a mousedown event handler that sets unselectable on the target of the event. See http://jsbin.com/yagekiji/1 for details.This still doesn't cover all possibilities. While it is impossible to initiate selections in unselectable elements, in some browsers (Internet Explorer and Firefox, for example) it's still impossible to prevent selections that start before and end after the unselectable element without making the whole document unselectable.A JavaScript solution for Internet Explorer is:Until CSS 3's user-select property becomes available, Gecko-based browsers support the -moz-user-select property you already found. WebKit and Blink-based browsers support the -webkit-user-select property.This of course is not supported in browsers that do not use the Gecko rendering engine.There is no "standards" compliant quick-and-easy way to do it; using JavaScript is an option.The real question is, why do you want users to not be able to highlight and presumably copy and paste certain elements? I have not come across a single time that I wanted to not let users highlight a certain portion of my website. Several of my friends, after spending many hours reading and writing code will use the highlight feature as a way to remember where on the page they were, or providing a marker so that their eyes know where to look next.The only place I could see this being useful is if you have buttons for forms that should not be copy and pasted if a user copy and pasted the website.If you want to disable text selection on everything except on <p> elements, you can do this in CSS (watch out for the -moz-none which allows override in sub-elements, which is allowed in other browsers with none):In the solutions in previous answers selection is stopped, but the user still thinks you can select text because the cursor still changes. To keep it static, you'll have to set your CSS cursor:This will make your text totally flat, like it would be in a desktop application.You can do so in Firefox and Safari (Chrome also?)Workaround for WebKit:I found it in a CardFlip example.I like the hybrid CSS + jQuery solution.To make all elements inside <div class="draggable"></div> unselectable, use this CSS:And then, if you're using jQuery, add this inside a $(document).ready() block:I figure you still want any input elements to be interactable, hence the :not() pseudo-selector. You could use '*' instead if you don't care.Caveat: Internet Explorer 9 may not need this extra jQuery piece, so you may want to add a version check in there.It's not the best way, though.You can use CSS or JavaScript for that.The JavaScript way is supported in older browsers, like old versions of Internet Explorer as well, but if it's not your case, use the CSS way then:HTML/JavaScript:HTML/CSS:For Internet Explorer in addition, you need to add pseudo class focus (.ClassName:focus) and outline-style: none.Try to insert these rows into the CSS and call the "disHighlight" at class property:A Quick Hack UpdateIf you use the value none for all the CSS user-select properties (including browser prefixes of it), there is a problem which can be still occurred by this.As CSS-Tricks says, the problem is:WebKit still allows the text to be copied, if you select elements around it.You can also use the below one to enforce that an entire element gets selected which means if you click on an element, all the text wrapped in that element will get selected. For this all you have to do is changing the value none to all.For those who have trouble achieving the same in the Android browser with the touch event, use:WorkingCSS:This should work, but it won't work for the old browsers. There is a browser compatibility issue.If you are using Less and Bootstrap you could write:Aside from the Mozilla-only property, no, there is no way to disable text selection with just standard CSS (as of now).If you notice, Stack Overflow doesn't disable text selection for their navigation buttons, and I would recommend against doing so in most cases, since it modifies normal selection behavior and makes it conflict with a user's expectations.This works in some browsers:Simply add your desired elements/ids in front of the selectors separated by commas without spaces, like so:The other answers are better; this should probably be seen as a last resort/catchall.Suppose there are two divs like this:Set cursor to default so that it will give a unselectable feel to the user.You can do this with a mixin:In an HTML tag:Try it in this CodePen.If you are using an autoprefixer you can remove other prefix.This will be useful if color selection is also not needed:...all other browser fixes. It will work in Internet Explorer 9 or later.Add this to the first div in which you want to disable the selection for text:NOTE:The correct answer is correct in that it prevents you from being able to select the text. However, it does not prevent you from being able to copy the text, as I'll show with the next couple of screenshots (as of 7th Nov 2014).As you can see, we were unable to select the numbers, but we were able to copy them.Tested on: Ubuntu, Google Chrome 38.0.2125.111.To get the result I needed, I found I had to use both ::selection and user-selectThis is not CSS, but it is worth a mention:jQuery UI Disable Selection:Check my solution without JavaScript:jsFiddlePopup menu with my technique applied: http://jsfiddle.net/y4Lac/2/Though this pseudo-element was in drafts of CSS Selectors Level 3, it was removed during the Candidate Recommendation phase, as it appeared that its behavior was under-specified, especially with nested elements, and interoperability wasn't achieved.It's being discussed in How ::selection works on nested elements.Despite it is being implemented in browsers, you can make an illusion of text not being selected by using the same color and background color on selection as of the tab design (in your case).Disallowing users to select the text will raise usability issues.It is easily done with:Alternatively:Let's say you have a <h1 id="example">Hello, World!</h1>. You will have to remove the innerHTML of that h1, in this case Hello, World. Then you will have to go to CSS and do this:Now it simply thinks it is a block-element, and not text.

I have a div element which contains text, and I want to align the contents of this div vertically center.Here is my div style:What is the best way to do this?

2012-01-14 21:25:10Z

I have a div element which contains text, and I want to align the contents of this div vertically center.Here is my div style:What is the best way to do this?You can try this basic approach:It only works for a single line of text though, because we set the line's height to the same height as the containing box element.This is another way to align text vertically. This solution will work for a single line and multiple lines of text, but it still requires a fixed height container:The CSS just sizes the <div>, vertically center aligns the <span> by setting the <div>'s line-height equal to its height, and makes the <span> an inline-block with vertical-align: middle. Then it sets the line-height back to normal for the <span>, so its contents will flow naturally inside the block.And here is another option, which may not work on older browsers that don't support display: table and display: table-cell (basically just Internet Explorer 7). Using CSS we simulate table behavior (since tables support vertical alignment), and the HTML is the same as the second example:This technique uses an absolutely positioned element setting top, bottom, left and right to 0. It is described in more detail in an article in Smashing Magazine, Absolute Horizontal And Vertical Centering In CSS.Another way (not mentioned here yet) is with Flexbox.Just add the following code to the container element:Alternatively, instead of aligning the content via the container, flexbox can also center the a flex item with an auto margin when there is only one flex-item in the flex container (like the example given in the question above).So to center the flex item both horizontally and vertically just set it with margin:autoNB: All the above applies to centering items while laying them out in horizontal rows. This is also the default behavior, because by default the value for flex-direction is row. If, however flex-items need to be laid out in vertical columns, then flex-direction: column should be set on the container to set the main-axis as column and additionally the justify-content and align-items properties now work the other way around with justify-content: center centering vertically and  align-items: center centering horizontally)A good place to start with Flexbox to see some of its features and get syntax for maximum browser support is flexyboxes Also, browser support nowadays is very good: caniuseFor cross-browser compatibility for display: flex and align-items, you can use the following:You can easily do this by adding the following piece of CSS code:That means your CSS finally looks like:For reference and to add a simpler answer:Pure CSS:Or as a SASS/SCSS Mixin:Use by:By Sebastian Ekström's blog post Vertical align anything with just 3 lines of CSS:This method can cause elements to be blurry due to the element being placed on a「half pixel」. A solution for this is to set its parent element to preserve-3d. Like following:We live in 2015+ and Flex Box is supported by every major modern browser.It will be the way websites are made from here on out.Learn it!All credit goes to this link owner @Sebastian Ekström Link; please go through this. See it in action codepen. By reading the above article I also created a demo fiddle.With just three lines of CSS (excluding vendor prefixes) we can do it with the help of a transform: translateY vertically centers whatever we want, even if we don’t know its height.The CSS property transform is usually used for rotating and scaling elements, but with its translateY function we can now vertically align elements. Usually this must be done with absolute positioning or setting line-heights, but these require you to either know the height of the element or only works on single-line text, etc.So, to do this we write:That’s all you need. It is a similar technique to the absolute-position method, but with the upside that we don’t have to set any height on the element or position-property on the parent. It works straight out of the box, even in Internet Explorer 9!To make it even more simple, we can write it as a mixin with its vendor prefixes.Flexboxes that were introduced in CSS3 are the solution:Tip: Replace the line above which is marked as "Key Part" with one of these lines, if you want to center the text:1) Only vertically:2) Only horizontally:As I noticed, this trick works with grids (i.e. display: grid), also.Flexible approachThe solution accepted as the answer is perfect to use line-height the same as the height of div, but this solution does not work perfectly when text is wrapped OR is in two lines.Try this one if text is wrapped or is on multiple lines inside a div.For more reference, see:Try this solution:Built using CSS+.You can use the following code snippet as the reference. It is working like a charm for me:The output of the above code snippet is as follow:You can also use below properties.Another way:Don't set the height attribute of the div, but instead use padding: to achieve the effect. Similarly to line-height, it only works if you have one line of text.  Although this way, if you have more content, the text will still be centered, but the div itself will be slightly larger.So instead of going with:You can say:This will set the top and bottom padding of the div to 60px, and the left and right padding to zero, making the div 120 pixels (plus the height of your font) high, and placing the text vertically centered in the div.Here is another option using flexbox.I saw the previous answers, and they will work only for that width of screen (not responsive). For the responsive you have to use flex.Example:I'm not sure anyone has gone the writing-mode route, but I think it solves the problem cleanly and has broad support:This will, of course, work with any dimensions you need (besides 100% of the parent). If you uncomment the border lines, it'll be helpful to familiarize yourself.JSFiddle demo for you to fiddle.Caniuse support: 85.22% + 6.26% = 91.48% (even Internet Explorer is in!)For all your vertical alignment needs!Declare this Mixin:Then include it in your element:Even better idea for this. You can do like this too For a single line of text (or a single character) you can use this technique:It can be used when #box has a non-fixed, relative height in %.<div id="box"></div>See a live demo at JsBin (easier to edit CSS) or JsFiddle (easier to change height of result frame).If you want to place inner text in HTML, not in CSS, then you need to wrap text content in additional inline element and edit #box::after to match it. (And, of course, content: property should be removed.)For example,

<div id="box"><span>TextContent</span></div>.

In this case, #box::after should be replaced with #box span.For Internet Explorer 8 support you must replace :: with :.Try the transform property:The simple and versatile way is (as Michielvoo's

table approach):Using this attribute (or a equivalent class) on a parent tag works even for many children to align:A very simple & most powerful solution to vertically align center:The following code will put the div in the middle of the screen regardless of screen size or div size:See more details about flex here. Try the following code:I would just like to extend the answer from Michielvoo in order to release need for line-height and breathing of div height. It is basically just a simplified version like this:NOTE: commented out part of cssis needed for fixed-height of enclosing div.I needed a row of clickable elephants, vertically centered, but without using a table to get around some Internet Explorer 9 weirdness.I eventually found the nicest CSS (for my needs) and it's great with Firefox, Chrome, and Internet Explorer 11. Sadly Internet Explorer 9 is still laughing at me...Obviously you don't need the borders, but they can help you see how it works.You can use the positioning method in CSS:Check the result here.... HTML:CSS:Hope you use this method too.Set it within button instead of div if you don't care about its little visual 3D effect.This is easy and very short:Absolute Positioning and StretchingAs with the method above this one begins by setting positioning on the parent and child elements as relative and absolute respectively. From there things differ.In the code below I’ve once again used this method to center the child both horizontally and vertically, though you can use the method for vertical centering only.HTMLCSSThe idea with this method is to try to get the child element to stretch to all four edges by setting the top, bottom, right, and left vales to 0. Because our child element is smaller than our parent elements it can’t reach all four edges.Setting auto as the margin on all four sides however causes opposite margins to be equal and displays our child div in the center of the parent div.Unfortunately the above won’t work in Internet Explorer 7 and below, and like the previous method the content inside the child div can grow too large, causing it to be hidden.Add this small code in the CSS property of your element. It is awesome. Try it!

I have a layout with two columns - a left div and a right div.The right div has a grey background-color, and I need it to expand vertically depending on the height of the user's browser window. Right now the background-color ends at the last piece of content in that div. I've tried height:100%, min-height:100%;, etc.There are a couple of CSS 3 measurement units called:From the linked W3 Candidate Recommendation above:These units are vh (viewport height), vw (viewport width), vmin (viewport minimum length) and vmax (viewport maximum length).For this question, we can make use of vh: 1vh is equal to 1% of the viewport's height. That is to say, 100vh is equal to the height of the browser window, regardless of where the element is situated in the DOM tree:This is literally all that's needed. Here is a JSFiddle example of this in use.This is currently supported on all up-to-date major browsers apart from Opera Mini. Check out Can I use... for further support.In the case of the question at hand, featuring a left and a right divider, here is a JSFiddle example showing a two-column layout involving both vh and vw.Take this layout for example:The p tag here is set to 100% height, but because its containing div has 200 pixels height, 100% of 200 pixels becomes 200 pixels, not 100% of the body height. Using 100vh instead means that the p tag will be 100% height of the body regardless of the div height. Take a look at this accompanying JSFiddle to easily see the difference!If you want to set the height of a <div> or any element, you should set the height of <body> and <html> to 100% too. Then you can set the height of element with 100% :)Here is an example:If you’re able to absolutely position your elements,would do it.You can use the view-port unit in CSS:HTML:CSS:You can use vh in this case which is relative to 1% of the height of the viewport...That means if you want to cover off the height, just simply use 100vh.Look at the image below I draw for you here:Try the snippet I created for you as below:All the other solutions, including the top-voted one with vh are sub-optimal when compared to the flex model solution.With the advent of the CSS flex model, solving the 100% height problem becomes very, very easy: use height: 100%; display: flex on the parent, and flex: 1 on the child elements. They'll automatically take up all the available space in their container.Note how simple the markup and the CSS are. No table hacks or anything.The flex model is supported by all major browsers as well as IE11+.Learn more about the flex model here.You don't mention a few important details like:Here's one possibility:There are many variations on this depending on which columns need to be fixed and which are liquid. You can do this with absolute positioning too but I've generally found better results (particularly in terms of cross-browser) using floats instead.This is what worked for me:Use position:fixed instead of position:absolute, that way even if you scroll down the division will expand to the end of the screen.Here's a fix for the height.In your CSS use:For browser that don't support vh-units, use modernizr.Add this script (to add detection for vh-units)Finally use this function to add the height of the viewport to #your-object if the browser doesn't support vh-units:100% works differently for width and height.When you specify width: 100%, it means "take up 100% of the available width from the parent element or width of the window."When you specify height: 100%, it only means "take up 100% of available height from the parent element." This means if you don't specify a height at a top level element, the height of all the children will be either 0 or height of the parent, and that is why you need to set the topmost element to have a min-height of window height.I always specify the body to have a min-height of 100vh and it makes positioning and calculations easy,Add min-height: 100% and don't specify a height (or put it on auto). It totally did the job for me:100vw === 100% of the width of the viewport.100vh === 100% of the height of the viewport.If you want to set the div width or height 100% of browser-window-size you should use:For width: 100vwFor height: 100vhOr if you want to set it smaller size, use the CSS calc function. Example:There are several methods available for setting the height of a <div> to 100%.Method (A):Method (B) using vh:Method (c) using flex box:This worked for me:Taken from this page.Try to set height:100% in html & body And if you want to 2 div height same use or set the parent element display:flex property.Simplest way is to do it like this.Just use the "vh" unit instead of "px", which means view-port height. Block elements consume the full width of their parent, by default.This is how they meet their design requirement, which is to stack vertically.This behavior, however, does not extend to height.By default, most elements are the height of their content (height: auto).Unlike with width, you need to specify a height if you want extra space.Therefore, keep these two things in mind:Here is something that is not exactly like what you had in previous answers, but it could be helpful to some:https://jsfiddle.net/newdark/qyxkk558/10/Use FlexBox CSSFlexbox is a perfect fit for this type of problem. While mostly known for laying out content in the horizontal direction, Flexbox actually works just as well for vertical layout problems. All you have to do is wrap the vertical sections in a flex container and choose which ones you want to expand. They’ll automatically take up all the available space in their container.One of the options is using CSS table. It has great browser support and even works in Internet Explorer 8.JSFiddle ExampleTry this - tested:You can use display: flex and height: 100vhYou need to do two things, one is to set the height to 100% which you already did. Second is set the position to absolute. That should do the trick.SourceTry the following CSS:Actually what worked for me best was using the vh property.In my React application I wanted the div to match the page high even when resized. I tried height: 100%;, overflow-y: auto;, but none of them worked when setting height:(your percent)vh; it worked as intended.Note: if you are using padding, round corners, etc., make sure to subtract those values from your vh property percent or it adds extra height and make scroll bars appear. Here's my sample:If you use position: absolute; and jQuery, you could useYou have to set up only height:100%.

I am trying to make a <ul> slide down using CSS transitions.The <ul> starts off at height: 0;. On hover, the height is set to height:auto;. However, this is causing it to simply appear, not transition,If I do it from height: 40px; to height: auto;, then it will slide up to height: 0;, and then suddenly jump to the correct height.How else could I do this without using JavaScript?Use max-height in the transition and not height. And set a value on max-height to something bigger than your box will ever get.See JSFiddle demo provided by Chris Jordan in another answer here.You should use scaleY instead.I've made a vendor prefixed version of the above code on jsfiddle,  and changed your jsfiddle to use scaleY instead of height.You can't currently animate on height when one of the heights involved is auto, you have to set two explicit heights.The solution that I've always used was to first fade out, then shrink the font-size, padding and margin values. It doesn't look the same as a wipe, but it works without a static height or max-height.Working example:I know this is the thirty-somethingth answer to this question, but I think it's worth it, so here goes. This is a CSS-only solution with the following properties:Here's a demo with three collapsible elements, all of different heights, that all use the same CSS. You might want to click "full page" after clicking "run snippet". Note that the JavaScript only toggles the collapsed CSS class, there's no measuring involved. (You could do this exact demo without any JavaScript at all by using a checkbox or :target). Also note that the part of the CSS that's responsible for the transition is pretty short, and the HTML only requires a single additional wrapper element.There are in fact two transitions involved in making this happen. One of them transitions the margin-bottom from 0px (in the expanded state) to -2000px in the collapsed state (similar to this answer). The 2000 here is the first magic number, it's based on the assumption that your box won't be higher than this (2000 pixels seems like a reasonable choice).Using the margin-bottom transition alone by itself has two issues:Fixing this second issue is where the second transition comes in, and this transition conceptually targets the wrapper's minimum height ("conceptually" because we're not actually using the min-height property for this; more on that later).Here's an animation that shows how combining the bottom margin transition with the minimum height transition, both of equal duration, gives us a combined transition from full height to zero height that has the same duration.The left bar shows how the negative bottom margin pushes the bottom upwards, reducing the visible height. The middle bar shows how the minimum height ensures that in the collapsing case, the transition doesn't end early, and in the expanding case, the transition doesn't start late. The right bar shows how the combination of the two causes the box to transition from full height to zero height in the correct amount of time.For my demo I've settled on 50px as the upper minimum height value. This is the second magic number, and it should be lower than the box' height would ever be. 50px seems reasonable as well; it seems unlikely that you'd very often want to make an element collapsible that isn't even 50 pixels high in the first place.As you can see in the animation, the resulting transition is continuous, but it is not differentiable -- at the moment when the minimum height is equal to the full height adjusted by the bottom margin, there is a sudden change in speed. This is very noticeable in the animation because it uses a linear timing function for both transitions, and because the whole transition is very slow. In the actual case (my demo at the top), the transition only takes 300ms, and the bottom margin transition is not linear. I've played around with a lot of different timing functions for both transitions, and the ones I ended up with felt like they worked best for the widest variety of cases.Two problems remain to fix:We solve the first problem by giving the container element a max-height: 0 in the collapsed case, with a 0s 0.3s transition. This means that it's not really a transition, but the max-height is applied with a delay; it only applies once the transition is over. For this to work correctly, we also need to pick a numerical max-height for the opposite, non-collapsed, state. But unlike in the 2000px case, where picking too large of a number affects the quality of the transition, in this case, it really doesn't matter. So we can just pick a number that is so high that we know that no height will ever come close to this. I picked a million pixels. If you feel you may need to support content of a height of more than a million pixels, then 1) I'm sorry, and 2) just add a couple of zeros.The second problem is the reason why we're not actually using min-height for the minimum height transition. Instead, there is an ::after pseudo-element in the container with a height that transitions from 50px to zero. This has the same effect as a min-height: It won't let the container shrink below whatever height the pseudo-element currently has. But because we're using height, not min-height, we can now use max-height (once again applied with a delay) to set the pseudo-element's actual height to zero once the transition is over, ensuring that at least outside the transition, even small elements have the correct height. Because min-height is stronger than max-height, this wouldn't work if we used the container's min-height instead of the pseudo-element's height. Just like the max-height in the previous paragraph, this max-height also needs a value for the opposite end of the transition. But in this case we can just pick the 50px.Tested in Chrome (Win, Mac, Android, iOS), Firefox (Win, Mac, Android), Edge, IE11 (except for a flexbox layout issue with my demo that I didn't bother debugging), and Safari (Mac, iOS). Speaking of flexbox, it should be possible to make this work without using any flexbox; in fact I think you could make almost everything work in IE7 – except for the fact that you won't have CSS transitions, making it a rather pointless exercise.You can, with a little bit of non-semantic jiggery-pokery. My usual approach is to animate the height of an outer DIV which has a single child which is a style-less DIV used only for measuring the content height.One would like to just be able to dispense with the .measuringWrapper and just set the DIV's height to auto and have that animate, but that doesn't seem to work (the height gets set, but no animation occurs).My interpretation is that an explicit height is needed for the animation to run. You can't get an animation on height when either height (the start or end height) is auto.A visual workaround to animating height using CSS3 transitions is to animate the padding instead. You don't quite get the full wipe effect, but playing around with the transition-duration and padding values should get you close enough. If you don't want to explicitly set height/max-height, this should be what you're looking for.http://jsfiddle.net/catharsis/n5XfG/17/ (riffed off stephband's above jsFiddle)My workaround is to transition max-height to the exact content height for a nice smooth animation, then use a transitionEnd callback to set max-height to 9999px so the content can resize freely.The accepted answer works for most cases, but it doesn't work well when your div can vary greatly in height — the animation speed is not dependent on the actual height of the content, and it can look choppy.You can still perform the actual animation with CSS, but you need to use JavaScript to compute the height of the items, instead of trying to use auto. No jQuery is required, although you may have to modify this a bit if you want compatibility (works in the latest version of Chrome :)).No hard coded values.No JavaScript.No approximations.The trick is to use a hidden & duplicated div to get the browser to understand what 100% means. This method is suitable whenever you're able to duplicate the DOM of the element you wish to animate. There was little mention of the Element.scrollHeight property which can be useful here and still may be used with a pure CSS transition. The property always contains the "full" height of an element, regardless of whether and how its content overflows as a result of collapsed height (e.g. height: 0).As such, for a height: 0 (effectively fully collapsed) element, its "normal" or "full" height is still readily available through its scrollHeight value (invariably a pixel length).For such an element, assuming it already has the transition set up like e.g. (using ul as per original question):We can trigger desired animated "expansion" of height, using CSS only, with something like the following (here assuming ul variable refers to the list):That's it. If you need to collapse the list, either of the two following statements will do:My particular use case revolved around animating lists of unknown and often considerable lengths, so I was not comfortable settling on an arbitrary "large enough" height or max-height specification and risking cut-off content or content that you suddenly need to scroll (if overflow: auto, for example). Additionally, the easing and timing is broken with max-height-based solutions, because the used height may reach its maximum value a lot sooner than it would take for max-height to reach 9999px. And as screen resolutions grow, pixel lengths like 9999px leave a bad taste in my mouth. This particular solution solves the problem in an elegant manner, in my opinion.Finally, here is hoping that future revisions of CSS address authors' need to do these kind of things even more elegantly -- revisit the notion of "computed" vs "used" and "resolved" values, and consider whether transitions should apply to computed values, including transitions with width and height (which currently get a bit of a special treatment).Use max-height with different transition easing and delay for each state. HTML:CSS:See example: http://jsfiddle.net/0hnjehjc/1/As I post this there are over 30 answers already, but I feel my answer improves on the already accepted answer by jake.I was not content with the issue that arises from simply using max-height and CSS3 transitions, since as many commenters noted, you have to set your max-height value very close to the actual height or you'll get a delay. See this JSFiddle for an example of that problem.To get around this (while still using no JavaScript), I added another HTML element that transitions the transform: translateY CSS value.This means both max-height and translateY are used: max-height allows the element to push down elements below it, while translateY gives the "instant" effect we want. The issue with max-height still exists, but its effect is lessened.

This means you can set a much larger height for your max-height value and worry about it less.The overall benefit is that on the transition back in (the collapse), the user sees the translateY animation immediately, so it doesn't really matter how long the max-height takes.Solution as FiddleOk, so I think I came up with a super simple answer...

no max-height, uses relative positioning, works on li elements, & is pure CSS.

I have not tested in anything but Firefox, though judging by the CSS, it should work on all browsers.FIDDLE: http://jsfiddle.net/n5XfG/2596/CSSHTMLEDIT: Scroll down for updated answer 

I was making a drop down list and saw this Post ... many different answers but I decide to share my drop down list too, ... It's not perfect but at least it will using only css for drop down! I've been using transform:translateY(y) to transform the list to the view ...

You can see more in the test 

http://jsfiddle.net/BVEpc/4/ 

I've placed div behind every li because my drop down list are coming from up and to show them properly this was needed, my div code is:and hover is : and because ul height is set to the content it can get over your body content that's why I did this for ul:and hover:the second time after transition is delay and it will get hidden after my drop down list has been closed animately ... 

Hope later someone get benefit of this one.

EDIT: I just can't believe ppl actually using this prototype! this drop down menu is only for one sub menu and that's all!!

I've updated a better one that can have two sub menu for both ltr and rtl direction with IE 8 support.

hopefully someone find this useful in future.You can transition from height:0 to height:auto providing that you also provide min-height and max-height.Flexbox SolutionPros:Cons:The way it works is by always having flex-basis: auto on the element with content, and transitioning flex-grow and flex-shrink instead. Edit: Improved JS Fiddle inspired by the Xbox One interface. JS FiddleI think I came up with a really solid solutionOK! I know this problem is as old as the internet but I think I have a solution which I turned into a plugin called mutant-transition. My solution sets the style="" attributes for tracked elements whenever theres a change in the DOM. the end result is that you can use good ole CSS for your transitions and not use hacky fixes or special javascript. The only thing you have to do is set what you want to track on the element in question using data-mutant-attributes="X". Thats it! This solution uses MutationObserver to follow changes in the DOM. Because of this, you don't really have to set anything up or use javascript to manually animate things. Changes are tracked automatically. However, because it uses MutationObserver, this will only transition in IE11+. 

Fiddles!Expanding on @jake's answer, the transition will go all the way to the max height value, causing an extremely fast animation - if you set the transitions for both :hover and off you can then control the crazy speed a little bit more.So the li:hover is when the mouse enters the state and then the transition on the non-hovered property will be the mouse leave.Hopefully this will be of some help.e.g: Here's a fiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/BukwJ/Here's a way to transition from any starting height, including 0, to auto (full size and flexible) without requiring hard-set code on a per-node basis or any user-code to initialize: https://github.com/csuwildcat/transition-auto. This is basically the holy grail for what you want, I believe --> http://codepen.io/csuwldcat/pen/kwsdF. Just slap the following JS file into your page, and all you need to do after that is add/remove a single boolean attribute - reveal="" - from the nodes you want to expand and contract.Here's all you need to do as the user, once you include the code block found below the example code:Here's the code block to include in your page, after that, it's all gravy:Drop this JS file in your page - it all Just Works™/* Code for height: auto; transitioning *//* Code for DEMO */Jake's answer to animate the max-height is great, but I found the delay caused by setting a large max-height annoying.One could move the collapsable content into an inner div and calculate the max height by getting the height of the inner div (via JQuery it'd be the outerHeight()).Here's a jsfiddle link: http://jsfiddle.net/pbatey/duZpTHere's a jsfiddle with the absolute minimal amount of code required: http://jsfiddle.net/8ncjjxh8/I realize this thread is getting old, but it ranks high on certain Google searches so I figure it's worth updating.You also just get/set the element's own height:You should dump this Javascript immediately after target_box's closing tag in an inline script tag.I was able to do this. I have a .child & a .parent div. The child div fits perfectly within the parent's width/height with absolute positioning. I then animate the translate property to push it's Y value down 100%. Its very smooth animation, no glitches or down sides like any other solution here.Something like this, pseudo codeYou would specify a height on .parent, in px, %, or leave as auto. This div then masks out the .child div when it slides down.Here's a solution I just used in combination with jQuery. This works for the following HTML structure:and the function:You could then use a click function to set and remove the height using css()CSS:I've recently been transitioning the max-height on the li elements rather than the wrapping ul.The reasoning is that the delay for small max-heights is far less noticeable (if at all) compared to large max-heights, and I can also set my max-height value relative to the font-size of the li rather than some arbitrary huge number by using ems or rems.If my font size is 1rem, I'll set my max-height to something like 3rem (to accommodate wrapped text). You can see an example here:http://codepen.io/mindfullsilence/pen/DtzjEI've met the requirements of no JS using Technique 2: transform: scaleY() of the article below.I posted an answer with some JavaScript and got downvoted, so got annoyed and tried again, and have cracked it with CSS only!This solution uses a few 'techniques':The upshot though is that we get performant transitioning using CSS only, and a single transition function to smoothly achieve the transition; the holy grail!Of course, there's a downside! I can't work out how to control the width at which content gets cut off (overflow:hidden); because of the padding-bottom hack, the width and height are intimately related.  There may be a way though, so will come back to it.https://jsfiddle.net/EoghanM/n1rp3zb4/28/I have not read everything in detail but I have had this problem recently and I did what follows:This allows you to have a div that at first shows content up to 200px height and on hover it's size becomes at least as high as the whole content of the div. The Div does not become 3000px but 3000px is the limit that I am imposing. Make sure to have the transition on the non :hover, otherwise you might get some strange rendering. In this way the :hover inherits from the non :hover. Transition does not work form px to % or to auto. You need to use same unit of measure.

This works fine for me. Using HTML5 makes it perfect....Remember that there is always a work around... ; )Hope someone finds this usefulThe max-height solution from Jake works well, if the hard-coded

max-height value supplied is not much bigger than the real height

(because otherwise there are undesirable delays and timing problems).

On the other hand if the hard-coded value accidentially is 

not bigger than the real height the element won't open up completely.The following CSS only solution also requires a hard-coded size that

should be bigger than most of the occurring real sizes.  However this

solution also works if the real size is in some situations bigger than

the hard-coded size. In that event the transition might jump a bit,

but it will never leave a partially visible element.

So this solution could also be used for unknown content, e.g. from

a database, where you just know that the content is usually not bigger

than x pixels, but there are exceptions.Idea is to use a negative value for margin-bottom (or margin-top for a

slightly diffenrent animation) and to place the content element into a

middle element with overflow:hidden. The negative margin of the content

element so reduces the height of the middle element.The following code uses a transition on margin-bottom from -150px to

0px.  This alone works fine as long as the content element is not

higher than 150px. In addition it uses a transition on max-height for the

middle element from 0px to 100%.  This finally hides the middle element

if the content element is higher than 150px.

For max-height the transition is just used to delay its application

by a second when closing, not for a smooth visiual effect (

and therefore it can run from  0px to 100%).CSS:HTML:The value for margin bottom should be negative and as close as

possible to the real height of the content element. If it('s absoute

value) is bigger there are similar delay and timing problems as with

the max-height solutions, which however can be limited as long as the

hard coded size is not much bigger than the real one. If the absolute

value for margin-bottom is smaller than the real height the 

tansition jumps a bit. In any case after the transition the

content element is either fully displayed or fully removed.For more details see my blog post http://www.taccgl.org/blog/css_transition_display.html#combined_heightThis isn't exactly a "solution" to the problem, but more of a workaround. It only works as written with text, but can be changed to work with other elements as needed I'm sure.Here is an example: http://codepen.io/overthemike/pen/wzjRKaEssentially, you set the font-size to 0 and transition that instead of the height, or max-height, or scaleY() etc. at a quick enough pace to get the height to transform to what you want. To transform the actual height with CSS to auto isn't currently possible, but transforming the content within is, hence the font-size transition.

How can I make a div not larger than its contents?

[How can I make a div not larger than its contents?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/450903/how-can-i-make-a-div-not-larger-than-its-contents)

I have a layout similar to:I would like for the div to only expand to as wide as my table becomes.

I have a layout similar to:I would like for the div to only expand to as wide as my table becomes.The solution is to set your div to display: inline-block.You want a block element that has what CSS calls shrink-to-fit width and the spec does not provide a blessed way to get such a thing. In CSS2, shrink-to-fit is not a goal, but means to deal with a situation where browser "has to" get a width out of thin air. Those situations are: when there are no width specified. I heard they think of adding what you want in CSS3. For now, make do with one of the above.The decision not to expose the feature directly may seem strange, but there is a good reason. It is expensive. Shrink-to-fit means formatting at least twice: you cannot start formatting an element until you know its width, and you cannot calculate the width w/o going through entire content. Plus, one does not need shrink-to-fit element as often as one may think. Why do you need extra div around your table? Maybe table caption is all you need.I think usingwould work, however I'm not sure about the browser compatibility.Another solution would be to wrap your div in another div (if you want to maintain the block behavior):HTML:CSS:display: inline-block adds an extra margin to your element.I would recommend this:Bonus: You can also now easily center that fancy new #element just by adding margin: 0 auto.Foo Hack – Cross Browser Support for inline-block Styling (2007-11-19).You can try fit-content (CSS3): What works for me is:in the div. (Tested on Firefox and Google Chrome).There are two better solutions Out of these two display:table; is better, because display: inline-block; adds an extra margin.For display:inline-block; you can use the negative margin method to fix the extra spaceNot knowing in what context this will appear, but I believe the CSS-style property float either left or right will have this effect. On the other hand, it'll have other side effects as well, such as allowing text to float around it.Please correct me if I'm wrong though, I'm not 100% sure, and currently can't test it myself.The answer for your question lays in the future my friend ...namely "intrinsic" is coming with the latest CSS3 updateunfortunately IE is behind with it so it doesn't support it yet More about it: CSS Intrinsic & Extrinsic Sizing Module Level 3 and Can I Use?: Intrinsic & Extrinsic Sizing. For now you have to be satisfied with <span> or <div> set to A CSS2 compatible solution is to use:You can also float your div which will force it as small as possible, but you'll need to use a clearfix if anything inside your div is floating:works fine for me :)OK, in many cases you even don't need to do anything as by default div has height and width as auto, but if it's not your case, applying inline-block display gonna work for you... look at the code I create for you and it's do what you looking for:This has been mentioned in comments and is hard to find in one of the answers so:If you are using display: flex for whatever reason, you can instead use:This is also widely supported across browsers.You can do it simply by using display: inline; (or white-space: nowrap;). I hope you find this useful.You can use inline-block as @user473598, but beware of older browsers..Mozilla doesn’t support inline-block at all, but they have -moz-inline-stack which is about the sameSome cross-browser around inline-block display attribute:

https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/cross-browser-inline-block/You can see some tests with this attribute in: https://robertnyman.com/2010/02/24/css-display-inline-block-why-it-rocks-and-why-it-sucks/I know people don't like tables sometimes, but I gotta tell you, I tried the css inline hacks, and they kinda worked in some divs but in others didn't, so, it was really just easier to enclose the expanding div in a table...and...it can have or not the inline property and still the table is the one that's gonna hold the total width of the content. =)Just put a style into your CSS fileAn working demo is here-My CSS3 flexbox solution in two flavors: The one on top behaves like a span and the one at the bottom behaves like a div, taking all the width with the help of a wrapper. Their classes are "top", "bottom" and "bottomwrapper" respectively.This will make parent div width same as the largest element width.Try display: inline-block;. For it to be cross browser compatible please use the below css code.Tampering around with Firebug I found the property value -moz-fit-content which exactly does what the OP wanted and could be used as follow:Although it only works on Firefox, I couldn't find any equivalent for other browsers such as Chrome.I have solved a similar problem (where I didn't want to use display: inline-block because the item was centered) by adding a span tag inside the div tag, and moving the CSS formatting from the outer div tag to the new inner span tag. Just throwing this out there as another alternative idea if display: inline block isn't a suitable answer for you.We can use any of the two ways on the div element:   or,I prefer to use display: table;, because it handles, all extra spaces on its own. While display: inline-block needs some extra space fixing.  If you have containers breaking lines, after hours looking for a good CSS solution and finding none, I now use jQuery instead:Revised (works if you have multiple children):

Vertically align text next to an image?

[Vertically align text next to an image?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/489340/vertically-align-text-next-to-an-image)

Why won't vertical-align: middle work?  And yet, vertical-align: top does work.

2009-01-28 21:01:50Z

Why won't vertical-align: middle work?  And yet, vertical-align: top does work.Actually, in this case it's quite simple: apply the vertical align to the image. Since it's all in one line, it's really the image you want aligned, not the text.Tested in FF3.Now you can use flexbox for this type of layout.Here are some simple techniques for vertical-align:This one is easy: set the line-height of the text element to equal that of the containerAbsolutely position an inner div relative to its containerIn order to get this to work correctly across the board, you'll have to hack the CSS a bit. Luckily, there is an IE bug that works in our favor. Setting top:50% on the container and top:-50% on the inner div, you can achieve the same result. We can combine the two using another feature IE doesn't support: advanced CSS selectors.This solution requires a slightly more modern browser than the other solutions, as it makes use of the transform: translateY property. (http://caniuse.com/#feat=transforms2d)Applying the following 3 lines of CSS to an element will vertically centre it within its parent regardless of the height of the parent element:Change your div into a flex container:

Now there are two methods to center the alignments for all the content:Method 1:DEMO  Method 2:DEMO  Try different width and height values on the img and different font size values on the span and you'll see they always remain in the middle of the container.You have to apply vertical-align: middle to both elements to have it been centered perfectly.The accepted answer does center the icon around half of the x-height of the text next to it (as defined in the CSS specs). Which might be good enough but can look a little bit off, if the text has ascenders or descenders standing out just at top or bottom:On the left, the text is not aligned, on the right it is as shown above. A live demo can be found in this article about vertical-align.Has anyone talked about why vertical-align: top works in the scenario? The image in the question is probably taller than the text and thus defines the top edge of the line box. vertical-align: top on the span element then just positions it at the top of the line box. The main difference in behavior between vertical-align: middle and top is that the first moves elements relative to the box's baseline (which is placed wherever needed to fulfill all vertical alignments and thus feels rather unpredictable) and the second relative to the outer bounds of the line box (which is more tangible).The technique used in the accepted answer works only for single-lined text (demo), but not multi-line text (demo) - as noted there.If anyone needs to vertically center multi-lined text to an image, here are a few ways

(Methods 1 and 2 inspired by this CSS-Tricks article)CSS:CSS:CSS (The above fiddle contains vendor prefixes):This code works in IE as well as FF:Because you have to set the line-height to the height of the div for this to workBasically, you'll have to get down to CSS3.For the record, alignment "commands" shouldn't work on a SPAN, because it is an in-line tag, not a block-level tag.  Things like alignment, margin, padding, etc won't work on an in-line tag because the point of inline is not to disrupt the text flow.CSS divides HTML tags up into two groups: in-line and block-level.  Search "css block vs inline" and a great article shows up...http://www.webdesignfromscratch.com/html-css/css-block-and-inline/(Understanding core CSS principles is a key to it not being quite so annoying)Use line-height:30px for the span so that text is align with the image:Another thing you can do is set the text's line-height to the size of the images within the <div>. Then set the images to vertical-align: middle;That's seriously the easiest way.Haven't seen a solution with margin in any of these answers yet, so here is my solution to this problem.This solution only works if you know the width of your image.I generally use 3px in place of top. By increasing/decreasing that value, the image can be changed to the required height.Write these span propertiesUse display:inline-block; When you use vertical-align property.Those are assosiated propertiesYou can set image as inline element using display propertyOn a button in jQuery mobile, for instance, you can tweak it a bit by applying this style to the image:Multiline solution:http://jsfiddle.net/zH58L/6/Works in all browers and ie9+It can be confusing, I agree. Try utilizing table features. I use this simple CSS trick to position modals at the center of the webpage. It has large browser support:and CSS part:Note that you have to style and adjust the size of image and table container to make it work as you desire. Enjoy.Firstly inline CSS is not recommended at all, it really mess up your HTML.For aligning image and span, you can simply do vertical-align:middle.

There is a property called background-size which does set the size of the element, but it is CSS 3 which would conflict with Internet Explorer 7 requirements.I would advice you to either redo your browser priorities and design for the best available browsers, or get some server-side code to resize the images if you'd want to use this solution.You could do this:http://jsfiddle.net/DZ8vW/1http://jsfiddle.net/MBs64/The key property is display: table-cell; for .frame.

I recommend you check this link called Centering a block or image from W3C.org.The tips used here are:Personally I actually disagree about use helpers for this purpose.My solution: http://jsfiddle.net/XNAj6/2/This works for modern browsers (2016 at time of edit) as shown in this demo on codepenIt is very important that you either give the images a class or use inheritance to target the images that you need centered. In this example we used .frame img {} so that only images wrapped by a div with a class of .frame would be targeted.An easy way which work for me:It works for Google Chrome very well. Try this one out in a different browser.For centering an image inside a container (it could be a logo) besides some text like this:Basically you wrap the imageIf you can live with pixel-sized margins, just add font-size: 1px; to the .frame.

This works for me:You can use this:Using table and table-cell method do the job, specially because you targeting some old browsers as well, I create a snippet for you which you can run it and check the result:

I have been playing around with using padding for center alignment. You will need to define the top level outer-container size, but the inner container should resize, and you can set the padding at different percentage values.jsfiddleThe best solution is thatUse this one:And you can vary font-size.Want to align an image which have after a text / title and both are inside a div?See on JSfiddle or Run Code Snippet.Just be sure to have an ID or a class at all your elements (div, img, title, etc.).For me works this solution on all browsers (for mobile devices you must to adapt your code with: @media).

Transitions on the CSS display property

RichardTape

[Transitions on the CSS display property](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3331353/transitions-on-the-css-display-property)

I'm currently designing a CSS 'mega dropdown' menu - basically a regular CSS-only dropdown menu, but one that contains different types of content.At the moment, it appears that CSS 3 transitions don't apply to the 'display' property, i.e., you can't do any sort of transition from display: none to display: block (or any combination).Is there a way for the second-tier menu from the above example to 'fade in' when someone hovers over one of the top level menu items?I'm aware that you can use transitions on the visibility: property, but I can't think of a way to use that effectively.I've also tried using height, but that just failed miserably.I'm also aware that it's trivial to achieve this using JavaScript, but I wanted to challenge myself to use just CSS, and I think I'm coming up a little short.

I'm currently designing a CSS 'mega dropdown' menu - basically a regular CSS-only dropdown menu, but one that contains different types of content.At the moment, it appears that CSS 3 transitions don't apply to the 'display' property, i.e., you can't do any sort of transition from display: none to display: block (or any combination).Is there a way for the second-tier menu from the above example to 'fade in' when someone hovers over one of the top level menu items?I'm aware that you can use transitions on the visibility: property, but I can't think of a way to use that effectively.I've also tried using height, but that just failed miserably.I'm also aware that it's trivial to achieve this using JavaScript, but I wanted to challenge myself to use just CSS, and I think I'm coming up a little short.You can concatenate two transitions or more, and visibility is what comes handy this time.(Don't forget the vendor prefixes to the transition property.)More details are in this article.You need to hide the element by other means in order to get this to work.I accomplished the effect by positioning both <div>s absolutely and setting the hidden one to opacity: 0.If you even toggle the display property from none to block, your transition on other elements will not occur.To work around this, always allow the element to be display: block, but hide the element by adjusting any of these means:There are likely more solutions, but you cannot perform a transition if you toggle the element to display: none. For example, you may attempt to try something like this:But that will not work. From my experience, I have found this to do nothing.Because of this, you will always need to keep the element display: block - but you could get around it by doing something like this:At the time of this post all major browsers disable CSS transitions if you try to change the display property, but CSS animations still work fine so we can use them as a workaround.Example Code (you can apply it to your menu accordingly) Demo:Add the following CSS to your stylesheet:Then apply the fadeIn animation to the child on parent hover (and of course set display: block):(Some JavaScript code is required)I suspect that the reason that transitions are disabled if display is changed is because of what display actually does. It does not change anything that could conceivably be smoothly animated.display: none; and visibility: hidden; are two entirely different things.

Both do have the effect of making the element invisible, but with visibility: hidden; it’s still rendered in the layout, but just not visibly so.

The hidden element still takes up space, and is still rendered inline or as a block or block-inline or table or whatever the display element tells it to render as, and takes up space accordingly.

Other elements do not automatically move to occupy that space. The hidden element just doesn’t render its actual pixels to the output.display: none on the other hand actually prevents the element from rendering entirely.

It does not take up any layout space.

Other elements that would’ve occupied some or all of the space taken up by this element now adjust to occupy that space, as if the element simply did not exist at all.display is not just another visual attribute.

It establishes the entire rendering mode of the element, such as whether it’s a block, inline, inline-block, table, table-row, table-cell, list-item, or whatever!

Each of those have very different layout ramifications, and there would be no reasonable way to animate or smoothly transition them (try to imagine a smooth transition from block to inline or vice-versa, for instance!).This is why transitions are disabled if display changes (even if the change is to or from none — none isn’t merely invisibility, it’s its own element rendering mode that means no rendering at all!).display is not one of the properties that transition works upon.See Animatable CSS properties for the list of CSS properties that can have transitions applied to them. See CSS Values and Units Module Level 4, Combining Values: Interpolation, Addition, and Accumulation for how they are interpolated.Up to CSS 3 was listed in 9.1. Properties from CSS (just close the warning popup)Last time I had to do this, I used max-height instead, which is an animatable property (although it was a bit of a hack, it did work), but beware that it may be very janky for complex pages or users with low-end mobile devices.Instead of callbacks, which don't exist in CSS, we can use transition-delay property.So, what's going on here?Note, this approach is better than ones using visibility. In such cases, the element still occupies the space on the page, and it's not always suitable.For more examples please refer to this article.You can add a custom animation to the block property now.DemoIn this demo the sub-menu changes from display:none to display:block and still manages to fade.According to W3C Working Draft 19 November 2013 display is not an animatable property. Fortunately, visibility is animatable. You may chain its transition with a transition of opacity (JSFiddle):Note that if you just make the link transparent, without setting visibility: hidden, then it would stay clickable.My neat JavaScript trick is to separate the entire scenario into two different functions!To prepare things, one global variable is declared and one event handler is defined:Then, when hiding element, I use something like this: For reappearing the element, I am doing something like this:It works, so far!Edit: display none is not being applied in this example.What's happening above is that through 99% of the animation display is set to block while the opacity fades out. In the last moment display property is set to none.And the most important bit is to retain the last frame after the animation ends using animation-fill-mode: forwardsHere are two examples: https://jsfiddle.net/qwnz9tqg/3/I ran into this today, with a position: fixed modal that I was reusing. I couldn't keep it display: none and then animate it, as it just jumped into appearance, and and z-index (negative values, etc) did weird things as well.I was also using a height: 0 to height: 100%, but it only worked when the modal appeared. This is the same as if you used left: -100% or something.Then it struck me that there was a simple answer. Et voila:First, your hidden modal. Notice the height is 0, and check out the height declaration in transitions... it has a 500ms, which is longer than my opacity transition. Remember, this affects the out-going fade-out transition: returning the modal to its default state.Second, your visible modal. Say you're setting a .modal-active to the body. Now the height is 100%, and my transition has also changed. I want the height to be instantly changed, and the opacity to take 300ms.That's it, it works like a charm.Taking from a few of these answers and some suggestions elsewhere, the following works great for hover menus (I'm using this with Bootstrap 3, specifically):You could also use height in place of max-height if you specify both values since height:auto is not allowed with transitions. The hover value of max-height needs to be greater than the height of the menu can possibly be.I've came across this issue multiple times and now simply went with:By adding the class block--invisible the whole Elements will not be clickable but all Elements behind it will be because of the pointer-events:none which is supported by all major browsers (no IE < 11).Change overflow:hidden to overflow:visible. It works better. I use like this:visible is better because overflow:hidden act exactly like a display:none.JavaScript is not required, and no outrageously huge max-height is needed. Instead, set your max-height on your text elements, and use a font relative unit such as rem or em. This way, you can set a maximum height larger than your container, while avoiding a delay or "popping" when the menu closes:HTMLCSSSee an example here:

http://codepen.io/mindfullsilence/pen/DtzjEAfter the accepted answer from Guillermo was written, the CSS

transition specification of 2012-04-03 changed the behavior of the visibility transition and now it is possible to solve this problem in a shorter way, without the use of transition-delay:The run time specified for both transitions should usually be

identical (although a slightly longer time for visibility is not a problem).For a running version, see my blog post CSS Transition Visibility.W.r.t. the title of the question "Transitions on the display: property" and in response to comments from Rui Marques and josh to the accepted answer:This solution works in cases where it is irrelevant if the display or

visibility property is used (as it probably was the case in this question).It will not completely remove the element as display:none, just make it invisible, but it still stays in the document flow and influences the position of the following elements.Transitions that completely remove the element similar to display:none can be done using height (as indicated by other answers and comments), max-height, or margin-top/bottom, but also see

How can I transition height: 0; to height: auto; using CSS? and my blog post Workarounds for CSS Transitions on the Display and Height Properties.In response to comment from GeorgeMillo:

Both properties and both transitions are needed: The opacity property

is used to create a fade-in and fade-out animation and the visibility

property to avoid the element still reacting on mouse

events. Transitions are needed on opacity for the visual effect and on

visibility to delay hiding until the fade-out is finished.I finally found a solution for me, by combining opacity with position absolute (not to occupy space when hidden).I suspect anyone just starting CSS transitions quickly discovers that they don't work if you're modifying the display property (block/none) at the same time. One workaround that hasn't yet been mentioned is that you can continue to use display:block/none to hide/show the element, but set its opacity to 0 so that even when it's display:block, it's still invisible.Then to fade it in, add another CSS class such as "on" which sets the opacity to 1 and defines the transition for opacity. As you may have imagined, you'll have to use JavaScript to add that "on" class to the element, but at least you're still using CSS for the actual transition.P.S. If you find yourself in a situation where you need to do both display:block, and add class "on", at the same time, defer the latter using setTimeout. Otherwise, the browser just sees both things as happening at once and disables the transition.It is as simple as the following :)Get it to fade away, and then make it height 0;. Also make sure to use forwards so that it stays in the final state.I found better way for this issue, you can use CSS Animation and make your awesome effect for showing items.This solution has excellent compatibility, and I haven't seen it yet:Explanation: it uses the visibility: hidden trick (which is compatible with「show-and-animate」in one step), but it uses the combination position: absolute; z-index: -1; pointer-events: none; to make sure that the hidden container does not take space and does not answer to user interactions.You can get this to work the natural way you expected - using display - but you have to throttle the browser to get it to work, using either Javascript or as others have suggested a fancy trick with one tag inside another. I don't care for the inner tag as it further complicates CSS and dimensions, so here's the Javascript solution:https://jsfiddle.net/b9chris/hweyecu4/17/Starting with a box like:A hidden box.We're going to use a trick found in a related q/a, checking offsetHeight to throttle the browser instantaneously:https://stackoverflow.com/a/16575811/176877First, a library formalizing the above trick:Next, we're going to use it to reveal a box, and fade it in:This fades the box in and out. So, .noTrnsn() turns off transitions, then we remove the hidden class, which flips display from none to its default, block. We then set opacity to 0 to get ready for fading in. Now that we've set the stage, we turn transitions back on, with .resumeTrnsn(). And finally, kick off the transition by setting opacity to 1.Without the library, both the change to display and the change to opacity would've gotten us undesirable results. If we simply removed the library calls, we'd get no transitions at all.Note that the above does not set display to none again at the end of the fadeout animation. We can get fancier though. Let's do so with one that fades in and grows in height from 0.https://jsfiddle.net/b9chris/hweyecu4/22/We're now transitioning both height and opacity. Note that we are not setting height, which means it is the default, auto. Conventionally this cannot be transitioned - moving from auto to a pixel value (like 0) will get you no transition. We're going to work around that with the library, and one more library method:This is a convenience method that lets us participate in jQuery's existing fx/animation queue, without requiring any of the animation framework that's now excluded in jQuery 3.x. I'm not going to explain how jQuery works, but suffice to say, the .queue() and .stop() plumbing that jQuery provides help us prevent our animations from stepping on each other.Let's animate the slide down effect.This code begins by checking on #box and whether it's currently hidden, by checking on its class. But it accomplishes more using the wait() library call, by adding the hidden class at the end of the slideout/fade animation, which you'd expect to find if it is in fact hidden - something the above simpler example could not do. This happens to also enable display/hiding the element over and over, which was a bug in the previous example, because the hidden class was never restored.You can also see CSS and class changes being called after .noTrnsn() to generally set the stage for animations, including taking measurements, like measuring what will be the final height of #box without showing that to the user, before calling .resumeTrnsn(), and animating it from that fully-set stage to its goal CSS values.https://jsfiddle.net/b9chris/hweyecu4/1/You can have it transition on click with:The CSS is what you'd guess:The key is throttling the display property. By removing the hidden class and then waiting 50 ms, then starting the transition via the added class, we get it to appear and then expand like we wanted, instead of it just blipping onto the screen without any animation. Similar occurs going the other way, except we wait till the animation is over before applying hidden.Note: I'm abusing .animate(maxWidth) here to avoid setTimeout race conditions. setTimeout is quick to introduce hidden bugs when you or someone else picks up code unaware of it. .animate() can easily be killed with .stop(). I'm just using it to put a 50 ms or 2000 ms delay on the standard fx queue where it's easy to find/resolve by other coders building on top of this.I had a similar issue that I couldn't find the answer to. A few Google searches later led me here. Considering I didn't find the simple answer I was hoping for, I stumbled upon a solution that is both elegant and effective.It turns out the visibility CSS property has a value collapse which is generally used for table items. However, if used on any other elements it effectively renders them as hidden, pretty much the same as display: hidden but with the added ability that the element doesn't take up any space and you can still animate the element in question.Below is a simple example of this in action.Instead of using display you could store the element 'off-screen' until you needed it, and then set its position to where you want it and transform it at the same time. This brings up a whole host of other design issues though, so your mileage may vary.You probably wouldn't want to use display anyway, as you'd want the content to be accessible to screen readers, which for the most part try to obey rules for visibility - i.e., if it shouldn't be visible to the eye, it won't show up as content to the agent.The simplest universal solution to the problem is: feel free to specify display:none in your CSS, however you will have change it to block (or whatever else) using JavaScript, and then you'll also have to add a class to your element in question that actually does the transition with setTimeout(). That's all.I.e.:This was tested in the latest sane browsers. Obviously it shouldn't work in Internet Explorer 9 or earlier.I think SalmanPK has the closest answer. It does fade an item in or out, with the following CSS animations. However, the display property does not animate smoothly, only the opacity.If you want to animate the element moving from display block to display none, I can't see that it is currently possible just with CSS. You have to get the height and use a CSS animation to decrease the height. This is possible with CSS as shown in the example below, but it would be tricky to know the exact height values you need to animate for an element.jsFiddle exampleYou can do this with transition events, so you build two CSS classes for the transition, one holding the animation other, holding the display none state. And you switch them after the animation is ended? In my case I can display the divs again if I press a button, and remove both classes.Try the snippet below...If you are using jQuery to set your classes, this will work 100%:Of course you could just use jQuery .fadeIn() and .fadeOut() functions, but the advantage of setting classes instead is in case you want to transition to a display value other than block (as is the default with .fadeIn() and .fadeOut()).Here I am transitioning to display flex with a nice fade effect.You can simply use the CSS visibility: hidden/visible instead of display : none/blockYou can also use this:

I want to center a div vertically with CSS. I don't want tables or JavaScript, but only pure CSS. I found some solutions, but all of them are missing Internet Explorer 6 support.How can I center a div vertically in all major browsers, including Internet Explorer 6?Below is the best all-around solution I could build to vertically and horizontally center a fixed-width, flexible height content box. It was tested and working for recent versions of Firefox, Opera, Chrome, and Safari.View A Working Example With Dynamic ContentI built in some dynamic content to test the flexibility and would love to know if anyone sees any problems with it. It should work well for centered overlays also -- lightbox, pop-up, etc.One more I can't see on the list:Source: Absolute Horizontal And Vertical Centering In CSSThe simplest way would be the following 3 lines of CSS:1) position: relative;2) top: 50%;3) transform: translateY(-50%);Following is an EXAMPLE:Actually you need two div's for vertical centering. The div containing the content must have a width and height.Here is the resultNow the flexbox solution is a very easy way for modern browsers, so I recommend this for you:Edit 2020 : only use this if you need to support old browsers like IE8 (which you should refuse to do 😉). If not, use flexbox.This is the simplest method I found and I use it all the time

(jsFiddle demo here)Thank Chris Coyier from CSS Tricks for this article.Support starts with IE8.After a lot of research I finally found the ultimate solution. It works even for floated elements. View Source To center the div on a page, check the fiddle link.Another option is to use flex box, check the fiddle link.Another option is to use a CSS 3 transform:Notes

1. The parent element is given the class name.

2. Add flex vendor prefixes if required by your supported browsers.The easiest solution is below:Unfortunately — but not surprisingly — the solution is more complicated than one would wish it to be. Also unfortunately, you'll need to use additional divs around the div you want vertically centered.For standards-compliant browsers like Mozilla, Opera, Safari, etc. you need to set the outer div to be displayed as a table and the inner div to be displayed as a table-cell — which can then be vertically centered. For Internet Explorer, you need to position the inner div absolutely within the outer div and then specify the top as 50%. The following pages explain this technique well and provide some code samples too:There is also a technique to do the vertical centering using JavaScript. Vertical alignment of content with JavaScript & CSS demonstrates it.If someone cares for Internet Explorer 10 (and later) only, use flexbox:Flexbox support: http://caniuse.com/flexboxA modern way to center an element vertically would be to use flexbox.You need a parent to decide the height and a child to center.The example below will center a div to the center within your browser. What's important (in my example) is to set height: 100% to body and html and then min-height: 100% to your container.If you don't care about Internet Explorer 6 and 7, you can use a technique that involves two containers.You can add any content you want to the content box without caring about its width or height!See also this Fiddle!If you want to center both horizontally and vertically, you also need the following.See also this Fiddle!Related: Center a ImageThis is always where I go when I have to come back to this issue.For those who don't want to make the jump:An example of this in code:Using flex property of CSS.or by using display: flex; and margin: auto;show text centerUsing percentage(%) height and width.

Is there a「previous sibling」selector?

The plus sign (+) is for the next sibling.Is there an equivalent for the previous sibling?

2009-11-30 04:06:36Z

The plus sign (+) is for the next sibling.Is there an equivalent for the previous sibling?No, there is no "previous sibling" selector.On a related note, ~ is for general successor sibling (meaning the element comes after this one, but not necessarily immediately after) and is a CSS3 selector. + is for next sibling and is CSS2.1.See Adjacent sibling combinator from Selectors Level 3 and 5.7 Adjacent sibling selectors from Cascading Style Sheets Level 2 Revision 1 (CSS 2.1) Specification.I found a way to style all previous siblings (opposite of ~) that may work depending on what you need.Let's say you have a list of links and when hovering on one, all the previous ones should turn red. You can do it like this:Selectors level 4 introduces :has() (previously the subject indicator !) which will allow you to select a previous sibling with:… but at the time of writing, it is some distance beyond the bleeding edge for browser support.I'll focus on flexbox in the examples below, but the same concepts apply to Grid.With flexbox, a previous sibling selector can be simulated.In particular, the flex order property can move elements around the screen.Here's an example:STEPS...and voilà! A previous sibling selector is born (or at least simulated).Here's the full code:From the flexbox spec:The initial order value for all flex items is 0.Also see order in the CSS Grid Layout spec.Examples of "previous sibling selectors" created with the flex order property.Flexbox is shattering long-held beliefs about CSS.One such belief is that a previous sibling selector is not possible in CSS.To say this belief is widespread would be an understatement. Here's a sampling of related questions on Stack Overflow alone:As described above, this belief is not entirely true. A previous sibling selector can be simulated in CSS using the flex order property.The z-index MythAnother long-standing belief has been that z-index works only on positioned elements.In fact, the most current version of the spec – the W3C Editor's Draft – still asserts this to be true:In reality, however, this information is obsolete and inaccurate.Elements that are flex items or grid items can create stacking contexts even when position is static.Here's a demonstration of z-index working on non-positioned flex items: https://jsfiddle.net/m0wddwxs/I had the same question, but then I had a "duh" moment.   Instead of writingwrite Obviously this matches "x" instead of "y", but it answers the "is there a match?" question, and simple DOM traversal may get you to the right element more efficiently than looping in javascript.I realize that the original question was a CSS question so this answer is probably completely irrelevant, but other Javascript users may stumble on the question via search like I did.Two tricks. Basically inverting the HTML order of your desired elements in HTML and using

Then besides using order as in Michael_B's answer you can use flex-direction: row-reverse; or flex-direction: column-reverse; depending on your layout.Working sample:There is no official way to do that at the moment but you can use a little trick to achieve this ! Remember that it is experimental and it has some limitation ...

(check this link if you worries about navigator compatibility )What you can do is use a CSS3 selector : the pseudo classe called nth-child()If you know the exact position an :nth-child()-based exclusion of all following siblings would work.Which would select all lis before the 3rd (e.g. 1st and 2nd). But, in my opinion this looks ugly and has a very tight usecase.You also could select the nth-child right-to-left:Which does the same.There is no "previous" sibling selector unfortunately, but you can possibly still get the same effect by using positioning (e.g. float right). It depends on what you are trying to do.In my case, I wanted a primarily CSS 5-star rating system. I would need to color (or swap the icon of) the previous stars. By floating each element right, I am essentially getting the same effect (the html for the stars thus must be written 'backwards').I'm using FontAwesome in this example and swapping between the unicodes of fa-star-o and fa-star

    JSFiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/andrewleyva/88j0105g/No. It is not possible via CSS. It takes the "Cascade" to heart ;-).However, if you are able to add JavaScript to your page, a little bit of jQuery could get you to your end goal.

You can use jQuery's find to perform a "look-ahead" on your target element/class/id, then backtrack to select your target.

Then you use jQuery to re-write the DOM (CSS) for your element.Based on this answer by Mike Brant,

the following jQuery snippet could help.This first selects all <ul>s that immediately follow a <p>.

Then it "backtracks" to select all the previous <p>s from that set of <ul>s.Effectively, "previous sibling" has been selected via jQuery.

Now, use the .css function to pass in your CSS new values for that element.In my case I was looking to find a way to select a DIV with the id #full-width, but ONLY if it had a (indirect) descendant DIV with the class of .companies.I had control of all the HTML under .companies, but could not alter any of the HTML above it.

And the cascade goes only 1 direction: down.Thus I could select ALL #full-widths.

Or I could select .companies that only followed a #full-width.

But I could not select only #full-widths that proceeded .companies.And, again, I was unable to add .companies any higher up in the HTML.  That part of the HTML was written externally, and wrapped our code.But with jQuery, I can select the required #full-widths, then assign the appropriate style:  This finds all #full-width .companies, and selects just those .companies, similar to how selectors are used to target specific elements in standard in CSS.

Then it uses .parents to "backtrack" and select ALL parents of .companies,

but filters those results to keep only #fill-width elements, so that in the end,

it only selects a #full-width element if it has a .companies class descendant.

Finally, it assigns a new CSS (width) value to the resulting element.jQuery Reference Docs:

$() or jQuery(): DOM element.

.find: Get the descendants of each element in the current set of matched elements, filtered by a selector, jQuery object, or element.

.parents: Get the immediately preceding sibling of each element in the set of matched elements. If a selector is provided, it retrieves the previous sibling only if it matches that selector (filters the results to only include the listed elements/selectors).

.css: Set one or more CSS properties for the set of matched elements.   Depending on your exact objective, there is a way to achieve the usefulness of a parent selector without using one (even if one were to exist)...Say we have:What can we do to make the Socks block (including sock colours) stand out visually using spacing?What would be nice but doesn't exist:What does exist:This sets all anchor links to have 15px margin on the top and resets it back to 0 for those with no UL elements (or other tags) inside LIs.I needed a solution to select the previous sibling tr. I came up with this solution using React and Styled-components. This is not my exact solution (This is from memory, hours later). I know there is a flaw in the setHighlighterRow function.OnMouseOver a row will set the row index to state, and rerender the previous row with a new background color I had a similar problem and found out that all problem of this nature can be solved as follows:and this way you'll be able to style your current, previous items(all items overridden with current and next items) and your next items.example:Hope it helps someone.This is what I used by using jQueryThis is how will get the working codes:

Is there a CSS-only way to style a <select> dropdown?I need to style a <select> form as much as humanly possible, without any JavaScript. What are the properties I can use to do so in CSS?This code needs to be compatible with all major browsers:I know I can make it with JavaScript: Example.And I'm not talking about simple styling. I want to know, what the best we can do with CSS only.I found similar questions on Stack Overflow.And this one on Doctype.com.Here are three solutions:Solution #1 - appearance: none   - with Internet Explorer 10 - 11 workaround (Demo)--To hide the default arrow set appearance: none on the select element, then add your own custom arrow with background-imageBrowser Support:appearance: none has very good browser support (caniuse) - except for Internet Explorer 11 (and later) and Firefox 34 (and later).We can improve this technique and add support for Internet Explorer 10 and Internet Explorer 11 by addingIf Internet Explorer 9 is a concern, we have no way of removing the default arrow (which would mean that we would now have two arrows), but, we could use a funky Internet Explorer 9 selector.To at least undo our custom arrow - leaving the default select arrow intact.This solution is easy and has good browser support - it should generally suffice.If browser support for Internet Explorer 9 (and later) and Firefox 34  (and later) is necessary then keep reading...Solution #2 Truncate the select element to hide the default arrow (demo)--(Read more here)Wrap the select element in a div with a fixed width and overflow:hidden.Then give the select element a width of about 20 pixels greater than the div.The result is that the default drop-down arrow of the select element will be hidden (due to the overflow:hidden on the container), and you can place any background image you want on the right-hand-side of the div.The advantage of this approach is that it is cross-browser (Internet Explorer 8 and later, WebKit, and Gecko). However, the disadvantage of this approach is that the options drop-down juts out on the right-hand-side (by the 20 pixels which we hid... because the option elements take the width of the select element).[It should be noted, however, that if the custom select element is necessary only for mobile devices - then the above problem doesn't apply - because of the way each phone natively opens the select element. So for mobile, this may be the best solution.]If the custom arrow is necessary on Firefox - prior to Version 35 - but you don't need to support old versions of Internet Explorer - then keep reading...Solution #3 - Use the pointer-events property (demo)--(Read more here)The idea here is to overlay an element over the native drop down arrow (to create our custom one) and then disallow pointer events on it.Advantage: It works well in WebKit and Gecko. It looks good too (no jutting out option elements).Disadvantage: Internet Explorer (Internet Explorer 10 and down) doesn't support pointer-events, which means you can't click the custom arrow. Also, another (obvious) disadvantage with this method is that you can't target your new arrow image with a hover effect or hand cursor, because we have just disabled pointer events on them!However, with this method you can use Modernizer or conditional comments to make Internet Explorer revert to the standard built in arrow.NB: Being that Internet Explorer 10 doesn't support conditional comments anymore: If you want to use this approach, you should probably use Modernizr. However, it is still possible to exclude the pointer-events CSS from Internet Explorer 10 with a CSS hack described here.It is possible, but unfortunately mostly in WebKit-based browsers to the extent we, as developers, require. Here is the example of CSS styling gathered from Chrome options panel via built-in developer tools inspector, improved to match currently supported CSS properties in most modern browsers:When you run this code on any page within a WebKit-based browser it should change the appearance of the select box, remove standard OS-arrow and add a PNG-arrow, put some spacing before and after the label, almost anything you want.The most important part is appearance property, which changes how the element behaves.It works perfectly in almost all WebKit-based browser, including mobile ones, though Gecko doesn't support appearance as well as WebKit, it seems.The select element and its dropdown feature are difficult to style.style attributes for select element by Chris Heilmann confirms what Ryan Dohery said in a comment to the first answer:The largest inconsistency I've noticed when styling select dropdowns is Safari and Google Chrome rendering (Firefox is fully customizable through CSS). After some searching through obscure depths of the Internet I came across the following, which nearly completely resolves my qualms with WebKit:Safari and Google Chrome fix:This does, however, remove the dropdown arrow. You can add a dropdown arrow using a nearby div with a background, negative margin or absolutely positioned over the select dropdown.*More information and other variables are available in CSS property: -webkit-appearance.I had this exact problem, except I couldn't use images and was not limited by browser support. This should be «on spec» and with luck start working everywhere eventually.It uses layered rotated background layers to «cut out» a dropdown arrow, as pseudo-elements wouldn't work for the select element.Edit: In this updated version I am using CSS variables and a tiny theming system.<select> tags can be styled through CSS just like any other HTML element on an HTML page rendered in a browser. Below is an (overly simple) example that will position a select element on the page and render the text of the options in blue.Example HTML file (selectExample.html):Example CSS file (selectExample.css):The blog post How to CSS form drop down style no JavaScript works for me, but it fails in Opera though:Here is a version that works in all modern browsers. The key is using appearance:none which removes the default formatting. Since all of the formatting is gone, you have to add back in the arrow that visually differentiates the select from the input.Working example: https://jsfiddle.net/gs2q1c7p/I got to your case using Bootstrap. This is the simplest solution that works:Note: the base64 stuff is fa-chevron-down in SVG.In modern browsers it's relatively painless to style the <select> in CSS. With appearance: none the only tricky part is replacing the arrow (if that's what you want). Here's a solution that uses an inline data: URI with plain-text SVG:The rest of the styling (borders, padding, colors, etc.) is fairly straightforward.This works in all the browsers I just tried (Firefox 50, Chrome 55, Edge 38, and Safari 10). One note about Firefox is that if you want to use the # character in the data URI (e.g. fill: #000) you need to escape it (fill: %23000).Use the clip property to crop the borders and the arrow of the select element, then add your own replacement styles to the wrapper:Use a second select with zero opacity to make the button clickable:Coordinates differ between Webkit and other browsers, but a @media query can cover that.ReferencesEdit this element is not recommended, but if you want to try it's like any other HTML element.Edit example:Tested in Internet Explorer (10 and 11), Edge, Firefox, and ChromeThis uses a background color for select elements and I removed the image..A very nice example that uses :after and :before to do the trick is in Styling Select Box with CSS3 | CSSDeckYes.  You may style any HTML element by its tag name, like this:Of course, you can also use a CSS class to style it, like any other element:Here's a solution based on my favorite ideas from this discussion. This allows styling a <select> element directly without any additional markup.It works Internet Explorer 10 (and later) with a safe fallback for Internet Explorer 8/9. One caveat for these browsers is that the background image must be positioned and be small enough to hide behind the native expand control.http://codepen.io/ralgh/pen/gpgbGxAs of Internet Explorer 10, you can use the ::-ms-expand pseudo element selector to style, and hide, the drop down arrow element. The remaining styling should be similar to other browsers.Here is a basic fork of Danield's jsfiddle that applies support for IE10Check this fiddle, and forgive me the overstyling: https://jsfiddle.net/dkellner/7ac9us70/The trick behind: as soon as the <select> tag gets a property called "size", it will behave as a fixed-height list, and, suddenly, for some reason, allows you to style the hell out of it. Now strictly speaking, the fixed list is a side effect - but it just helps us more because we use it for the "dropped-down look".A minimal example:(to keep it simple I did it with jQuery - but you can do the same without it)

You definitely should do it like in Styling select, optgroup and options with CSS. In many ways, background-color and color are just what you would typically need to style options, not the entire select.You can also add a hover style to the dropdown.The third method in Danield's answer can be improved to work with hover-effects and other mouse events. Just make sure that the "button"-element comes right after the select element in the markup. Then target it using the + CSS selector:This will, however, show the hover effect when hovering anywhere over the select-element, not just over the "button".I'm using this method in combination with Angular (since my project happens to be an Angular application anyway), to cover the whole select-element, and let Angular display the text of the selected option in the "button"-element. In this case it makes perfect sense that the hover-effect applies when hovering anywhere over the select.It doesn't work without JavaScript though, so if you want to do this, and your site has to work without JavaScript, you should make sure that your script adds the elements and classes necessary for the enhancement. That way, a browser without JavaScript will simply get a normal, unstyled, select, instead of a styled badge that doesn't update correctly.A CSS and HTML only solutionIt seems compatible with Chrome, Firefox, and Internet Explorer 11. But please leave your feedback regarding other web browsers.As suggested by Danield's answer, I wrap my select in a div (even two divs for x-browser compatibility) to get the expected behavior.See http://jsfiddle.net/bjap2/HTML:Notice the two div wrappers.Also notice the extra div added to place the arrow-down button wherever you like (positioned absolutely), here we put it on the left.

When I tried it I had problems with dropdown menus appearing below the content.  It's just not pretty.Honestly, for vertical centering issues and, well, any vertical alignment issues with the items aren't fixed height, it's easier just to use tables.Example: Can you do this HTML layout without using tables?Use CSS positioning:As cletus noted, you need identify the header-content to make this work.I use these properties and it works!If you're not worried about legacy browsers use a flexbox.The parent element needs its display type set to flexThen you set the child element's align-self to flex-end.Here's the resource I used to learn:

http://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/After struggling with this same issue for some time, I finally figured out a solution that meets all of my requirements:The solution just takes one <div>, which I call the "aligner":CSShtmlThis trick works by creating a tall, skinny div, which pushes the text baseline to the bottom of the container.Here is a complete example that achieves what the OP was asking for.  I've made the "bottom_aligner" thick and red for demonstration purposes only.CSS:HTML:The modern way to do it would be using flexbox. See the example below. You don't even need to wrap Some text... into any HTML tag, since text directly contained in a flex container is wrapped in an anonymous flex item.If there is only some text and you want to align vertically to the bottom of the container.Inline or inline-block elements can be aligned to the bottom of block level elements if the line-height of the parent/block element is greater than that of the inline element.*markup:css:*make sure you're in standards modeYou can simply achieved flexIf you have multiple, dynamic height items, use the CSS display values of table and table-cell:HTMLCSSI've created a JSBin demo here: http://jsbin.com/INOnAkuF/2/editThe demo also has an example how to vertically center align using the same technique.Here is another solution using flexbox but without using flex-end for bottom alignment. The idea is to set margin-bottom on h1 to auto to push the remaining content to the bottom:We can also do the same with margin-top:auto on the text but in this case we need to wrap it inside a div or span:You don't need absolute+relative for this. It is very much possible using relative position for both container and data. This is how you do it.Assume height of your data is going to be x. Your container is relative and footer is also relative. All you have to do is add to your dataYour data will always be at the bottom of your container. Works even if you have container with dynamic height.HTML will be like thisCSS will be like thisLive example hereHope this helps. Here's the flexy way to do it. Of course, it's not supported by IE8, as the user needed 7 years ago. Depending on what you need to support, some of these can be done away with.Still, it would be nice if there was a way to do this without an outer container, just have the text align itself within it's own self.a very simple, one-line solution, is to add line-heigth to the div, having in mind that all the div's text will go bottom.CSS:HTML:keep in mind that this is a practical and fast solution when you just want text inside div to go down, if you need to combine images and stuff, you will have to code a bit more complex and responsive CSSif you could set the height of the wrapping div of the content (#header-content as shown in other's reply), instead of the entire #header, maybe you can also try this approach:HTMLCSSshow on codepenSeems to be working:HTML:

    I'm at the bottomcss:All these answers and none worked for me... I'm no flexbox expert, but this was reasonably easy to figure out, it is simple and easy to understand and use. To separate something from the rest of the content, insert an empty div and let it grow to fill the space.https://jsfiddle.net/8sfeLmgd/1/This reacts as expected when the bottom content is not fixed sized also when the container is not fixed sized.I have devised a way which is a lot simpler than what's  been mentioned.Set the height of the header div. Then inside that, style your H1 tag as follows:I'm working on a site for a client, and the design requires the text to be at the bottom of a certain div. I've achieved the result using these two lines, and it works fine. Also, if the text does expand, the padding will still remain the same.I found this solution bassed on a default bootstrap start templatetry with:try changing the % to fix it. Example: 120% or 90% ...etc.The site I just did for a client requested that the footer text was a high box, with the text at the bottom I achieved this with simple padding, should work for all browsers.A perfect cross-browser example is probably this one here:http://www.csszengarden.com/?cssfile=/213/213.css&page=0The idea is both to display the div at the bottom and also making it stick there. Often the simple approach will make the sticky div scroll up with the main content.Following is a fully working minimal example. Note that there's no div embedding trickery required. The many BRs are just to force a scrollbar to appear:If you are wondering your code might not be working on IE, remember to add the DOCTYPE tag at the top. It's crucial for this to work on IE. Also, this should be the first tag and nothing should appear above it.Seems to be working:Using less makes solving CSS puzzles much more like coding than like... I just love CSS.

offsetting an html anchor to adjust for fixed header [duplicate]

[offsetting an html anchor to adjust for fixed header [duplicate]](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10732690/offsetting-an-html-anchor-to-adjust-for-fixed-header)

I am trying to clean up the way my anchors work. I have a header that is fixed to the top of the page, so when you link to an anchor elsewhere in the page, the page jumps so the anchor is at the top of the page, leaving the content behind the fixed header (I hope that makes sense).  I need a way to offset the anchor by the 25px from the height of the header. I would prefer HTML or CSS, but Javascript would be acceptable as well.

I am trying to clean up the way my anchors work. I have a header that is fixed to the top of the page, so when you link to an anchor elsewhere in the page, the page jumps so the anchor is at the top of the page, leaving the content behind the fixed header (I hope that makes sense).  I need a way to offset the anchor by the 25px from the height of the header. I would prefer HTML or CSS, but Javascript would be acceptable as well.You could just use CSS without any javascript.Give your anchor a class:You can then position the anchor an offset higher or lower than where it actually appears on the page, by making it a block element and relatively positioning it. -250px will position the anchor up 250pxI found this solution:This doesn't create any gap in the content and anchor links works really nice.As this is a concern of presentation, a pure CSS solution would be ideal. However, this question was posed in 2012, and although relative positioning / negative margin solutions have been suggested, these approaches seem rather hacky, create potential flow issues, and cannot respond dynamically to changes in the DOM / viewport.With that in mind I believe that using JavaScript is still (February 2017) the best approach. Below is a vanilla-JS solution which will respond both to anchor clicks and resolve the page hash on load (See JSFiddle). Modify the .getFixedOffset() method if dynamic calculations are required. If you're using jQuery, here's a modified solution with better event delegation and smooth scrolling.I was looking for a solution to this as well. In my case, it was pretty easy.I have a list menu with all the links:And below that the headings where it should go to.Now because I have a fixed menu at the top of my page I can't just make it go to my  tag because that would be behind the menu.Instead, I put a span tag inside my  tag with the proper id.Now use 2 lines of CSS to position them properly.Change the top value to match the height of your fixed header (or more).

Now I assume this would work with other elements as well.FWIW this worked for me:Pure css solution inspired by Alexander Savin:Optionally you may want to add the following if the target is still off the screen:This takes many elements from previous answers and combines into a tiny (194 bytes minified) anonymous jQuery function.  Adjust fixedElementHeight for the height of your menu or blocking element.If you don't like the animation, replacewith:Uglified version:My solution combines the target and before selectors for our CMS. Other techniques don't account for text in the anchor. Adjust the height and the negative margin to the offset you need...I had been facing a similar issue, unfortunately after implementing all the solutions above, I came to the following conclusion.I wrote this simple scrolling js, that accounts for the offset caused due to the header and relocated the div about 125 pixels below. Please use it as you see fit.The HTMLThe JavaScriptSee a live implementation here.For modern browsers, just add the CSS3 :target selector to the page. This will apply to all the anchors automatically.That will append a pseudo-element before every a-tag with an id. Adjust values to match the height of your header.As @moeffju suggests, this can be achieved with CSS. The issue I ran into (which I'm surprised I haven't seen discussed) is the trick of overlapping previous elements with padding or a transparent border prevents hover and click actions at the bottom of those sections because the following one comes higher in the z-order.The best fix I found was to place section content in a div that is at z-index: 1:Solutions with changing position property are not always possible (it can destroy layout) therefore I suggest this:HTML:CSS:Use this:to minimize overlapping, and set font-size to 1px. Empty anchor will not work in some browsers.For the same issue, I used an easy solution : put a padding-top of 40px on each anchor.Borrowing some of the code from an answer given at this link (no author is specified), you can include a nice smooth-scroll effect to the anchor, while making it stop at -60px above the anchor, fitting nicely underneath the fixed bootstrap navigation bar (requires jQuery):I ran into this same issue and ended up handling the click events manually, like:Scroll animation optional, of course.The above methods don't work very well if your anchor is a table element or within a table (row or cell).I had to use javascript and bind to the window hashchange event to work around this (demo):* Note: The hashchange event is not available in all browsers.Instead of having a fixed-position navbar which is underlapped by the rest of the content of the page (with the whole page body being scrollable), consider instead having a non-scrollable body with a static navbar and then having the page content in an absolutely-positioned scrollable div below.That is, have HTML like this...... and CSS like this:This achieves the desired result in a straightforward, non-hacky way. The only difference in behaviour between this and some of the clever CSS hacks suggested above are that the scrollbar (in browsers that render one) will be attached to the content div rather than the whole height of the page. You may or may not consider this desirable.Here's a JSFiddle demonstrating this in action.You can achieve this without an ID using the a[name]:not([href]) css selector. This simply looks for links with a name and no href e.g. <a name="anc1"></a>An example rule might be:This was inspired by the answer by Shouvik - same concept as his, only the size of the fixed header isn't hard coded. As long as your fixed header is in the first header node, this should "just work"I'm facing this problem in a TYPO3 website, where all "Content Elements" are wrapped with something like:and i changed the rendering so it renders like this:And this CSS:The fixed topbar being 40px high, now the anchors work again and start 10px under the topbar.Only drawback of this technique is you can no longer use :target. Adding to Ziav's answer (with thanks to Alexander Savin), I need to be using the old-school <a name="...">...</a> as we're using <div id="...">...</div> for another purpose in our code. I had some display issues using display: inline-block -- the first line of every <p> element was turning out to be slightly right-indented (on both Webkit and Firefox browsers). I ended up trying other display values and display: table-caption works perfectly for me.I added 40px-height .vspace element holding the anchor before each of my h1 elements.In the CSS:It's working great and the space is not chocking.how about hidden span tags with linkable IDs that provide the height of the navbar:heres the fiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/N6f2f/7You can also add an anchor with follow attr:and give the parent container a position relative.Works perfect for me.A further twist to the excellent answer from @Jan is to incorporate this into the #uberbar fixed header, which uses jQuery (or MooTools). (http://davidwalsh.name/persistent-header-opacity)I've tweaked the code so the the top of the content is always below not under the fixed header and also added the anchors from @Jan again making sure that the anchors are always positioned below the fixed header.The CSS:The jQuery (including tweaks to both the #uberbar and the anchor approaches:And finally the HTML:Maybe this is useful to somebody who likes the #uberbar fading dixed header!@AlexanderSavin's solution works great in WebKit browsers for me.I additionally had to use :target pseudo-class which applies style to the selected anchor to adjust padding in FF, Opera & IE9:Note that this style is not for Chrome / Safari so you'll probably have to use css-hacks, conditional comments etc.Also I'd like to notice that Alexander's solution works due to the fact that targeted element is inline. If you don't want link you could simply change display property:Here's the solution that we use on our site. Adjust the headerHeight variable to whatever your header height is. Add the js-scroll class to the anchor that should scroll on click.

If you do Element.offsetWidth - Element.clientWidth, the exact scrollbar width will show up.JavaScript Working FiddleUsing Position: absolute,Working FiddleJavaScript Working FiddleBased on this answer, I created a simple scroll plugin.It is easy in WebKit, with optional styling:This works for me with simple CSS properties:For older versions of Firefox, use: overflow: -moz-scrollbars-none;UPDATE:Firefox now supports hiding scrollbars with CSS, so all major browsers are now covered (Chrome, Firefox, Internet Explorer, Safari, etc.).Simply apply the following CSS to the element you want to remove scrollbars from:This is the least hacky cross browser solution that I'm currently aware of. Check out the demo.ORIGINAL ANSWER:Here's another way that hasn't been mentioned yet. It's really simple and only involves two divs and CSS. No JavaScript or proprietary CSS is needed, and it works in all browsers. It doesn't require explicitly setting the width of the container either, thus making it fluid.This method uses a negative margin to move the scrollbar out of the parent and then the same amount of padding to push the content back to its original position. The technique works for vertical, horizontal and two way scrolling.Demos:Example code for the vertical version:HTML:CSS:Use:This is a trick to somewhat overlap the scrollbar with an overlapping div which doesn't have any scroll bars:This is only for WebKit browsers...

Or you could use browser-specific CSS content (if there is any in future). Every browser could have a different and specific property for their respective bars.For Microsoft Edge use: -ms-overflow-style: -ms-autohiding-scrollbar; or -ms-overflow-style: none; as per MSDN.There is no equivalent for Firefox.

Although there is a jQuery plugin to achieve this,

http://manos.malihu.gr/tuts/jquery_custom_scrollbar.htmlThis answer doesn't include the code, so here is the solution from page:According to the page this approach doesn't need to know the width of the scrollbar ahead of time in order to work and the solution works for all browsers too, and can be seen here.The good thing is that you are not forced to use padding or width differences to hide the scrollbar.This is also zoom safe. Padding/width solutions show the scrollbar when zoomed to minimum.Firefox fix: http://jsbin.com/mugiqoveko/1/edit?outputJust use following three lines and your problem will be solved:Where liaddshapes is the name of the div where scroll is coming.This works for me cross-browser.

(tested in Internet Explorer and Firefox).As of December 11th 2018 (Firefox 64 and above), the answer to this question is very simple indeed as Firefox 64+ now implements the CSS Scrollbar Styling spec.Just use the following CSS:Firefox 64 release note link here.Use:UseCall these functions for any point you want to load or unload or reload the scrollbars. It is still scrollable in Chrome as I tested it in Chrome, but I am not sure of the other browsers.This works for me: On modern browsers you can use wheel event:My problem: I don't want any style in my HTML content. I want my body directly scrollable without any scrollbar, and only a vertical scroll, working with CSS grids for any screen size.The box-sizing value impact padding or margin solutions, they works with box-sizing:content-box.I still need the "-moz-scrollbars-none" directive, and like gdoron and Mr_Green, I had to hide the scrollbar. I tried -moz-transform and -moz-padding-start, to impact only Firefox, but there was responsive side effects that needed too much work.This solution works for HTML body content with "display: grid" style, and it is responsive.Adding padding to an inner div, as in the currently accepted answer, won't work if for some reason you want to use box-model: border-box.What does work in both cases is increasing the width of the inner div to 100% plus the scrollbar's width (assuming overflow: hidden on the outer div).For example, in CSS:In JavaScript, cross-browser:This is how I do it for horizontal scroll; only CSS and works well with frameworks like Bootstrap / col-*. It only needs two extra divs and the parent with a width or max-width set:You can select the text to make it scroll or scroll it with fingers if you have a touchscreen.Short version for lazy people:I happen to try the above solutions in my project and for some reason I was not able to hide the scroll bar due to div positioning.  Hence, I decided to hide the scroll bar by introducing a div that covers it superficially.  Example below is for a horizontal scroll bar:Corresponding CSS is as follows:This will be at the body:And this is the CSS:This is a divitis-esque solution which nontheless should work for all browsers...The markup is as follows and needs to be inside something with relative positioning (and its width should be set, for example 400 pixels):The CSS:The perfect-scrollbar plugin seems to be the way to go, see: https://github.com/noraesae/perfect-scrollbarIt is a well-documented and complete JavaScript-based solution for the scrollbars issue.Demo page: http://noraesae.github.io/perfect-scrollbar/Another sort of hacky approach is to do overflow-y: hidden and then manually scroll the element with something like this:There's a great article about how to detect and deal with onmousewheel events in deepmikoto's blog.

This might work for you, but it is definitively not an elegant solution.I just wanted to share a combined snippet for hiding the scrollbar that I use when developing.

Bonus: this works even if the child is bigger than the parent.You can also center it vertically with this (and again, width and height of parent and child can be totally flexible (and/or unknown)):Keep in mind that you might need transform vendor prefixed as well.

It works in IE8. It does not work in Safari 5, but it does work in Safari 6. Safari 5 is nearly a dead browser (0.33%, August 2015).Most of the possible issues with relative font sizes are not complicated to fix.However, while this is a reasonable solution if you specifically need a CSS only fix, it's not what I recommend if you're free to change your HTML (as most of us are).This is what I, as a reasonably experienced web developer, actually do to solve this problem:Yes, that's right. I remove the whitespace in the HTML between the inline-block elements.It's easy. It's simple. It works everywhere. It's the pragmatic solution.You do sometimes have to carefully consider where whitespace will come from. Will appending another element with JavaScript add whitespace? No, not if you do it properly.Let's go on a magical journey of different ways to remove the whitespace, with some new HTML:Now that I've gone and bored you to death with "one thousand different ways to remove whitespace, by thirtydot", hopefully you've forgotten all about font-size: 0.Alternatively, you can now use flexbox to achieve many of the layouts that you may previously have used inline-block for: https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/For CSS3 conforming browsers there is white-space-collapsing:discard see: http://www.w3.org/TR/2010/WD-css3-text-20101005/#white-space-collapsingOK, although I've upvoted both the font-size: 0; and the not implemented CSS3 feature answers, 

after trying I found out that none of them is a real solution.Actually, there is not even one workaround without strong side effects.Then I decided to remove the spaces (this answers is about this argument) between the inline-block divs from my HTML source (JSP),

turning this:to thisthat is ugly, but working.But, wait a minute... what if I'm generating my divs inside Taglibs loops (Struts2, JSTL, etc...) ? For example:It is absolutely not thinkable to inline all that stuff, it would meanthat is not readable, hard to mantain and understand, etc...The solution i found: This way you will have a readable and correctly indented code.And, as a positive side effect, the HTML source, although infested by empty comments, 

will result correctly indented; let's take the first example. In my humble opinion, this:is better than this:Add comments between elements to NOT have a white space. For me it is easier than resetting font size to zero and then setting it back.All the space elimination techniques for display:inline-block are nasty hacks...  Use Flexbox It's awesome, solves all this inline-block layout bs, and as of 2017 has 98% browser support (more if you don't care about old IEs). This is the same answer I gave over on the related: Display: Inline block - What is that space?There’s actually a really simple way to remove whitespace from inline-block that’s both easy and semantic. It’s called a custom font with zero-width spaces, which allows you to collapse the whitespace (added by the browser for inline elements when they're on separate lines) at the font level using a very tiny font. Once you declare the font, you just change the font-family on the container and back again on the children, and voila. Like this:Suit to taste. Here’s a download to the font I just cooked up in font-forge and converted with FontSquirrel webfont generator. Took me all of 5 minutes. The css @font-face declaration is included: zipped zero-width space font. It's in Google Drive so you'll need to click File > Download to save it to your computer. You'll probably need to change the font paths as well if you copy the declaration to your main css file.Add display: flex; to the parent element. Here is the solution with a prefix:Simplified version 👇Two more options based on CSS Text Module Level 3 (instead of white-space-collapsing:discard which had been dropped from the spec draft):In theory, it should do exactly what is needed — shorten whitespaces

    between 'words' by the 100% of the space character width, i.e. to

    zero. But seems not to work anywhere, unfortunately, and this

    feature is marked 'at risk' (it can be dropped from the specification, too).It shortens the inter-word spaces by the width of the digit '0'. In a monospace font it should be exactly equal to the width of the space character (and any other character as well). This works in Firefox 10+, Chrome 27+, and almost works in Internet Explorer 9+.FiddleUnfortunately, it is 2019 and white-space-collapse is still not implemented.In the meantime, give the parent element font-size: 0; and set the font-size on the children. This should do the trickUse flexbox and do a fallback (from suggestions above) for older browsers:Simple:There is no need to touch the parent element.Only condition here: the item's font-size must not be defined (must be equal to parent's font-size).0.25em is the default word-spacingW3Schools - word-spacing propertyfont-size:0; can be a bit trickier to manage...I think the following couple lines is a lot better and more re-usable, and time saver than any other methods. I personally use this:Then you can use it as following...As far I as I know (I may be wrong) but all browsers support this method.EXPLANATION:This works (maybe -3px may be better) exactly as you would anticipate it to work.You will NOT have the need to go back to the css, and add another css rule, for your new inline blocks.Solving two issues at once.Also note the > (greater than sign) this means that */all children should be inline-block.http://jsfiddle.net/fD5u3/NOTE: I have modified to accommodate to inherit letter-spacing when a wrapper has a child wrapper.Though, technically not an answer to the question:

"How do I remove the space between inline-block elements?"You can try the flexbox solution and apply the code below and the space will be remove.You can learn more about it on this link: https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/I'm not pretty sure if you want to make two blue spans without a gap or want to handle other white-space, but if you want to remove the gap:And done.I had this problem right now and from font-size:0; I've found that in Internet Explorer 7 the problem remains because Internet Explorer thinks "Font Size 0?!?! WTF are you crazy man?" - So, in my case I've Eric Meyer's CSS reset and with font-size:0.01em; I have a difference of 1 pixel from Internet Explorer 7 to Firefox 9, so, I think this can be a solution.Generally we use elements like this in different lines, but in case of display:inline-block using tags in same line will remove the space, but in a different line will not.An example with tags in a different line:Example with tags in same lineAnother efficient method is a CSS job that is using font-size:0 to the parent element and give font-size to a child element as much as you want.I’ve been tackling this recently and instead of setting the parent font-size:0 then setting the child back to a reasonable value, I’ve been getting consistent results by setting the parent container letter-spacing:-.25em then the child back to letter-spacing:normal.In an alternate thread I saw a commenter mention that font-size:0 isn’t always ideal because people can control minimum font sizes in their browsers, completely negating the possibility of setting the font-size to zero.Using ems appears to work regardless of whether the font-size specified is 100%, 15pt or 36px.http://cdpn.io/dKIjoI think there is a very simple/old method for this which is supported by all browsers even IE 6/7. We could simply set letter-spacing to a large negative value in parent and then set it back to normal at child elements:The simplest answer to this question is to add.csscodepen link: http://jsfiddle.net/dGHFV/3560/With PHP brackets:I'm going to expand on user5609829's answer a little bit as I believe the other solutions here are too complicated/too much work.  Applying a margin-right: -4px to the inline block elements will remove the spacing and is supported by all browsers.  See the updated fiddle here.  For those concerned with using negative margins, try giving this a read. The CSS Text Module Level 4 specification defines a text-space-collapse property, which allow to control the how white space inside and around an element is processed.So, regarding your example, you would just have to write this:Unfortunately, no browser is implementing this property yet (as of September 2016) as mentioned in the comments to the answer of HBP.Add white-space: nowrap to the container element:CSS:HTML:Here is the Plunker.There are lots of solutions like font-size:0,word-spacing,margin-left,letter-spacing and so on.Normally I prefer using letter-spacing becauseSo, letter-spacing seems to be the best choice.However, I have to warn you when you using letter-spacing you had better using -0.3em or -0.31em not others.If you are using Chrome(test version 66.0.3359.139) or Opera(test version 53.0.2907.99), what you see might be:If you are using Firefox(60.0.2),IE10 or Edge, what you see might be:That's interesting. So, I checked the mdn-letter-spacing and found this:It seems that this is the reason.Add letter-spacing:-4px; on parent p css and add letter-spacing:0px; to your span css. I thought I'd add something new to this question as although many of the answers currently provided are more than adequate & relevant, there are some new CSS properties which can achieve a very clean output, with full support across all browsers, and little to no 'hacks'. This does move away from inline-block but it gives you the same results as the question asked for.These CSS properties are gridCSS Grid is highly supported (CanIUse) apart from IE which only needs an -ms- prefix to allow for it to work.CSS Grid is also highly flexible, and takes all the good parts from table, flex, and inline-block elements and brings them into one place.When creating a grid you can specify the gaps between the rows and columns. The default gap is already set to 0px but you can change this value to whatever you like. To cut it a bit short, heres a relevant working example:One another way I found is applying margin-left as negative values except the first element of the row.Every question, that try to remove the space between inline-blocks seems like a <table> to me...Try something like this:I found a pure CSS solution that worked for me very well in all browsers:

Is there any way to select/manipulate CSS pseudo-elements such as ::before and ::after (and the old version with one semi-colon) using jQuery?For example, my stylesheet has the following rule:How can I change 'foo' to 'bar' using jQuery?You could also pass the content to the pseudo element with a data attribute and then use jQuery to manipulate that:In HTML:In jQuery:In CSS: If you want to prevent the 'other text' from showing up, you could combine this with seucolega's solution like this:In HTML:In jQuery:In CSS: You'd think this would be a simple question to answer, with everything else that jQuery can do. Unfortunately, the problem comes down to a technical issue: css :after and :before rules aren't part of the DOM, and therefore can't be altered using jQuery's DOM methods.There are ways to manipulate these elements using JavaScript and/or CSS workarounds; which one you use depends on your exact requirements.I'm going to start with what's widely considered the "best" approach:In this approach, you've already created a class in your CSS with a different :after or :before style. Place this "new" class later in your stylesheet to make sure it overrides:Then you can easily add or remove this class using jQuery (or vanilla JavaScript):It's possible to use JavaScript to add styles directly to the document stylesheet, including :after and :before styles. jQuery doesn't provide a convenient shortcut, but fortunately the JS isn't that complicated:.addRule() and the related .insertRule() methods are fairly well-supported today. As a variation, you can also use jQuery to add an entirely new stylesheet to the document, but the necessary code isn't any cleaner:If we're talking about "manipulating" the values, not just adding to them, we can also read the existing :after or :before styles using a different approach:We can replace document.querySelector('p') with $('p')[0] when using jQuery, for slightly shorter code.You can also to use attr() in your CSS to read a particular DOM attribute. (If a browser supports :before, it supports attr() as well.) By combining this with content: in some carefully-prepared CSS, we can change the content (but not other properties, like margin or color) of :before and :after dynamically:JS:This can be combined with the second technique if the CSS can't be prepared ahead of time:Although they are rendered by browsers through CSS as if they were like other real DOM elements, pseudo-elements themselves are not part of the DOM, because pseudo-elements, as the name implies, are not real elements, and therefore you can't select and manipulate them directly with jQuery (or any JavaScript APIs for that matter, not even the Selectors API). This applies to any pseudo-elements whose styles you're trying to modify with a script, and not just ::before and ::after.You can only access pseudo-element styles directly at runtime via the CSSOM (think window.getComputedStyle()), which is not exposed by jQuery beyond .css(), a method that doesn't support pseudo-elements either.You can always find other ways around it, though, for example:You can't select pseudo elements in jQuery because they are not part of DOM.

But you can add an specific class to the father element and control its pseudo elements in CSS.EXAMPLEIn jQuery:In CSS:We can also rely on custom properties (aka CSS variables) in order to manipulate pseudo-element. We can read in the specification that:Considering this, the idea is to define the custom property within the element and the pseudo-element will simply inherit it; thus we can easily modify it.1) Using inline style:2) Using CSS and classes3) Using javascript4) Using jQueryIt can also be used with complex values:You may notice that I am considering the syntax var(--c,value) where value is the default value and also called the fallback value.From the same specification we can read:And later:If we don't set the custom property OR we set it to initial OR it contains an invalid value then the fallback value will be used. The use of initial can be helpful in case we want to reset a custom property to its default value.RelatedHow to store inherit value inside a CSS custom property (aka CSS variables)?CSS custom properties (variables) for box modelPlease note that CSS variables might not be available in all browsers you consider relevant (e.g. IE 11): https://caniuse.com/#feat=css-variablesIn the line of what Christian suggests, you could also do:Here is the way to access :after and :before style properties, defined in css:IF you want to to manipulate the ::before or ::after sudo elements entirely through CSS, you could do it JS. See below;Notice how the <style> element has an ID, which you can use to remove it and append to it again if your style changes dynamically.This way, your element is style exactly how you want it through CSS, with the help of JS.one working but not very efficient way is to add a rule to the document with the new content and reference it with a class. depending on what is needed the class might need an unique id for each value in content.Here is the HTML:Computed style on 'before' was content: "VERIFY TO WATCH";Here is my two lines of jQuery, which use the idea of adding an extra class to specifically reference this element and then appending a style tag (with an !important tag) to changes the CSS of the sudo-element's content value:$("span.play:eq(0)").addClass('G');$('body').append("<style>.G:before{content:'NewText' !important}</style>");Thank you all!

I'm always adding my own utils function, which looks like this.or make use of ES6 Features:Why adding classes or attributes when you can just append a style to headThere are many answers here but no answer helps to manipulate the css of :before or :after , not even the accepted one.Here is how I propose to do it. Lets suppose your HTML is like this:And then you are setting its :before in CSS and designing it like:Please notice I also set content attribute in element itself so that you can take it out easily later.

Now there is a button clicking on which, you want to change the color of :before to green and its font-size to 30px. You can achieve that as follows:Define a css with your required style on some class .activeS :Now you can change :before style by adding the class to your :before element as follows:If you just want to get content of :before, it can be done as:Ultimately if you want to dynamically change :before content by jQuery, You can achieve that as follows:Clicking on above "changeBefore" button will change :before content of #something into '22' which is a dynamic value.I hope it helpsI have created a jQuery plugin to add css-pseudo rules like using .css() for specific elements.usage:You can use my plugin for this purpose.JQuery:The values should be specified, as in the normal function of jQuery.cssIn addition, you can also get the value of the pseudo-element parameter, as in the normal function of jQuery.css:JS:GitHub: https://github.com/yuri-spivak/managing-the-properties-of-pseudo-elements/Someone else commented on appending to the head element with a full style element and that's not bad if you're only doing it once but if you need to reset it more than once you'll end up with a ton of style elements. So to prevent that I created a blank style element in the head with an id and replace the innerHTML of it like this:Then the JavaScript would look like this: Now in my case I needed this to set the height of a before element based on the height of another and it will change on resize so using this I can run setHeight() every time the window is resized and it will  replace the <style> properly.Hope that helps someone who was stuck trying to do the same thing.I made use of variables defined in :root inside CSS to modify the :after (the same applies to :before) pseudo-element, in particular to change the background-color value for a styled anchor defined by .sliding-middle-out:hover:after and the content value for another anchor (#reference) in the following demo that generates random colors by using JavaScript/jQuery:HTMLCSSJS/jQueryI have something different stuff for you which is easy and effective.

I have a bunch of elements with a class name red, but I can't seem to select the first element with the class="red" using the following CSS rule:What is wrong in this selector and how do I correct it?Thanks to the comments, I figured out that the element has to be the first child of its parent to get selected which is not the case that I have. I have the following structure, and this rule fails as mentioned in the comments:How can I target the first child with class red?This is one of the most well-known examples of authors misunderstanding how :first-child works. Introduced in CSS2, the :first-child pseudo-class represents the very first child of its parent. That's it. There's a very common misconception that it picks up whichever child element is the first to match the conditions specified by the rest of the compound selector. Due to the way selectors work (see here for an explanation), that is simply not true.Selectors level 3 introduces a :first-of-type pseudo-class, which represents the first element among siblings of its element type. This answer explains, with illustrations, the difference between :first-child and :first-of-type. However, as with :first-child, it does not look at any other conditions or attributes. In HTML, the element type is represented by the tag name. In the question, that type is p.Unfortunately, there is no similar :first-of-class pseudo-class for matching the first child element of a given class. One workaround that Lea Verou and I came up with for this (albeit totally independently) is to first apply your desired styles to all your elements with that class:... then "undo" the styles for elements with the class that come after the first one, using the general sibling combinator ~ in an overriding rule:Now only the first element with class="red" will have a border.Here's an illustration of how the rules are applied:As a bonus, although it was introduced in Selectors 3, the general sibling combinator is actually pretty well-supported by IE7 and newer, unlike :first-of-type and :nth-of-type() which are only supported by IE9 onward. If you need good browser support, you're in luck.In fact, the fact that the sibling combinator is the only important component in this technique, and it has such amazing browser support, makes this technique very versatile — you can adapt it for filtering elements by other things, besides class selectors:Note that in order for this to work, you will need to know in advance what the default styles will be for your other sibling elements so you can override the first rule. Additionally, since this involves overriding rules in CSS, you can't achieve the same thing with a single selector for use with the Selectors API, or Selenium's CSS locators.It's worth mentioning that Selectors 4 introduces an extension to the :nth-child() notation (originally an entirely new pseudo-class called :nth-match()), which will allow you to use something like :nth-child(1 of .red) in lieu of a hypothetical .red:first-of-class. Being a relatively recent proposal, there aren't enough interoperable implementations for it to be usable in production sites yet. Hopefully this will change soon. In the meantime, the workaround I've suggested should work for most cases.Keep in mind that this answer assumes that the question is looking for every first child element that has a given class. There is neither a pseudo-class nor even a generic CSS solution for the nth match of a complex selector across the entire document — whether a solution exists depends heavily on the document structure. jQuery provides :eq(), :first, :last and more for this purpose, but note again that they function very differently from :nth-child() et al. Using the Selectors API, you can either use document.querySelector() to obtain the very first match:Or use document.querySelectorAll() with an indexer to pick any specific match:Although the .red:nth-of-type(1) solution in the original accepted answer by Philip Daubmeier works (which was originally written by Martyn but deleted since), it does not behave the way you'd expect it to.For example, if you only wanted to select the p in your original markup:... then you can't use .red:first-of-type (equivalent to .red:nth-of-type(1)), because each element is the first (and only) one of its type (p and div respectively), so both will be matched by the selector.When the first element of a certain class is also the first of its type, the pseudo-class will work, but this happens only by coincidence. This behavior is demonstrated in Philip's answer. The moment you stick in an element of the same type before this element, the selector will fail. Taking the updated markup:Applying a rule with .red:first-of-type will work, but once you add another p without the class:... the selector will immediately fail, because the first .red element is now the second p element.The :first-child selector is intended, like the name says, to select the first child of a parent tag. The children have to be embedded in the same parent tag. Your exact example will work (Just tried it here):Maybe you have nested your tags in different parent tags? Are your tags of class red really the first tags under the parent?Notice also that this doesnt only apply to the first such tag in the whole document, but everytime a new parent is wrapped around it, like:first and third will be red then.Update:I dont know why martyn deleted his answer, but he had the solution, the :nth-of-type selector:Credits to Martyn. More infos for example here. Be aware that this is a CSS 3 selector, therefore not all browsers will recognize it (e.g. IE8 or older).The correct answer is:Part I: If element is first to its parent and has class "red", it shall get border.

Part II: If ".red" element is not first to its parent, but is immediately following an element without class ".red", it shall also deserve the honor of said border.Fiddle or it didn't happen.Philip Daubmeier's answer, while accepted, is not correct - see attached fiddle.

BoltClock's answer would work, but unnecessarily defines and overwrites styles

(particularly an issue where it otherwise would inherit a different border - you don't want to declare other to border:none)EDIT:

In the event that you have "red" following non-red several times, each "first" red will get the border. To prevent that, one would need to use BoltClock's answer. See fiddleyou could use first-of-type or nth-of-type(1)The above answers are too complex. This will select the first-type of class. MDN SourceTo match your selector, the element must have a class name of red and must be the first child of its parent.Since the other answers cover what's wrong with it, I'll try the other half, how to fix it.  Unfortunately, I don't know that you have a CSS only solution here, at least not that I can think of.  There are some other options though....I got this one in my project.According to your updated problemhow about  This will select class home, then the element span and finally all .red elements that are placed immediately after span elements.  Reference: http://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css_selectors.aspYou could use nth-of-type(1) but be sure that site doesn't need to support IE7 etc, if this is the case use jQuery to add body class then find element via IE7 body class then the element name, then add in the nth-child styling to it.You can change your code to something like this to get it workThis does the job for youHere is a CSS reference from SnoopCode about that.I am using below CSS to have a background image for the list ul liTry this :For some reason none of the above answers seemed to be addressing the case of the real first and only first child of the parent.All the above answers will fail if you want to apply the style to only the first class child within this code.Try This Simple and EffectiveI believe that using relative selector + for selecting elements placed immediately after, works here the best (as few suggested before).It is also possible for this case to use this selectorbut this is element selector not the class one.

Should CSS always preceed Javascript?

[Should CSS always preceed Javascript?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9271276/should-css-always-preceed-javascript)

In countless places online I have seen the recommendation to include CSS prior to JavaScript. The reasoning is generally, of this form:My actual testing reveals something quite different: I use the following Ruby script to generate specific delays for various resources: The above mini server allows me to set arbitrary delays for JavaScript files (both server and client) and arbitrary CSS delays. For example, http://10.0.0.50:8081/test.css?delay=500 gives me a 500 ms delay transferring the CSS. I use the following page to test.When I include the CSS first, the page takes 1.5 seconds to render: When I include the JavaScript first, the page takes 1.4 seconds to render: I get similar results in Chrome, Firefox and Internet Explorer. In Opera however, the ordering simply does not matter.What appears to be happening is that the JavaScript interpreter refuses to start until all the CSS is downloaded. So, it seems that having JavaScript includes first is more efficient as the JavaScript thread gets more run time. Am I missing something, is the recommendation to place CSS includes prior to JavaScript includes not correct? It is clear that we could add async or use setTimeout to free up the render thread or put the JavaScript code in the footer, or use a JavaScript loader. The point here is about ordering of essential JavaScript bits and CSS bits in the head.

It is clear that we could add async or use setTimeout to free up the render thread or put the JavaScript code in the footer, or use a JavaScript loader. The point here is about ordering of essential JavaScript bits and CSS bits in the head.This is a very interesting question.  I've always put my CSS <link href="...">s before my JS <script src="...">s because "I read one time that it's better."  So, you're right; it's high time we do some actual research!I set up my own test harness in Node (code below).  Basically, I:First, with the CSS file delayed by 500ms:Next, I set jQuery to delay by 500ms instead of the CSS:Finally, I set both jQuery and the CSS to delay by 500ms:First, it's important to note that I'm operating under the assumption that you have scripts located in the <head> of your document (as opposed to the end of the <body>).  There are various arguments regarding why you might link to your scripts in the <head> versus the end of the document, but that's outside the scope of this answer.  This is strictly about whether <script>s should go before <link>s in the <head>.In modern DESKTOP browsers, it looks like linking to CSS first never provides a performance gain.  Putting CSS after script gets you a trivial amount of gain when both CSS and script are delayed, but gives you large gains when CSS is delayed.  (Shown by the last columns in the first set of results.)Given that linking to CSS last does not seem to hurt performance but can provide gains under certain circumstances, you should link to external stylesheets after you link to external scripts only on desktop browsers if the performance of old browsers is not a concern.  Read on for the mobile situation.Historically, when a browser encountered a <script> tag pointing to an external resource, the browser would stop parsing the HTML, retrieve the script, execute it, then continue parsing the HTML.  In contrast, if the browser encountered a <link> for an external stylesheet, it would continue parsing the HTML while it fetched the CSS file (in parallel).Hence, the widely-repeated advice to put stylesheets first – they would download first, and the first script to download could be loaded in parallel.However, modern browsers (including all of the browsers I tested with above) have implemented speculative parsing, where the browser "looks ahead" in the HTML and begins downloading resources before scripts download and execute.In old browsers without speculative parsing, putting scripts first will affect performance since they will not download in parallel.Speculative parsing was first implemented in: (along with the percentage of worldwide desktop browser users using this version or greater as of Jan 2012)In total, roughly 85% of desktop browsers in use today support speculative loading.  Putting scripts before CSS will have a performance penalty on 15% of users globally; YMMV based on your site's specific audience.  (And remember that number is shrinking.)On mobile browsers, it's a little harder to get definitive numbers simply due to how heterogeneous the mobile browser and OS landscape is.  Since speculative rendering was implemented in WebKit 525 (released Mar 2008), and just about every worthwhile mobile browser is based on WebKit, we can conclude that "most" mobile browsers should support it.  According to quirksmode, iOS 2.2/Android 1.0 use WebKit 525.  I have no idea what Windows Phone looks like.However, I ran the test on my Android 4 device, and while I saw numbers similar to the desktop results, I hooked it up to the fantastic new remote debugger in Chrome for Android, and Network tab showed that the browser was actually waiting to download the CSS until the JavaScripts completely loaded – in other words, even the newest version of WebKit for Android does not appear to support speculative parsing.  I suspect it might be turned off due to the CPU, memory, and/or network constraints inherent to mobile devices.Forgive the sloppiness – this was Q&D.app.jscss.htmljs.htmltest.jsjquery.js was jquery-1.7.1.min.jsThere are two main reasons to put CSS before JavaScript.It's fun to create examples with Cuzillion. For example, this page has a script in the HEAD so the entire page is blank until it's done downloading. However, if we move the script to the end of the BODY block the page header renders since those DOM elements occur above the SCRIPT tag, as you can see on this page.I would not emphasize too much on the results that you have got, I believe that it is subjective, but I have a reason to explain you that it is better to put in CSS before js.During the loading of your website, there are two scenarios that you would see:CASE 1:    white screen > unstyled website > styled website > interaction > styled and interactive website

CASE 2:    white screen > unstyled website > interaction > styled website > styled and interactive website

I honestly can't imagine anyone choosing Case 2. This would mean that visitors using slow internet connections will be faced with an unstyled website, that allows them to interact with it using Javascript (since that is already loaded). Furthermore, the amount of time spend looking at an unstyled website would be maximized this way. Why would anyone want that?It also works better as jQuery states When the files are loaded in the wrong order (first JS, then CSS), any Javascript code relying on properties set in CSS files (for example the width or height of a div) won't be loaded correctly. It seems that with the wrong loading order, the correct properties are 'sometimes' known to Javascript (perhaps this is caused by a race condition?). This effect seems bigger or smaller depending on the browser used.Were your tests performed on your personal computer, or on a web server? It is a blank page, or is it a complex online system with images, databases, etc.? Are your scripts performing a simple hover event action, or are they a core component to how your website renders and interacts with the user? There are several things to consider here, and the relevance of these recommendations almost always become rules when you venture into high-caliber web development.The purpose of the "put stylesheets at the top and scripts at the bottom" rule is that, in general, it's the best way to achieve optimal progressive rendering, which is critical to the user experience.All else aside: assuming your test is valid, and you really are producing results contrary to the popular rules, it'd come as no surprise, really. Every website (and everything it takes to make the whole thing appear on a user's screen) is different and the Internet is constantly evolving. I include CSS files before Javascript for a different reason.If my Javascript needs to do dynamic sizing of some page element (for those corner cases where CSS is really a main in the back) then loading the CSS after the JS is russing can lead to race conditions, where the element is resized before CSS styles are applied and thus looks weird when the styles finally kick in. If I load the CSS beforehand I can guarantee that things run in the intended order and that the final layout is what I want it to be.Is the recommendation to include CSS before JavaScript invalid?Not if you treat it as simply a recommendation. But if your treat it as a hard and fast rule?, yes, it is invalid.From https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Reference/Events/DOMContentLoadedIt appears that you need to know what each script relies on and make sure that execution of the script is delayed until after the right completion event. If the script relies only on the DOM, it can resume in ondomready/domcontentloaded, if it relies on images to be loaded or stylesheets to be applied, then if I read the above reference correctly, that code must be deferred until the onload event.I don't think that one sock size fits all, even though that is the way they are sold and I know that one shoe size does not fit all. I don't think that there is a definitive answer to which to load first, styles or script. It is more a case by case decision of what must be loaded in what order and what can be deferred until later as not being on the "critical path".To speak to the observer that commented that it is better to delay the users ability to interact until the sheet is pretty. There are many of you out there and you annoy your counterparts that feel the opposite. They came to a site to accomplish a purpose and delays to their ability to interact with a site while waiting for things that don't matter to finish loading are very frustrating.  I am not saying that you are wrong, only that you should be aware that there is another faction that exists that does not share your priority.This question particularly applies to all of the ads being placed on web sites. I would love it if site authors rendered just placeholder divs for the ad content and made sure that their site was loaded and interactive before injecting the ads in an onload event.  Even then I would like to see the ads loaded serially instead of all at once because they impact my ability to even scroll the site content while the bloated ads are loading. But that is just one persons point of view.Updated 2017-12-16I was not sure about the tests in OP. I decided to experiment a little and ended up busting some of the myths.This is no longer true. Have a look at the waterfall generated by Chrome 63:This is incorrect. The stylesheet will not block download but it will block execution of the script (little explanation here). Have a look at performance chart generated by Chrome 63:Keeping the above in mind, the results in OP can be explained as follows:CSS First:JS First:I'm not exactly sure how your testing 'render' time as your using java script. However consider thisOne page on your site is 50k which is not unreasonable. The user is on the east coast while your server is on the west. MTU is definitely not 10k so there will be a few trips back and forth. It may take 1/2 a second to receive your page and stylesheets. Typically (for me) javascript (via jquery plugin and such) are much more than CSS. Theres also what happens when your internet connection chokes up midway on the page but lets ignore that (it happens to me occasionally and i believe the css renders but i am not 100% sure).Since css is in head there may be additional connections to get it which means it potentially can finish before the page does. Anyways during the type the remainder of the page takes and the javascript files (which is many more bytes) the page is unstyled which makes the site/connection appear slow.EVEN IF the JS interpreter refuses to start until the CSS is done the time taken to download the javascript code especially when far from the server is cutting into css time which will make the site look not pretty.Its a small optimization but thats the reason for it.Here is a SUMMARY of all the major answers above (or maybe below later :)For modern browsers, put css wherever you like it. They would analyze your html file (which they call speculative parsing) and start downloading css in parallel with html parsing. For old browsers keep putting css on top (if you don't want to show a naked but interactive page first).For all browsers, put javascript as farther down on the page as possible, since it will halt parsing of your html. Preferably, download it asynchronously (i.e., ajax call)There are also, some experimental results for a particular case which claims putting javascript first (as opposed to traditional wisdom of putting CSS first) gives better performance but there is no logical reasoning given for it, and lacks validation regarding widespread applicability, so you can ignore it for now. So, to answer the question: Yes. The recommendation to include the CSS before JS is invalid for the modern browsers. Put CSS wherever you like, and put JS towards the end, as possible. Steve Souders has already given a definitive answer but...I wonder whether there's an issue with both Sam's original test and Josh's repeat of it.Both tests appear to have been performed on low latency connections where setting up the TCP connection will have a trivial cost.How this affects the result of the test I'm not sure and I'd want to look at the waterfalls for the tests over a 'normal' latency connection but...The first file downloaded should get the connection used for the html page, and the second file downloaded will get the new connection. (Flushing the  early alters that dynamic, but it's not being done here)In newer browsers the second TCP connection is opened speculatively so the connection overhead is reduced / goes away, in older browsers this isn't true and the second connection will have the overhead of being opened.Quite how/if this affects the outcome of the tests I'm not sure.I think this wont be true for all the cases. Because css will download parallel but js cant. Consider for the same case,Instead of having single css, take 2 or 3 css files and try it out these ways,1) css..css..js

2) css..js..css

3) js..css..cssI'm sure css..css..js will give better result than all others. We have to keep in mind that new browsers have worked on their Javascript engines, their parsers and so on, optimizing common code and markup problems in a way that problems experienced in ancient browsers such as <=IE8 are no longer relevant, not only with regards to markup but also to use of JavaScript variables, element selectors etc. 

I can see in the not so distant future a situation where technology has reached a point where performance is not really an issue anymore.Personally, I would not place too much emphasis on such "folk wisdom."  What may have been true in the past might well not be true now.  I would assume that all of the operations relating to a web-page's interpretation and rendering are fully asynchronous ("fetching" something and "acting upon it" are two entirely different things that might be being handled by different threads, etc.), and in any case entirely beyond your control or your concern.I'd put CSS references in the "head" portion of the document, along with any references to external scripts.  (Some scripts may demand to be placed in the body, and if so, oblige them.)Beyond that ... if you observe that "this seems to be faster/slower than that, on this/that browser," treat this observation as an interesting but irrelevant curiosity and don't let it influence your design decisions.  Too many things change too fast.  (Anyone want to lay any bets on how many minutes it will be before the Firefox team comes out with yet another interim-release of their product?  Yup, me neither.)

I'm using Twitter Bootstrap 3, and I have problems when I want to align vertically two div, for example — JSFiddle link:The grid system in Bootstrap uses float: left, not display:inline-block, so the property vertical-align doesn't work. I tried using margin-top to fix it, but I think this is not a good solution for the responsive design.

I'm using Twitter Bootstrap 3, and I have problems when I want to align vertically two div, for example — JSFiddle link:The grid system in Bootstrap uses float: left, not display:inline-block, so the property vertical-align doesn't work. I tried using margin-top to fix it, but I think this is not a good solution for the responsive design.You still can use a custom class when you need it:BootplyUsing inline-block adds extra space between blocks if you let a real space in your code (like ...</div> </div>...). This extra space breaks our grid if column sizes add up to 12:Here, we've got extra spaces between <div class="[...] col-lg-2"> and <div class="[...] col-lg-10"> (a carriage return and 2 tabs/8 spaces). And so...Let's kick this extra space!!Notice the seemingly useless comments <!-- ... -->? They are important -- without them, the whitespace between the <div> elements will take up space in the layout, breaking the grid system.Note: the Bootply has been updatedWith the advent of the CSS Flexible Box, many of web designers' nightmares1 have been resolved. One of the most hacky ones, the vertical alignment. Now it is possible even in unknown heights.Flexible Box (or in short, Flexbox), is a new layout system that is specifically designed for layout purposes. The specification states:How can it help in this case? Well, let's see.Using Twitter Bootstrap we have .rows having some .col-*s. All we need to do is to display the desired .row2 as a flex container box and then align all its flex items (the columns) vertically by align-items property.EXAMPLE HERE (Please read the comments with care)Colored area displays the padding-box of columns.Important note #1: Twitter Bootstrap doesn't specify the width of columns in extra small devices unless you give one of .col-xs-# classes to the columns.Therefore in this particular demo, I have used .col-xs-* classes in order for columns to be displayed properly in mobile mode, because it specifies the width of the column explicitly.But alternatively you could switch off the Flexbox layout simply by changing display: flex; to display: block; in specific screen sizes. For instance:Or you could specify .vertical-align only on specific screen sizes like so:In that case, I'd go with @KevinNelson's approach.Important note #2: Vendor prefixes omitted due to brevity. Flexbox syntax has been changed during the time. The new written syntax won't work on older versions of web browsers (but not that old as Internet Explorer 9! Flexbox is supported on Internet Explorer 10 and later).This means you should also use vendor-prefixed properties like display: -webkit-box and so on in production mode.If you click on "Toggle Compiled View" in the Demo, you'll see the prefixed version of CSS declarations (thanks to Autoprefixer).As you see in the previous demo, columns (the flex items) are no longer as high as their container (the flex container box. i.e. the .row element).This is because of using center value for align-items property. The default value is stretch so that the items can fill the entire height of the parent element.In order to fix that, you can add display: flex; to the columns as well:EXAMPLE HERE (Again, mind the comments)Colored area displays the padding-box of columns.Last, but not least, notice that the demos and code snippets here are meant to give you a different idea, to provide a modern approach to achieve the goal. Please mind the "Big Alert" section if you are going to use this approach in real world websites or applications.For further reading including browser support, these resources would be useful:1. Vertically align an image inside a div with responsive height

2. It's better to use an additional class in order not to alter Twitter Bootstrap's  default .row.The below code worked for me:Update 2020I know the original question was for Bootstrap 3, but now that Bootstrap 4 has been released, here is some updated guidance on vertical center.Important! Vertical center is relative to the height of the parentNow that Bootstrap 4 is flexbox by default there are many different approaches to vertical alignment using: auto-margins, flexbox utils, or the display utils along with vertical align utils. At first "vertical align utils" seems obvious, but these only work with inline and table display elements. Here are some Bootstrap 4 vertical centering options..1 - Vertical Center Using Auto Margins:Another way to vertically center is to use my-auto. This will center the element within its container. For example, h-100 makes the row full height, and my-auto will vertically center the col-sm-12 column.Bootstrap 4 - Vertical center using auto-margins Demomy-auto represents margins on the vertical y-axis and is equivalent to:2 - Vertical Center with Flexbox:Since Bootstrap 4 .row is now display:flex you can simply use align-self-center on any column to vertically center it...or, use align-items-center on the entire .row to vertically center align all col-* in the row...Bootstrap 4 - Vertical center different height columns Demo3 - Vertical Center Using Display Utils:Bootstrap 4 has display utils that can be used for display:table, display:table-cell, display:inline, etc.. These can be used with the vertical alignment utils to align inline, inline-block or table cell elements.Bootstrap 4 - Vertical center using display utils DemoAlso see:

Vertical Align Center in Bootstrap 4Flexbox method on the container of the item(s) to center:Transform translateY method:Display inline method:Demo of Bootstrap 3 centering methodsTry this in the CSS of the div:I thought I'd share my "solution" in case it helps anyone else who isn't familiar with the @media queries themselves.Thanks to @HashemQolami's answer, I built some media queries that would work mobile-up like the col-* classes so that I could stack the col-* for mobile but display them vertically-aligned in the center for larger screens, e.g..More complicated layouts that require a different number of columns per screen resolution (e.g. 2 rows for -xs, 3 for -sm, and 4 for -md, etc.) would need some more advanced finagling, but for a simple page with -xs stacked and -sm and larger in rows, this works fine.Following the accepted answer, if you do not wish to customize the markup, for separation of concerns or simply because you use a CMS, the following solution works fine:The limitation here is that you cannot inherit font size from the parent element because the row sets the font size to 0 in order to remove white space.I prefer this method as per David Walsh Vertical center CSS:The transform isn't essential; it just finds the center a little more accurately. Internet Explorer 8 may be slightly less centered as a result, but it is still not bad - Can I use - Transforms 2d.This is my solution. Just add this class to your CSS content.Then your HTML would look like this:I just did this and it does what I want it to do.And now my page looks likeI genuinely find the following code works using Chrome and not other browsers than the currently selected answer:You may need to amend the heights (specifically on .v-center) and remove/change div on div[class*='col-'] for your needs.I ran into this same issue. In my case I did not know the height of the outer container, but this is how I fixed it:First set the height for your html and body elements so that they are 100%. This is important! Without this, the html and body elements will simply inherit the height of their children.Then I had an outer container class with:And lastly the inner container with class:HTML is as simple as:This is all you need to vertically align contents. Check it out in fiddle:If you are using the Less version of Bootstrap, and compiling into CSS yourself, you can use some utility classes to use with Bootstrap classes.I've found these to work fantastically well where I want to preserve the responsiveness and configurability of the Bootstrap grid system (like using -md or -sm), but I want all columns in a given row to all have the same vertical height (so that I can then vertically align their content and have all columns in the row share a common middle).There isn't any need for table and table-cells. It can be achieved easily using transform.Example: http://codepen.io/arvind/pen/QNbwyMCode:I elaborated a bit on zessx's answer, in order to make it easier to use when mixing different column sizes on different screen sizes.If you use Sass, you can add this to your scss-file:Which generates the following CSS (that you can use directly in your stylesheets, if you are not using Sass):Now you can use it on your responsive columns like this:Flex behaviors are natively supported since Bootstrap 4. Add d-flex align-items-center in the row div. You no longer need to modify your CSS content.Simple example: http://jsfiddle.net/vgks6L74/With your example:

http://jsfiddle.net/7zwtL702/Source: Flex · BootstrapOK, accidentally I've mixed a few solutions, and it finally works now for my layout where I tried to make a 3x3 table with Bootstrap columns on the smallest resolution.Try this,There are several ways you can do it:With Bootstrap 4 (which is in alpha currently) you can use the .align-items-center class. So you can keep the responsive character of Bootstrap.

Workes straight away fine for me. See Bootstrap 4 Documentation.HTMLCSSI ran into the same situation where I wanted to align a few div elements vertically in a row and found that Bootstrap classes col-xx-xx applies style to the div as float: left.I had to apply the style on the div elements like style="Float:none" and all my div elements started vertically aligned. Here is the working example:Just in case someone wants to read more about the float property:

Also, IE7 apparently shouldn't suffer from this problem due to its incorrect behaviour, but in my situation it's suffering the same as Firefox.Which method currently available to us is the most robust?Depending upon the design being produced, each of the below clearfix CSS solutions has its own benefits.The clearfix does have useful applications but it has also been used as a hack. Before you use a clearfix perhaps these modern css solutions can be useful:The simplest way to clear floated elements is using the style overflow: auto on the containing element. This solution works in every modern browsers.One downside, using certain combinations of margin and padding on the external element can cause scrollbars to appear but this can be solved by placing the margin and padding on another parent containing element.Using ‘overflow: hidden’ is also a clearfix solution, but will not have scrollbars, however using hidden will crop any content positioned outside of the containing element.Note: The floated element is an img tag in this example, but could be any html element.Thierry Koblentz on CSSMojo wrote: The very latest clearfix reloaded. He noted that by dropping support for oldIE, the solution can be simplified to one css statement. Additionally, using display: block (instead of display: table) allows margins to collapse properly when elements with clearfix are siblings.This is the most modern version of the clearfix.⋮⋮The below solutions are not necessary for modern browsers, but may be useful for targeting older browsers.Note that these solutions rely upon browser bugs and therefore should be used only if none of the above solutions work for you.They are listed roughly in chronological order.Thierry Koblentz' of CSS Mojo has pointed out that when targeting modern browsers, we can now drop the zoom and ::before property/values and simply use:This solution does not support for IE 6/7 …on purpose!Thierry also offers: "A word of caution: if you start a new project from scratch, go for it, but don’t swap this technique with the one you have now, because even though you do not support oldIE, your existing rules prevent collapsing margins."The most recent and globally adopted clearfix solution, the Micro Clearfix by Nicolas Gallagher.Known support: Firefox 3.5+, Safari 4+, Chrome, Opera 9+, IE 6+This basic method is preferred for the usual case, when positioned content will not show outside the bounds of the container.http://www.quirksmode.org/css/clearing.html

- explains how to resolve common issues related to this technique, namely, setting width: 100% on the container.Rather than using the display property to set "hasLayout" for IE, other properties can be used for triggering "hasLayout" for an element.Another way to clear floats using the overflow property is to use the underscore hack. IE will apply the values prefixed with the underscore, other browsers will not. The zoom property triggers hasLayout in IE:While this works... it is not ideal to use hacks.This older "Easy Clearing" method has the advantage of allowing positioned elements to hang outside the bounds of the container, at the expense of more tricky CSS.This solution is quite old, but you can learn all about Easy Clearing on Position Is Everything: http://www.positioniseverything.net/easyclearing.htmlThe quick and dirty solution (with some drawbacks) for when you’re quickly slapping something together:There are two important considerations when floating stuff:There's only one way to do both of these. And that is to establish a new block formatting context. Elements that establish a block formatting context are an insulated rectangle in which floats interact with each other. A block formatting context will always be tall enough to visually wrap its floating descendants, and no floats outside of a block formatting context may interact with elements inside. This two-way insulation is exactly what you want. In IE, this same concept is called hasLayout, which can be set via zoom: 1.There are several ways to establish a block formatting context, but the solution I recommend is display: inline-block with width: 100%. (Of course, there are the usual caveats with using width: 100%, so use box-sizing: border-box or put padding, margin, and border on a different element.)Probably the most common application of floats is the two-column layout. (Can be extended to three columns.)First the markup structure.And now the CSS.Go to JS Bin to play around with the code and see how this solution is built from the ground up.The problem with the traditional clearfix solutions is that they use two different rendering concepts to achieve the same goal for IE and everyone else. In IE they use hasLayout to establish a new block formatting context, but for everyone else they use generated boxes (:after) with clear: both, which does not establish a new block formatting context. This means things won't behave the same in all situations. For an explanation of why this is bad, see Everything you Know about Clearfix is Wrong.The new standard, as used by Inuit.css and Bourbon - two very widely used and well-maintained CSS/Sass frameworks:Keep in mind that clearfixes are essentially a hack for what flexbox layouts can now provide in a much smarter way. CSS floats were originally designed for inline content to flow around - like images in a long textual article - and not for grid layouts and the like. If your target browsers support flexbox, it's worth looking into.This doesn't support IE7. You shouldn't be supporting IE7. Doing so continues to expose users to unfixed security exploits and makes life harder for all other web developers, as it reduces the pressure on users and organisations to switch to modern browsers.This clearfix was announced and explained by Thierry Koblentz in July 2012. It sheds unnecessary weight from Nicolas Gallagher's 2011 micro-clearfix. In the process, it frees a pseudo-element for your own use. This has been updated to use display: block rather than display: table (again, credit to Thierry Koblentz).I recommend using the following, which is taken from http://html5boilerplate.com/The overflow property can be used to clear floats with no additional mark-up:This works for all browsers except IE6, where all you need to do is enable hasLayout (zoom being my preferred method):http://www.quirksmode.org/css/clearing.htmlI've found a bug in the official CLEARFIX-Method:

The DOT doesn't have a font-size.

And if you set the height = 0 and the first Element in your DOM-Tree has the class "clearfix" you'll allways have a margin at the bottom of the page of 12px :)You have to fix it like this:It's now part of the YAML-Layout ... Just take a look at it - it's very interesting!

http://www.yaml.de/en/home.htmlThis is quite a tidy solution: From http://nicolasgallagher.com/micro-clearfix-hack/Clearfix from bootstrap:I just use :-Works best and compatible with IE8+ :)Given the huge amount of replies I was not gonna post. However, this method may help someone, as it did help me.It's worth to mention, I avoid floats like Ebola. There's many reasons and I am not alone; Read Rikudo answer about what is a clearfix and you'll see what I mean. In his own words: ...the use of floated elements for layout is getting more and more discouraged with the use of better alternatives... There are other good (and sometimes better) options out there other than floats. As technology advances and improves, flexbox (and other methods) are going to be widely adopted and floats will become just a bad memory. Maybe a CSS4?First off, sometimes, you may think that you are safe from floats until your lifesaver is punctured and your html flow starts to sink:In the codepen http://codepen.io/omarjuvera/pen/jEXBya below, the practice of clearing a float with <div classs="clear"></div> (or other element) is common but frown upon and anti-semantic.CSSHowever, just when you thought your float is sail worthy...boom! As the screen size becomes smaller and smaller you see weird behaviors in like the graphic below (Same http://codepen.io/omarjuvera/pen/jEXBya):Why should you care?

I am not sure of the exact figure but about 80% (or more) of the devices used are mobile devices with small screens. Desktop computers/laptops are no longer king.This is not the only problem with floats. There are many, but in this example, some may say all you have to do is to place your floats in a container. But as you can see in the codepen and graphic, that is not the case. It apparently made things worst:HTMLCSSAs for the result?It's the *** same!

Least you know, you'll start a CSS party, inviting all kinds of selectors and properties to the party; making a bigger mess of your CSS than what you started with. Just to fix your float.This simple and very adaptable piece of CSS is a beauty and a "savior":That's it! It really works without breaking semantics and did I mention it works?:From the same sample...HTMLCSSNow we no longer need <div classs="clear"></div> <!-- Acts as a wall --> and keep the semantic police happy. This is not the only benefit. This clearfix is responsive to any screen size without the use of @media in it's simplest form. In other words, it will keep your float container in check and preventing floodings. Lastly, it provides support for old browsers all in one small karate chop =) I always float the main sections of my grid and apply clear: both; to the footer. That doesn't require an extra div or class.honestly; all solutions seem to be a hack to fix a rendering bug ... am i wrong?i've found <br clear="all" /> to be the easiest, simplest. seeing class="clearfix" everywhere can't stroke the sensibilities of someone who objects to extraneous markeup elements, can it? you're just painting the problem on a different canvas.i also use the display: hidden solution, which is great and requires no extra class declarations or html markup ... but sometimes you need the elements to overflow the container, for eg. pretty ribbons and sashesI have tried all these solutions, a big margin will be added to <html> element automatically when I use the code below:Finally, I solved the margin problem by adding font-size: 0; to the above CSS.With SASS, the clearfix is:and it's used like:if you want the new clearfix:With LESS (http://lesscss.org/), one can create a handy clearfix helper:And then use it with problematic containers, for example:Using overflow:hidden/auto and height for ie6 will suffice if the floating container has a parent element. Either one of the #test could work, for the HTML stated below to clear floats.In cases when this refuses to work with ie6, just float the parent to clear float. Never really needed any other kind of clearing yet. Maybe it's the way I write my HTML.I'd float #content too, that way both columns contain floats. Also because it will allow you to clear elements inside #content without clearing the side bar.Same thing with the wrapper, you'd need to make it a block formatting context to wrap the two columns.This article mentions a few triggers you can use:

block formatting contexts.A clearfix is a way for an element to automatically clear after itself, 

so that you don't need to add additional markup.Normally you would need to do something as follows:With clearfix, you only need toA new display value seems to the job in one line.From the w3 spec: "The element generates a block container box, and lays out its contents using flow layout. It always establishes a new block formatting context for its contents."Information:

https://github.com/fliptheweb/postcss-flow-rootWhy just trying to use css hack to do what 1 line of HTML do the job. And why not to use semantic html tu put break to return to the line?Fo me is realy better to use : And if you don't want any style in your html you just have to use class for your break

and put .clear { clear:both; } in your CSS.Advantage of this:Assuming you're using this HTML structure:Here's the CSS that I would use:I use this set all the time and it works fine for me, even in IE6.Other clearfixes either require the floated element to be in a well marked off container or need an extra, semantically empty <div>. Conversely, clear separation of content and markup requires a strict CSS solution to this problem.The mere fact that one needs to mark off the end of a float, does not allow for unattended CSS typesetting.If the latter is your goal, the float should be left open for anything (paragraphs, ordered and unordered lists etc.) to wrap around it, until a "clearfix" is encountered. For example, the clearfix might be set by a new heading.This is why I use the following clearfix with new headings:This solution gets used extensively on my website to solve the problem: The text next to a floated miniature is short and the top-margin of the next clearing object is not respected.It also prevents any manual intervention when automatically generating PDFs from the site.

Here is an example page.I always use the micro-clearfix :In Cascade Framework I even apply it by default on block level elements. IMO, applying it by default on block level elements gives block level elements more intuitive behavior than their traditonal behavior. It also made it a lot easier for me to add support for older browsers to Cascade Framework (which supports IE6-8 as well as modern browsers).You could also put this in your CSS:And add class "cb" to your parent div:You will not need to add anything else to your original code...Have you tried this:I haven't had any problems with this method.My Favourite Method is to create a clearfix class in my css / scss document as below And then call it in my html document as shown below It is so simple clearfix clears the issue by when we using the float properties inside the div element.If we use two div elements one as float:left; and other one as float:right; we can use clearfix for the parent of the two div element. If we refuse to use clearfix unnecessary spaces fill with contents below and site structure will be broken.

In what situations is it more appropriate to use an HTML IMG tag to display an image, as opposed to a CSS background-image, and vice-versa?Factors may include accessibility, browser support, dynamic content, or any kind of technical limits or usability principles.It's a black and white decision to me. If the image is part of the content such as a logo or diagram or person (real person, not stock photo people) then use the <img /> tag plus alt attribute. For everything else there's CSS background images.The other time to use CSS background images is when doing image-replacement of text eg. paragraphs/headers.I'm surprised no one's mentioned this yet: CSS transitions.You can natively transition a div's background image:This saves any kind of JavaScript or jQuery animation to fade an <img/>'s src.More information about transitions on MDN.Above answers considers only Design aspect . I am listing it in SEO aspects.When to use <img /> When to use CSS background-imageAs i will use them based on these reasons. These are Good practices of Search Engine Optimization of Images.Browsers aren't always set to print background images by default; if you intend to have people print your page :)If you have your CSS in an external file, then it's often convenient to display an image that's used frequently across the site (such as a header image) as a background image, because then you have the flexibility to change the image later.For example, say you have the following HTML:...and CSS:A few days later, you change the location of the image. All you have to do is update the CSS:Otherwise, you'd have to update the src attribute of the appropriate <img> tag in every HTML file (assuming you're not using a server-side scripting language or CMS to automate the process).Also background images are useful if you don't want the user to be able to save the image (although I haven't ever needed to do this).About the same as sanchothefat's answer, but from a different aspect. I always ask myself: if I would completely remove the stylesheets from the website, do the remaining elements only belong to the content? If so, I did my job well.Some answers overcomplicate the scenario here. This is a dead simple situation.Just answer to this question every time you'd like to place an image:Is this part of the content or part of the design?If you can't answer this, you probably don't know what you're doing or what you want to do!Also, DO NOT consider beside the two technique, just because you'd wish to be "printer friendly" or not. Also DO NOT hide content from a SEO point of view with CSS. If you find yourself managing your content in CSS files, you shot yourself in the leg. This is just a trivial decision of what is content or not. Every other aspect should be ignored.I would add another two arguments:One more benefit from using the <IMG> tag is related to SEO - i.e. you can provide additional information about the image in the ALT attribute of the image tag, while there's no way to provide such information when specifying the image through CSS and in that case only the image file name may be indexed by search engines. The ALT attribute definitely gives the <IMG> tag SEO advantage over the CSS approach. That's why according to me it is better to specify the images you want to rank well in the image search results (e.g. Google Image Search) using the <IMG> tag.Foreground = img.Background = CSS background.Use background images only when necessary e.g. containers with image that tiles.One of the major PROS by using IMAGES is that it is better for SEO.Using a background image, you need to absolutely specify the dimensions. This can be a significant problem if you don't actually know them in advance or cannot determine them. A big problem with <img /> is overlays. What if I want an CSS inner shadow on my image (box-shadow:inset 0 0 5px rgb(0,0,0,.5))? In this case, since <img /> can't have child elements, you need to use positioning and add empty elements which equates to useless markup.In conclusion, it's quite situational.A couple of other scenarios where background-image should be used:Use CSS background-image in a case of multiple skins or versions of design. Javascript can be used to dynamically change a class of an element, which will force it to render a different image. With an IMG tag, it may be more tricky.Here's a technical consideration: will the image be generated dynamically? It tends to be a lot easier to generate the <img> tag in HTML than to try to dynamically edit a CSS property.What about the size of the image? If I use the img tag, the browser scales the image. If I use css background, the browser just cuts a chunk from the larger image.In regards to animating images using CSS TranslateX/Y (The proper way to animate html) - If you do a Chrome Timeline recording of CSS background-images being animated vs IMG tags being animated you will see the paint times are drastically shorter for the CSS background-images. There's another reason! If you have a responsive design and want to split usage of low, medium, and high-res images for devices through media queries, you should use backgrounds as well.Also, i have a gallery section which has inconsistent picture sizes so even though those images are obviously considered content, I use background images and center them in divs with a set size. This is similar to what facebook does in their albums..img is an html tag for a reason, therefore it should be used. For referencing or to illustrate things, people e.g: in articles.Also if the image has a meaning or has to be clickable an img is better than a css background. For all other situation, I think, a css background can be used. Although, it is a subject that needs to be discussed over and over.Web Student from Paris, FranceJust a small one to add, you should use the img tag if you want users to be able to 'right click' and 'save-image'/'save-picture', so if you intend to provide the image as a resource for others.Using background image will (as far as I'm aware on most browsers) disable the option to save the image directly.A small input, 

I have had problems with responsive images slowing down the rendering on iphone for up to a minute, even with small images:But when switching to using background images the problem went away, this is only viable if targeting newer browsers.IMG load first because the src is in the html file itself whereas in the case of background-image the source is mentioned in stylesheet so the image loads after the stylesheet loaded, delaying the loading of the webpage.HTML is for content and CSS is for design. Is the image necessary and does it need to be picked up by screen readers? If the answer is yes, then put the image in the HTML. If it is purely for styling, then you can use the background-image property in CSS to inject the image. Just as a lot of people here have already mentioned, you can then use a pseudo element on the image if you like.Also note that most search engine spiders don't index CSS background images therefore the background images will be ignored and you won't be able to get any traffic from search engines (no SEO benefit in short).Where as all images defined with  tags are indexed (unless manually excluded) and can bring in traffic from search engines if their title/alt attributes and filenames are optimized properly (w.r.t some keyword).You can use IMG tags if you want the images to be fluid and scale to different screen sizes. For me these images are mostly part of the content. For most elements that are not part of the content, I use CSS sprites to keep the download size minimal unless I really want to animate icons etc.I use image instead of background-image when i want to make them 100% stretchable which supported in most browsers.If you want to add an image only for the special content on the page or for only one page the you should use IMG tag and if you want to put image on more than one pages then you should use  CSS Background Image.Another background-image PRO: Background-images for <ul>/<ol> lists.Use background images if they are part of the overall-design and are repeated on multiple pages. Preferably in background sprite form for optimization.Use  tags for all images that are not part of the overall design, and are most likely placed once, like specific images for articles, people, and important images that deserve to be added to google images.** The only repeated image that I enclose in a <img> tag is the site/company logo. Because people tend to click it to go to the homepage, thus you wrap it with an <a> tag.

Is it possible to include one CSS file in another?

2008-09-29 04:23:10Z

Is it possible to include one CSS file in another?Yes:Note:Yes. Importing CSS file into another CSS file is possible. It must be the first rule in the style sheet using the @import rule.The only caveat is that older web browsers will not support it. In fact, this is one of the CSS 'hack' to hide CSS styles from older browsers.Refer to this list for browser support. The @import url("base.css"); works fine but bear in mind that every @import statement is a new request to the server. This might not be a problem for you, but when optimal performance is required you should avoid the @import. The CSS @import rule does just that. E.g.,Yes.The rule is documented here.In some cases it is possible using @import "file.css", and most modern browsers should support this, older browsers such as NN4, will go slightly nuts. Note: the import statement must precede all other declarations in the file, and test it on all your target browsers before using it in production.Yes, use @import detailed info easily googled for, a good one at http://webdesign.about.com/od/beginningcss/f/css_import_link.htmyes it is possible using @import and providing the path of css file

e.g.or  @import("/path-to-your-styles.css"); That is the best way to include a css stylesheet within a css stylesheet using css.The "@import" rule could calls in multiple styles files. These files are called by the browser or User Agent when needed e.g. HTML tags call the CSS.CSS File "main.css" Contains The Following Syntax:To insert in style element use createTexNode don't use innerHTML but:As opposed to the best answer, it is not recommended to aggregate all CSS files into one chunk when using HTTP/2.0I use this to import bootstrap.css in altervista with wordpressand it works fine, as it would delete the html link rel code if I put it into a pageYes You can import easily one css to another (any where in website)

You have to use like:For whatever reason, @import didn't work for me, but it's not really necessary is it?Here's what I did instead, within the html:Notice that media="print" has 2 stylesheets: myap-print.css and myap-screen.css. It's the same effect as including myap-screen.css within myap-print.css.sing the CSS @import Rule

hereI have created main.css file and included all css files in it.We can include only one main.css fileI stumbled upon this and I just wanted to say PLEASE DON'T USE @IMPORT IN CSS!!!! The import statement is sent to the client and the client does another request. If you want to divide your CSS between various files use Less. In Less the import statement happens on the server and the output is cached and does not create a performance penalty by forcing the client to make another connection. Sass is also an option another not one I have explored. Frankly, if you are not using Less or Sass then you should start. http://willseitz-code.blogspot.com/2013/01/using-less-to-manage-css-files.html

Can CSS be used to hide the scroll bar? How would you do this?Set overflow: hidden; on the body tag like this:The code above hides both the horizontal and vertical scrollbar.If you want to hide only the vertical scrollbar, use overflow-y:And if you want to hide only the horizontal scrollbar, use overflow-x:Note: It'll also disable the scrolling feature. Refer to the below answers if you just want to hide the scroll bar, but not the scroll feature.WebKit supports scrollbar pseudo elements that can be hidden with standard CSS rules:If you want all scrollbars hidden, useI'm not sure about restoring - this did work, but there might be a right way to do it:You can of course always use width: 0, which can then be easily restored with width: auto, but I'm not a fan of abusing width for visibility tweaks.Firefox 64 now supports the experimental scrollbar-width property by default (63 requires a configuration flag to be set). To hide the scrollbar in Firefox 64:To see if your current browser supports either the pseudo element or scrollbar-width, try this snippet:(Note that this is not really a correct answer to the question, because it hides the horizontal bars as well, but that's what I was looking for when Google pointed me here, so I figured I'd post it anyway.)When you ask the question, "Can the scroll-bars of a browser be removed in some way, rather than simply hidden or camouflaged", everyone will say "Not possible" because it is not possible to remove the scrollbars from all browsers in a compliant and cross-compatible way, and then there's the whole argument of usability.However, it is possible to prevent the browser from ever having the need to generate and display scrollbars if you do not allow your webpage to overflow.This just means that we have to proactively substitute the same behavior that the browser would typically do for us and tell the browser thanks but no thanks buddy.  Rather than try to remove scrollbars (which we all know is not possible) we can avoid scrolling (perfectly feasible) and scroll within the elements that we make and have more control over.Create a div with overflow hidden. Detect when the user attempts to scroll, but is unable to because we've disabled the browsers ability to scroll with overflow: hidden.. and instead move the content up using JavaScript when this occurs. Thereby creating our own scrolling without the browsers default scrolling or use a plugin like iScroll.For the sake of being thorough; all the vendor specific ways of manipulating scroll-bars:*These properties were never part of the CSS specification, nor were they ever approved or vendor prefixed, but they work in Internet Explorer and Konqueror. These can also be set locally in the user style sheet for each application. In Internet Explorer you find it under the "Accessibility" tab, in Konqueror under the "Stylesheets" tab.As of Internet Explorer 8 these properties were vendor prefixed by Microsoft, but they were still never approved by W3C.Internet Explorer makes scroll available which sets whether or not to disable or enable scroll bars; it can also be used to get the value of the position of the scroll bars.With Microsoft Internet Explorer 6 and later, when you use the !DOCTYPE declaration to specify standards-compliant mode, this attribute applies to the HTML element. When standards-compliant mode is not specified, as with earlier versions of Internet Explorer, this attribute applies to the BODY element, NOT the HTML element.It's also worth noting that when working with .NET the ScrollBar class in System.Windows.Controls.Primitives in the Presentation framework is responsible for rendering the scrollbars.http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ie/ms534393(v=vs.85).aspxWebKit extensions related to scroll-bar customization are:These can each be combined with additional pseudo-selectors:Examples of these combinationsMozilla does have some extensions for manipulating the scroll-bars, but they are all recommended not to be used.This is not really useful as far as I know, but it's worth noting that the attribute which controls whether or not scrollbars are displayed in Firefox is (reference link):As has been previously mentioned in some other answers, here is an illustration which is sufficiently self-explanatory.Just because I'm curious, I wanted to learn about the origin of scrollbars, and these are the best references I found.In an HTML5 specification draft, the seamless attribute was defined to prevent scroll-bars from appearing in iFrames so that they could be blended with surrounding content on a page. Though this element does not appear in the latest revision.The scrollbar BarProp object is a child of the window object and represents the user interface element that contains a scrolling mechanism, or some similar interface concept. window.scrollbars.visible will return true if the scroll bars are visible.The History API also includes features for scroll restoration on page navigation to persist the scroll position on page load.window.history.scrollRestoration can be used to check the status of scrollrestoration or change its status (appending ="auto"/"manual". Auto is the default value. Changing it to manual means that you as the developer will take ownership of any scroll changes that may be required when a user traverses the app's history. If you need to, you can keep track of the scroll position as you push history entries with history.pushState().You can accomplish this with a wrapper div that has its overflow hidden, and the inner div set to auto.To remove the inner div's scroll bar, you can pull it out of the outer div's viewport by applying a negative margin to the inner div. Then apply equal padding to the inner div so that the content stays in view.JSFiddleThis works for me with simple CSS properties:For older versions of Firefox, use: overflow: -moz-scrollbars-none;Here's my solution, which theoretically covers all modern browsers:html can be replaced with any element you want to hide the scrollbar of.Note: I've skimmed the other 19 answers to see if the code I'm posting has already been covered, and it seems like no single answer sums up the situation as it stands in 2019, although plenty of them go into excellent detail.

impractical for grabbing with a mouse, are quite beautiful and neutral.To hide scrollbars, a technique by John Kurlak works well except for leaving

Firefox users who don't have touchpads with no way to scroll unless they

have a mouse with a wheel, which they probably do, but even then they can usually

only scroll vertically.John's technique uses three elements:It must be possible to set the size of the outer and content elements the same

which eliminates using percentages, but I can't think of anything else that

won't work with the right tweaking.My biggest concern is whether all versions of browsers set scrollbars to make

visible overflowed content visible. I have tested in current browsers, but

not older ones.Pardon my SASS ;POS X is 10.6.8. Windows is Windows 7. I just thought I'd point out to anyone else reading this question that setting overflow: hidden (or overflow-y) on the body element didn't hide the scrollbars for me.I had to use the html element.I wrote a WebKit version with some options like auto hide, little version, scroll only-y, or only-x:http://codepen.io/hicTech/pen/KmKrjbCopy this CSS code to the customer code for hiding the scroll bar:My HTML is like this:Add this to your div where you want to hide the scrollbar:And add this to the containerTo disable the vertical scroll bar, just add overflow-y:hidden;.Find more about it: overflow.My answer will scroll even when overflow:hidden;, using jQuery:For example, scroll horizontally with the mouse wheel:I believe you can manipulate it with the overflow CSS attribute, but they have limited browser support. One source said it was Internet Explorer 5 (and later), Firefox 1.5 (and later), and Safari 3 (and later) - maybe enough for your purposes.Scrolling, Scrolling, Scrolling has a good discussion.

Given the following HTML:I would like #copyright to stick to the bottom of #container.Can I achieve this without using absolute positioning? If the float property supported a value of 'bottom' it seems that would do the trick, but unfortunately, it doesn't.Likely not.Assign position:relative to #container, and then position:absolute; bottom:0; to #copyright.Actually, the accepted answer by @User will only work if the window is tall and the content is short. But if the content is tall and the window is short, it will put the copyright info over the page content, and then scrolling down to see the content will leave you with a floating copyright notice. That makes this solution useless for most pages (like this page, actually).The most common way of doing this is the "CSS sticky footer" approach demonstrated, or a slightly slimmer variation. This approach works great -- IF you have a fixed height footer.If you need a variable height footer that will appear at the bottom of the window if the content is too short, and at the bottom of the content if the window is too short, what do you do?Swallow your pride and use a table.For example:Try it out. This will work for any window size, for any amount of content, for any size footer, on every browser... even IE6.If you're cringing at the thought of using a table for layout, take a second to ask yourself why. CSS was supposed to make our lives easier -- and it has, overall -- but the fact is that even after all these years, it's still a broken, counter-intuitive mess. It can't solve every problem. It's incomplete.Tables aren't cool, but at least for now, they are sometimes the best way to solve a design problem.In supported browsers, you can use the following:Example HereThe solution above is probably more flexible, however, here is an alternative solution:Example HereAs a side note, you may want to add vendor prefixes for additional support.Yes you can do this without absolute positioning and without using tables (which screw with markup and such).DEMO

This is tested to work on IE>7, chrome, FF & is a really easy thing to add to your existing layout.It effectively does what float:bottom would, even accounting for the issue pointed out in @Rick Reilly's answer!Its an old question, but this is a unique approach that can help in several cases.check out that Working FiddleBecause normal flow is 'top-to-bottom' we can't simply ask the #copyright div to stick to the bottom of his parent without absolutely positioning of some sort, But if we wanted the #copyright div to stick to the top of his parent, it will be very simple - because this is the normal flow way.So we will use this in our advantage.

we will change the order of the divs in the HTML, now the #copyright div is at the top, and the content follow it right away.

we also make the content div stretch all the way (using pseudo elements and clearing techniques)now it's just a matter of inverting that order back in the view. that can be easily done with CSS transform.We rotate the container by 180deg, and now: up-is-down. (and we inverse back the content to look normal again)If we want to have a scroolbar within the content area, we need to apply a little bit more of CSS magic. as can be showed Here [in that example, the content is below a header - but its the same idea]Create another container div for the elements above #copyright. Just above copyright add a new div:

   <div style="clear:both;"></div>

It will force the footer to be under everything else, just like in the case of using relative positioning (bottom:0px;).Try this;While none of the answers provided here seemed to apply or work in my particular case, I came across this article which provides this neat solution :I find it very useful for applying responsive design for mobile display without having to reorder all the html code of a website, setting body itself as a table.Note that only the first table-footer-group or table-header-group will be rendered as such : if there are more than one, the others will be rendered as table-row-group.You can indeed align the box to the bottom without using position:absolute if you know the height of the #container using the text alignment feature of inline-block elements.Here you can see it in action.This is the code:Just set element child to position: relative and than move it top: 100% (that's the 100% height of the parent) and stick to bottom of parent by transform: translateY(-100%) (that's -100% of the height of the child).BenefitSBut still just workaround :(Don't forget prefixes for the older browser.CodePen link here.Since the usage of CSS Grid is increasing, I would like to suggest align-self to the element that is inside a grid container.align-self can contain any of the values: end, self-end, flex-end for the following example.If you want it to "stick" to the bottom, regardless of the height of container, then absolute positioning is the way to go. Of course, if the copyright element is the last in the container it'll always be at the bottom anyway.Can you expand on your question? Explain exactly what you're trying to do (and why you don't want to use absolute positioning)?Also, if there's stipulations with using position:absolute; or position:relative;, you can always try padding parent div or putting a margin-top:x;. Not a very good method in most cases, but it may come in handy in some cases.Maybe this helps someone: You can always place the div outside the other div and then push it upwards using negative margin:Don't wanna use "position:absolute" for sticky footer at bottom. Then you can do this way:If you do not know the height of child block:http://jsbin.com/ULUXIFon/3/editIf you know the height of the child block add the child block then add padding-top/margin-top:Just because this hasn't been mentioned at all, what usually works well in situations like yours: Placing the copyright-div after the container-divYou would only have to format the copyright-div in a similar way to the other container (same overall width, centering, etc.), and all is fine.CSS:HTML:The only time this might not be ideal is when your container-div is declared with height:100%, and the user would need to scroll down to see the copyright. But even still you could work around (e.g. margin-top:-20px - when the height of your copyright element is 20px).Aside: I know the OP asked for a solution that "... sticks to the bottom of the 'container' div ...", and not something under it, but come on, people are looking for good solutions here, and this is one!Here is an approach targeted at making an element with a known height and width (at least approximately) float to the right and stay at the bottom, while behaving as an inline element to the other elements. It is focused at the bottom-right because you can place it easily in any other corner through other methods.I needed to make a navigation bar which would have the actual links at the bottom right, and random sibling elements, while ensuring that the bar itself stretched properly, without disrupting the layout. I used a "shadow" element to occupy the navigation bar's links' space and added it at the end of the container's child nodes.There is nothing called float:bottom in CSS. The best way is using positioning in such cases:For those only have one child in the container, you can use the table-cell and vertical-align approach which worked reliably for positioning a single div at the bottom of its parent.Note that using table-footer-group as other answers mentioned will break the height calculation of parent table.According: w3schools.comSo you need to position the parent element with something either relative or absolute, etc and position the desired element to absolute and latter set bottom to 0.Div of style, position:absolute;bottom:5px;width:100%; is working, 

But it required more scrollup situation.

I am having trouble applying a style that is !important. I’ve tried:This does nothing; no width style whatsoever is applied. Is there a jQuery-ish way of applying such a style without having to overwrite cssText (which would mean I’d need to parse it first, etc.)?Edit: I should add that I have a stylesheet with an !important style that I am trying to override with an !important style inline, so using .width() and the like does not work since it gets overridden by my external !important style.Also, the value that will override the previous value is computed, so I cannot simply create another external style.The problem is caused by jQuery not understanding the !important attribute, and as such fails to apply the rule.You might be able to work around that problem, and apply the rule by referring to it, via addClass():Or by using attr():The latter approach would unset any previously set in-line style rules, though. So use with care.Of course, there's a good argument that @Nick Craver's method is easier/wiser.The above, attr() approach modified slightly to preserve the original style string/properties, and modified as suggested by falko in a comment:I think I've found a real solution. I've made it into a new function:jQuery.style(name, value, priority);You can use it to get values with .style('name') just like .css('name'), get the CSSStyleDeclaration with .style(), and also set values - with the ability to specify the priority as 'important'. See this.Here's the output:See this for examples of how to read and set the CSS values. My issue was that I had already set !important for the width in my CSS to avoid conflicts with other theme CSS, but any changes I made to the width in jQuery would be unaffected since they would be added to the style attribute.For setting with the priority using the setProperty function, This Article says there is support for IE 9+ and all other browsers. I have tried with IE 8 and it has failed, which is why I built support for it in my functions (see above). It will work on all other browsers using setProperty, but it will need my custom code to work in < IE 9.You can set the width directly using .width() like this:Updated for comments:

You have this option as well, but it'll replace all css on the element, so not sure it's any more viable:Note:

Using Chrome may return an error such as:Changing the line to use the .removeProperty function such as to elem[0].style.removeProperty('width'); fixed the issue.David Thomas’s answer describes a way to use $('#elem').attr('style', …), but warns that using it will delete previously-set styles in the style attribute. Here is a way of using attr() without that problem:As a function:Here is a JS Bin demo.After reading other answers and experimenting, this is what works for me:This doesn't work in IE 8 and under, though.You can do this:Using "cssText" as the property name and whatever you want added to the CSS as its value.You can achieve this in two ways:There's no need to go to the complexity of @AramKocharyan's answer, nor the need to insert any style tags dynamically.Just overwrite style, but you don't have to parse anything, why would you?

Can't use removeProperty(), because it won't remove !important rules in Chrome.

Can't use element.style[property] = '', because it only accepts camelCase in Firefox.

You could probably make this shorter with jQuery, but this vanilla function will run on modern browsers, Internet Explorer 8, etc.Here is what I did after encountering this problem...This solution doesn't override any of the previous styles, it just applies the one you need:If it is not so relevant and since you're dealing with one element which is #elem, you can change its id to something else and style it as you wish...And in your CSS:Instead of using the css() function try the addClass() function:The easiest and best solution for this problem from me was to simply use addClass() instead of .css() or .attr().For example:$('#elem').addClass('importantClass');And in your CSS file:FYI, it doesn't work because jQuery doesn't support it. There was a ticket filed on 2012 (#11173 $(elem).css("property", "value !important") fails) that was eventually closed as WONTFIX.We need first to remove the previous style. I remove it using a regular expression. Here is an example for changing color:An alternative way to append style in head:This appends style after all your CSS files so it will have higher priority than other CSS files and will be applied.May be it look's like this:I think it works OK and can overwrite any other CSS before (this: DOM element):Do it like this:This solution will leave all the computed javascript and add the important tag into the element:

You can do (Ex if you need to set the width with the important tag)I had a similar situation, but I used .find() after struggling with .closest() for a long time with many variations.Working: http://jsfiddle.net/fx4mbp6c/It may or may not be appropriate for your situation but you can use CSS selectors for a lot of these type of situations. If, for example you wanted of the 3rd and 6th instances of .cssText to have a different width you could write:Or:I would assume you tried it without adding !important?Inline CSS (which is how JavaScript adds styling) overrides the stylesheet CSS. I'm pretty sure that's the case even when the stylesheet CSS rule has !important.Another question (maybe a stupid question but must be asked.):  Is the element you are trying to work on display:block; or display:inline-block;?Not knowing your expertise in CSS...  inline elements don't always behave as you would expect.We can use setProperty or cssText to add !important to a DOM element using JavaScript.Example 1:Example 2:Most of these answers are now outdated, IE7 support is not an issue.The best way to do this that supports IE11+ and all modern browsers is:Or if you want, you can create a small jQuery plugin that does this.

This plugin closely matches jQuery's own css() method in the parameters it supports:Example jsfiddle here.I also discovered that certain elements or add-on's (like Bootstrap) have some special class cases where they do not play well with !important or other work-arounds like .addClass/.removeClass, and thus you have to to toggle them on/off. For example, if you use something like <table class="table-hover">the only way to successfully modify elements like colors of rows is to toggle the table-hover class on/off, like this$(your_element).closest("table").toggleClass("table-hover"); Hopefully this work-around will be helpful to someone! :)I had the same problem trying to change a text color of a menu-item when "event". The best way I found when I had this same problem was:First step: Create, in your CSS, a new class with this purpose, for example:Last step: Apply this class using the addClass method as follows:Problem solved.The safest workaround to this is to add a class and then do the magic in CSS :-), addClass() and removeClass() should do the work.https://jsfiddle.net/xk6Ut/256/An alternative approach is  dynamically creating and updating CSS class in JavaScript. To do that, we can use style element and need to employ the ID for the style element so that we can update the CSS class...

Is there a set of classes in Twitter's Bootstrap framework that aligns text?For example, I have some tables with $ totals that I want aligned to the right...andv3 Text Alignment Docsv4 Text Alignment DocsUsing Bootstrap 3.x using text-right works perfectly:No, Bootstrap doesn't have a class for that, but this kind of class is considered a "utility" class, similar to the ".pull-right" class that @anton mentioned. If you look at utilities.less you will see very few utility classes in Bootstrap, the reason being that this kind of class is generally frowned upon, and is recommended to be used for either:

 a) prototyping and development - so you can quickly build out your pages, then remove the pull-right and pull-left classes in favor of applying floats to more semantic classes or to the elements themselves, or 

 b) when it's clearly more practical than a more semantic solution. In your case, by your question it looks like you wish to have certain text align on the right in your table, but not all of it. Semantically, it would be better to do something like (I'm just going to make up a few classes here, except for the default bootstrap class, .table): And just apply the text-align: left or text-align: right declarations to the price-value and price-label classes (or whatever classes work for you). The problem with applying align-right as a class, is that if you want to refactor your tables you will have to redo the markup and the styles. If you use semantic classes you might be able to get away with refactoring only the CSS content. Plus, if are taking the time to apply a class to an element, it's best practice to try to assign semantic value to that class so that the markup is easier to navigate for other programmers (or you three months later).One way to think of it is this: when you pose the question "What is this td for?", you will not get clarification from the answer "align-right".Bootstrap 2.3 has utility classes text-left, text-right, and text-center, but they do not work in table cells. Until Bootstrap 3.0 is released (where they have fixed the issue) and I am able to make the switch, I have added this to my site CSS that is loaded after bootstrap.css:Just add a "custom" stylesheet which is loaded after Bootstrap´s stylesheet. So the class definitions are overloaded.In this stylesheet declare the alignment as follows:Now you are able to use the "common" alignment conventions for td and th elements.I guess because CSS already has text-align:right, AFAIK, Bootstrap doesn't have a special class for it.Bootstrap does have "pull-right" for floating divs, etc. to the right.Bootstrap 2.3 just came out and added text alignment styles:Bootstrap 2.3 released (2013-02-07)Bootstrap 4 is coming! The utility classes made familiar in Bootstrap 3.x are now break-point enabled. The default breakpoints are: xs, sm, md, lg and xl, so these text alignment classes look something like .text-[breakpoint]-[alignnment].Important: As of writing this, Bootstrap 4 is only in Alpha 2. These classes and how they're used are subject to change without notice.Bootstrap text alignment in v3.3.5:CodePen exampleThe following lines of code are working properly. You can assign the classes like text-center, left or right, The text will align accordingly.Here there isn't any need to create any external class. These are the Bootstrap classes and have their own property.You can use this CSS below:The .text-align class is totally valid and more usable than having a .price-label and .price-value which are of no use any more.I recommend going 100% with a custom utility class calledI like to do some magic, but that is up to you, like something:Expanding on David's answer, I just add a simple class to augment Bootstrap like this:Ow, with the release of Bootstrap 3, you can use the classes of text-center for center alignment, text-left for left alignment, text-right for right alignment and text-justify for a justified alignment.Bootstrap is a very simple frontend framework to work with, once you utilize it. As well as being very easy to customize to fit your liking.Here is a short and sweet answer with an example.We have five classes for that, which you can refer from here:

It'd be weird and inconvenient if they didn't.You can use a translucent PNG file for your background image, or use an RGBa (a for alpha) color for your background color.Example, 50% faded black background:You can use CSS 3 :before to have a semi-transparent background and you can do this with just one container. Use something like thisThen apply some CSSSample: http://codepen.io/anon/pen/avdsiNote: You might need to adjust the z-index values. The following methods can be used to solve your problem:For more details regarding this technique, see this, which has an online CSS generator.I would do something like thisCSS:It should work. This is assuming you are required to have a semi-transparent image BTW, and not a color (which you should just use rgba for). Also assumed is  that you can't just alter the opacity of the image beforehand in Photoshop.You can use Sass' transparentize.I found it to be the most useful and plain to use.See more: #transparentize($color, $amount) ⇒ Sass::Script::Value::Color This is because the inner div has 100% of the opacity of the div it is nested in (which has 40% opacity).In order to circumvent it, there are a few things you could do.You could create two separate divs like so:Set your desired CSS opacity and other properties for the background and use the z-index property (z-index) to style and position the bContent div. With this you can place the div overtope of the background div without having it's opacity mucked with.Another option is to RGBa. This will allow you to nest your divs and still achieve div specific opacity.The last option is to simply make a semi transparent .png image of the color you want in your desired image editor of choice, set the background-image property to the URL of the image and then you won't have to worry about mucking about with the CSS and losing the capability and organization of a nested div structure.Just make sure to put width and height for the foreground the same with the background, or try to have top, bottom, left and right properties.

Or am I missing something?Edit: But see Shawn's caveat about accidentally upsizing.works for me. It scales down larger images to fit in the box, but leaves smaller images their original size.Use this easy scaling technique I believe this is the easiest way to do it, also possible using through the inline style attribute within the <img> tag.orwith this snippet you can do it in a more efficient wayWe can resize image using CSS in the browser using media queries and the principle of responsive design.You always need something like thisat the top of your css fileTry this:image_tag("/icons/icon.gif", height: '32', width: '32')

Is there a way to get a background in CSS to stretch or scale to fill its container?

Is there a way to get a background in CSS to stretch or scale to fill its container?For modern browsers, you can accomplish this by using background-size:cover means stretching the image either vertically or horizontally so it never tiles/repeats.That would work for Safari 3 (or later), Chrome, Opera 10+, Firefox 3.6+, and Internet Explorer 9 (or later).For it to work with lower verions of Internet Explorer, try these CSS:Use the CSS 3 property background-size:This is available for modern browsers, since 2012.Scaling an image with CSS is not quite possible, but a similar effect can be achieved in the following manner, though.Use this markup:with the following CSS:and you should be done!In order to scale the image to be "full bleed" and maintain the aspect ratio, you can do this instead:It works out quite nicely! If one dimension is cropped, however, it will be cropped on only one side of the image, rather than being evenly cropped on both sides (and centered). I've tested it in Firefox, Webkit, and Internet Explorer 8.Use the background-size attribute  in CSS3:EDIT: Modernizr supports detection of background-size support. You can use a JavaScript workaround written to work however you need it and load it dynamically when there is no support. This will keep the code maintainable without resorting to intrusive CSS hacks for certain browsers.Personally I use a script to deal with it using jQuery, its an adaption of imgsizer. As most designs I do now use width %'s for fluid layouts across devices there is a slight adaptation to one of the loops (accounting for sizes that aren't always 100%):EDIT:

http://css-tricks.com/perfect-full-page-background-image/In one word: no. The only way to stretch an image is with the <img> tag. You'll have to be creative.This used to be true in 2008, when the answer was written. Today modern browsers support background-size which solves this problem. Beware that IE8 doesn't support it.Define "stretch and scale"...If you've got a bitmap format, it's generally not great (graphically speaking) to stretch it and pull it about.  You can use repeatable patterns to give the illusion of the same effect.  For instance if you have a gradient that gets lighter towards the bottom of the page, then you would use a graphic that's a single pixel wide and the same height as your container (or preferably larger to account for scaling) and then tile it across the page.  Likewise, if the gradient ran across the page, it would be one pixel high and wider than your container and repeated down the page.Normally to give the illusion of it stretching to fill the container when the container grows or shrinks, you make the image larger than the container.  Any overlap would not be displayed outside the bounds of the container.If you want an effect that relies on something like a box with curved edges, then you would stick the left side of your box to the left side of your container with enough overlap that (within reason) no matter how large the container, it never runs out of background and then you layer an image of the right side of the box with curved edges and position it on the right of the container.  Thus as the container shrinks or grows, the curved box effect appears to shrink or grow with it - it doesn't in fact, but it gives the illusion that is what's happening.As for really making the image shrink and grow with the container, you would need to use some layering tricks to make the image appear to function as a background and some javascript to resize it with the container.  There's no current way of doing this with CSS...If you're using vector graphics, you're way outside my realm of expertise I'm afraid.This is what I've made of it. In the stretch class, I simply changed the height to auto. This way your background picture has always got the same size as the width of the screen and the height will allways have the right size.Add a background-attachment line:I would like to point out that this is equivalent to doing:Another great solution for this is Srobbin's Backstretch which can be applied to the body or any element on the page - http://srobbin.com/jquery-plugins/backstretch/Try thishttp://jsfiddle.net/5LZ55/4/An additional tip for SolidSmile's cheat is to scale (the proportionate re-sizing) by setting a width and using auto for height.Ex: Use the border-image : yourimage property to set your image and scale it upto the entire border of your screen or window .

Getting Safari to remove this little bit of flare would be nice.In your case, try:Or in general, to affect all basic form elements:In the comments, Noah Whitmore suggested taking this even further to support elements that have the contenteditable attribute set to true (effectively making them a type of input element). The following should target those as well (in CSS3 capable browsers):Although I wouldn't recommend it, for completeness' sake, you could always disable the focus outline on everything with this:Keep in mind that the focus outline is an accessibility and usability feature; it clues the user into what element is currently focused.To remove it from all inputsThis is an old thread, but for reference it's important to note that disabling an input element's outline is not recommended as it hinders accessibility.The outline property is there for a reason - providing users with a clear indication of keyboard focus. For further reading and additional sources about this subject see http://outlinenone.com/The default outline that browsers render is ugly.See this for example:The most common "fix" that most recommend is outline:none - which if used incorrectly - is disaster for accessibility. There's a very dry-cut website I found which explains everything well. Ok, let's try it out same example as above, now use the TAB key to navigate. Notice how you can tell where the focus is even without clicking the input? Now, let's try outline:none on our trusty <input>So, once again, use the TAB key to navigate after clicking the text and see what happens.See how it's more difficult to figure out where the focus is? The only telling sign is the cursor blinking. My example above is overly simplistic. In real-world situations, you wouldn't have only one element on the page. Something more along the lines of this. Now compare that to the same template if we keep the outline:So we have established the following Remove the ugly outline and add your own visual cues to indicate focus. Here's a very simple example of what I mean. I remove the outline and add a bottom border on :focus and :active. I also remove the default borders on the top, left and right sides by setting them to transparent on :focus and :active (personal preference)So, we try the approach above with our "real-world" example from earlier:This can be extended further by using external libraries that build on the idea of modifying the "outline" as opposed to removing it entirely like MaterializeYou can end up with something that is not ugly and works with very little effortThis was confusing me for some time until I discovered the line was neither a border or an outline, it was a shadow. So to remove it I had to use this:You could use CSS to disable that!

This is the code I use for disabling the blue border:This will remove the blue border!This is a working example: JSfiddle.netHope it helps!Removing all focus styles is bad for accessibility and keyboard users in general. But outlines are ugly and providing a custom focussed style for every single interactive element can be a real pain.So the best compromise I've found is to show the outline styles only when we detect that the user is using the keyboard to navigate. Basically, if the user presses TAB, we show the outlines and if he uses the mouse, we hide them.It does not stop you from writing custom focus styles for some elements but at least it provides a good default.This is how I do it:Use this code:I tried all the answers and I still couldn't get mine to work on Mobile, until I found -webkit-tap-highlight-color.So, what worked for me is...None of the solutions worked for me in Firefox. The following solution changes the border style on focus for Firefox and sets the outline to none for other browsers. I've effectively made the focus border go from a 3px blue glow to a border style that matches the text area border. Here's some border styles:   Dashed border (border 2px dashed red): 

No border! (border 0px):

Textarea border (border 1px solid gray): 

Here is the code:

Using CSS, how can I apply more than one transform?Example: In the following, only the translation is applied, not the rotation.

2012-05-26 11:15:52Z

Using CSS, how can I apply more than one transform?Example: In the following, only the translation is applied, not the rotation.You have to put them on one line like this:When you have multiple transform directives, only the last one will be applied. It's like any other CSS rule.Keep in mind multiple transform one line directives are applied from right to left.This: transform: scale(1,1.5) rotate(90deg);

and: transform: rotate(90deg) scale(1,1.5);will not produce the same result:I'm adding this answer not because it's likely to be helpful but just because it's true.In addition to using the existing answers explaining how to make more than one translation by chaining them, you can also construct the 4x4 matrix yourselfI grabbed the following image from some random site I found while googling which shows rotational matrices:Rotation around x axis: 

Rotation around y axis: 

Rotation around z axis: I couldn't find a good example of translation, so assuming I remember/understand it right, translation:See more at the Wikipedia article on transformation as well as the Pragamatic CSS3 tutorial which explains it rather well. Another guide I found which explains arbitrary rotation matrices is Egon Rath's notes on matricesMatrix multiplication works between these 4x4 matrices of course, so to perform a rotation followed by a translation, you make the appropriate rotation matrix and multiply it by the translation matrix.This can give you a bit more freedom to get it just right, and will also make it pretty much completely impossible for anyone to understand what it's doing, including you in five minutes.But, you know, it works.Edit: I just realized that I missed mentioning probably the most important and practical use of this, which is to incrementally create complex 3D transformations via JavaScript, where things will make a bit more sense.You can also apply multiple transforms using an extra layer of markup e.g.:This can be really useful when animating elements with transforms using Javascript.You can apply more than one transform like this:Some time in the future, we can write it like this:This will become especially useful when applying individual classes on an element:This syntax is defined in the in-progress CSS Transforms Level 2 specification, but can't find anything about current browser support other then chrome canary. Hope some day i'll come back and update browser support here ;)Found the info in this article which you might want to check out regarding workarounds for current browsers.Just start from there that in CSS, if you repeat 2 values or more, always last one gets applied, unless using !important tag, but at the same time avoid using !important as much as you can, so in your case that's the problem, so the second transform override the first one in this case...So how you can do what you want then?...Don't worry, transform accepts multiple values at the same time... So this code below will work:If you like to play around with transform run the iframe from MDN below:

Look at the link below for more info:<< CSS transform >>Transform Rotate and Translate in single line css:-How?A simple way to apply multiple transform is thisBut also don't forget that you need to add prefix to let it work in all browsers as some browers like safari, IE not support tranform property without prefix.For exampleI am using enjoycss tool http://enjoycss.com/5C#transformit generates css code for required parameters of transform using GUI to generate the transfrom code ;)

I'm trying to follow a very basic example.  Using the starter page and the grid system, I was hoping the following:...would produce centered text.However, it still appears on the far left. What am I doing wrong?For other types of content, see Flavien's answer.Update: Bootstrap 2.3.0+ AnswerThe original answer was for an early version of bootstrap. As of bootstrap 2.3.0, you can simply give the div the class .text-center.Original Answer (pre 2.3.0)You need to define one of the two classes, row or span12 with a text-align: center. See http://jsfiddle.net/xKSUH/ or http://jsfiddle.net/xKSUH/1/NOTE: this was removed in Bootstrap 3.Pre-Bootstrap 3, you could use the CSS class pagination-centered like this:Class pagination-centered is already in bootstrap.css (or bootstrap.min.css) and has the only one rule:With Bootstrap 2.3.0. just use class text-centerI guess most of the people here are actually searching for the way to center the whole div and not only the text content (which is trivial…).The second way (instead of using text-align:center) to center things in HTML is to have an element with a fixed width and auto margin (left and right). With Bootstrap, the style defining auto margins is the "container" class.Take a look here for a fiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/D2RLR/7788/"Centered content" can mean many different things, and Bootstrap centering has changed a lot since the original post.Bootstrap 3Demo Bootstrap 3 Horizontal CenteringBootstrap 4mx-auto (auto x-axis margins) will center display:block or display:flex elements that have a defined width, (%, vw, px, etc..). Flexbox is used by default on grid columns, so there are also various flexbox centering methods.Demo Bootstrap 4 Horizontal CenteringNow that Bootstrap 4 is flexbox by default there are many different approaches to vertical alignment using: auto-margins, flexbox utils, or the display utils along with vertical align utils. At first "vertical align utils" seems obvious but these only work with inline and table display elements. Here are some Bootstrap 4 vertical centering options..1 - Vertical Center Using Auto Margins:Another way to vertically center is to use my-auto. This will center the element within it's container. For example, h-100 makes the row full height, and my-auto will vertically center the col-sm-12 column.Vertical Center Using Auto Margins Demomy-auto represents margins on the vertical y-axis and is equivalent to:2 - Vertical Center with Flexbox:Since Bootstrap 4 .row is now display:flex you can simply use align-self-center on any column to vertically center it...or, use align-items-center on the entire .row to vertically center align all col-* in the row...Vertical Center Different Height Columns Demo3 - Vertical Center Using Display Utils:Bootstrap 4 has display utils that can be used for display:table, display:table-cell, display:inline, etc.. These can be used with the vertical alignment utils to align inline, inline-block or table cell elements.Vertical Center Using Display Utils DemoBootstrap 3.1.1 has a .center-block class for centering divs. See: http://getbootstrap.com/css/#helper-classes-center.Or, as others have already said, use the .text-center class to centre text.The best way to do this is define a css style:Then where ever you need centered text you add it like so:or if you just want the p tag centered:The less inline css you use the better.The class .show-grid is applying center aligned text in the example in the link.You can always add style="text-align:center" to your row div or some other class I would think.As of February 2013, in some cases, I add a "centred" class to the "span" div:and to CSS:The reason for this is because the span* div's get floated to the left, and the "auto margin" centering technique works only if the div is not floated.Demo (on JSFiddle): http://jsfiddle.net/5RpSh/8/embedded/result/JSFiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/5RpSh/8/If you use Bootstrap 3, it also has built-in CSS class named .text-center. That's what you want.Please see the example in jsfiddle. http://jsfiddle.net/ucheng/Q4Fue/Bootstrap 2.3 has a text-center class. On my side I define new CSS styles ready to use and easy to remember:Is it a good idea? 

Is there any good practice for this?If you are using Bootstrap 2.0+This can make the div centered to the page.Any text-align utility class would do the trick. Bootstrap has been using .text-center class for centering text for a long time now.Or you can create your own utilities. Some variations I've seen over the years:You need to adjust with the .span.Example:My preferred method for centering blocks of information while maintaining responsiveness (mobile compatibility) is to place two empty span1 divs before and after the content you wish to center.For Bootstrap version 3.1.1 and above, the best class for centering the content is the .center-block helper class.Do not use container-fluid in the main.Center-block is also an option not referred in above answersAll the class center-block does is to tell the element to have a margin of 0 auto, the auto being the left/right margins. However, unless the class text-center or css text-align:center; is set on the parent, the element does not know the point to work out this auto calculation from, so it will not center itself as anticipated.So text-center is a better option.You can use any one of the below typesI created this class to keep the  centered regardless of screen size while maintaining responsive features:Simply use a class, text-center, for the div or tag which you want. I think it may work fine. It is a Bootstrap class for text align center.Here are some text alignment Bootstrap classes:I tried two ways, and it worked fine to center the div. Both the ways will align the divs on all screens.Way 1: Using Push:Way 2: Using Offset:Result:ExplanationBootstrap will designate to the left, the first column of the specified screen-occupancy. If we use offset or push it will shift the 'this' column by 'those' many columns. Though I faced some issues in responsiveness of offset, push was awesome.Update 2018:In Bootstrap 4.1.3, content can be centered using class mx-auto.Reference: https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.1/utilities/spacing/#horizontal-centering

Why isn't there a fancy file element upload button for twitter bootstrap? It would be sweet if the blue primary button was implemented for the upload button. Is it even possible to finesse the upload button using CSS? (seems like a native browser element that can't be manipulated) Here's a solution for Bootstrap 3 and 4.To make a functional file input control that looks like a button, you only need HTML:HTMLThis works in all modern browsers, including IE9+. If you need support for old IE as well, please use the legacy approach shown below.This techniques relies on the HTML5 hidden attribute. Bootstrap 4 uses the following CSS to shim this feature in unsupportive browsers. You may need to add if you're using Bootstrap 3.If you need support for IE8 and below, use the following HTML/CSS:HTMLCSSNote that old IE doesn't trigger the file input when you click on a <label>, so the The CSS "bloat" does a couple things to work around that:I've posted more details about this method, as well as examples for how to show the user which/how many files are selected:http://www.abeautifulsite.net/whipping-file-inputs-into-shape-with-bootstrap-3/Im surprised there was no mention of the <label> element.Solution:No need for any JS, or funky css...Solution for including the filename:The solution above requires jQuery.With no additional plugin required, this bootstrap solution works great for me:demo: http://jsfiddle.net/haisumbhatti/cAXFA/1/ (bootstrap 2)http://jsfiddle.net/haisumbhatti/y3xyU/   (bootstrap 3)It's included in Jasny's fork of bootstrap.A simple upload button can be created usingWith the fileupload plugin you can create more advanced widgets. Have a look at

http://jasny.github.io/bootstrap/javascript/#fileinputUpload buttons are a pain to style because it styles the input and not the button.but you can use this trick:http://www.quirksmode.org/dom/inputfile.htmlSummary:Works for me: jQuery plugin style:Simplified answer using parts from other answers, primarily user2309766 and dotcomsuperstar.Features:Code:With some inspiration from other posts above, here is a full solution that combines what looks like a form-control field with an input-group-addon for a clean file input widget that includes a link to the current file.Please check out Twitter Bootstrap File Input.

In this way the label shows the file name, if only one is selected, or x files in the opposite case.It may also apply to change the button text and class.I have Created a Custom upload button to accept only images, which can be modified as per your requirement.Hope this helps!! :)(Used Bootstrap framework)Codepen-linkHTMLCSSJSthis is the best file upload style I like:you can get demo and more styles at:http://www.jasny.net/bootstrap/javascript/#fileinputbut using this, you should replace twitter bootstrap with jasny bootstrap files..regards.Based on the absolutely brilliant @claviska solution, to whom all the credit is owed.Based on the input group example we have a dummy input text field used for displaying the filename to the user, which gets populated from the onchange event on the actual input file field hidden behind the label button. Aside from including the bootstrap 4 validation support we've also made it possible to click anywhere on the input to open the file dialog.The three possible states are un-validated, valid and invalid with the dummy html input tag attribute required set.We introduce only 2 custom classes input-file-dummy and input-file-btn to properly style and wire the desired behaviour. Everything else is standard Bootstrap 4 markup.The dummy input needs to be read only, as per the original example, to prevent the user from changing the input which may only be changed via the open file dialog. Unfortunately validation does not occur on readonly fields so we toggle the editability of the input on focus and blur ( jquery events onfocusin and onfocusout) and ensure that it becomes validatable again once a file is selected.Aside from also making the text field clickable, by triggering the button's click event, the rest of the functionality of populating the dummy field was envisioned by @claviska.Most importantly we don't want the readonly field to jump between grey background and white so we ensure it stays white. The span button doesn't have a pointer cursor but we need to add one for the input anyway.nJoy!I use http://gregpike.net/demos/bootstrap-file-input/demo.html:or/*

I have a <div> block with some fancy visual content that I don't want to change. I want to make it a clickable link.I'm looking for something like <a href="…"><div> … </div></a>, but that is valid XHTML 1.1.Came here in the hope of finding a better solution that mine, but I don't like any of the ones on offer here. I think some of you have misunderstood the question. The OP wants to make a div full of content behave like a link. One example of this would be facebook ads - if you look, they're actually proper markup.For me the no-nos are: javascript (shouldn't be needed just for a link, and very bad SEO/accessibility); invalid HTML.In essence it's this:You can't make the div a link itself, but you can make an <a> tag act as a block, the same behaviour a <div> has.You can then set the width and height on it.This is an ancient question, but I thought I'd answer it since everyone here has some crazy solutions. It's actually very very simple...An anchor tag works like this - Sooo...Although I'm not sure if this is valid. If that's the reasoning behind spoken solutions, then I apologise...Requires a little javascript.

But, your div would be clickable.This option doesn’t require an empty.gif as in the most upvoted answer:HTML:CSS:As proposed at http://www.digitalskydesign.com/how-to-make-an-entire-div-a-link-using-css/This is a "valid" solution to achieving what you want.But most-likely what you really want is to have an <a> tag displayed as a block level element.I would not advise using JavaScript to simulate a hyperlink as that defeats the purpose of markup validation, which is ultimately to promote accessibility (publishing well-formed documents following proper semantic rules minimizes the possibility the same document will be interpreted differently by different browsers).It would be preferable to publish a web page that does not validate, but renders and functions properly on all browsers, including ones with JavaScript disabled. Furthermore, using onclick does not provide the semantic information for a screen reader to determine that the div is functioning as a link.Not sure if this is valid but it worked for me.The code :The cleanest way would be to use jQuery with the data-tags introduced in HTML. With this solution you can create a link on every tag you want. First define the tag (e.g. div) with a data-link tag:Now you can style the div however you want. And you have to create also the style for the "link"-alike behavior:And at last put this jQuery call to the page:With this code jQuery applys a click listener to every tag on the page which has a "data-link" attribute and redirects to the URL which is in the data-link attribute.To make thepeer's answer work in IE 7 and forward, it needs a few tweaks.you could also try by wrapping an anchor, then turning its height and width to be the same with its parent. This works for me perfectly.why not? use <a href="bla"> <div></div> </a> works fine in HTML5This post is Old I know but I just had to fix the same issue because simply writing  a normal link tag with the display set to block does not make the whole div clickable in IE. so to fix this issue far simpler than having to use JQuery. Firstly let us understand why this happens: IE wont make an empty div clickable it only make the text/image within that div/a tag clickable.Solution: Fill the div with a bakground image and hide it from the viewer.How?

You ask good questions, now listen up.

add this backround style to the a tag And there you have it the whole div is now clickable. This was the best way for me cause Im using it for my Photo Gallery to let the user clik on one half of the image to move left/right and then place a small image as well just for visual effects. so for me I used the left and right images as background images anyway!Just have the link in the block and enhance it with jquery. It degrades 100% gracefully for anyone without javascript. Doing this with html isn't really the best solution imho.

For example:Then use jquery to make the block clickable (via web designer wall):Then all you have to do is add cursor styles to the divFor bonus points only apply these styles if javascript is enabled by adding a 'js_enabled' class to the div, or the body, or whatever.This example worked for me:This worked for me:HTML:CSS:This adds an invisible element (the span), which covers your entire div, and is above your whole div on the z-index, so when someone clicks on that div, the click is essentially intercepted by your invisible "span" layer, which is linked.Note: If you're already using z-indexes for other elements, just make sure the value of this z-index is higher than anything you want it to rest "on top" of.Actually you need to include the JavaScript code at the moment,

check this tutorial to do so.but there is a tricky way to achieve this using a CSS code

you must nest an anchor tag inside your div tag and you must apply this property to it,when you've done that,it will make the whole width area clickable (but within the height of the anchor tag),if you want to cover the whole div area you must set the height of the anchor tag exactly to the height of the div tag,for example:this is gonna make the whole area clickable,then you can apply text-indent:-9999px to anchor tag to achieve the goal.this is really tricky and simple and it's just created using CSS code.here is an example: http://jsfiddle.net/hbirjand/RG8wW/This is the best way to do it as used on the BBC website and the Guardian:I found the technique here:

http://codepen.io/IschaGast/pen/Qjxpxoheres the htmlheres the CSSThis work for me:You can give a link to your div by following method:You can make surround the element with a href tags or you can use jquery and useThis is the simplest way.Say, this is the div block I want to make clickable:So put a href as follows:Just consider the div block as a normal html element and enable the usual a href tag. 

It works on FF at least.While I don't recommend doing this under any circumstance, here is some code that makes a DIV into a link (note: this example uses jQuery and certain markup is removed for simplicity):I pulled in  a variable because some values in my link will change depending on what record the user is coming from. 

This worked for testing :and this works too :My smarty pants answer:"Evasive answer to: "How to make block level element a hyperlink and validate in XHTML 1.1"Just use HTML5 DOCTYPE DTD."Didn't actually hold true for ie7onclick="location.href='page.html';"Works IE7-9, Chrome, Safari, Firefox, if just everything could be this simple...just think a little outside the box ;-)

I am working with images, and I ran across a problem with aspect ratios.As you can see, height and width are already specified. I added CSS rule for images:But for big_image.jpg, I receive width=500 and height=600. How I can set images to be re-sized, while keeping their aspect ratios.This will make image shrink if it's too big for specified area (as downside, it will not enlarge image).I've struggled with this problem quite hard, and eventually arrived at this simple solution:You can adjust the width and height to fit your needs, and the object-fit property will do the cropping for you.Cheers.The solutions below will allow scaling up and scaling down of the image, depending on the parent box width.All images have a parent container with a fixed width for demonstration purposes only. In production, this will be the width of the parent box.This solution tells the browser to render the image with max available width and adjust the height as a percentage of that width.With the fancier solution, you'll be able to crop the image regardless of its size and add a background color to compensate for the cropping.For the line specifying padding, you need to calculate the aspect ratio of the image, for example:So, top padding = 34.37%.The background-size property is ie>=9 only, but if that is fine with you, you can use a div with background-image and set background-size: contain:Now you can just set your div size to whatever you want and not only will the image keep its aspect ratio it will also be centralized both vertically and horizontally within the div. Just don't forget to set the sizes on the css since divs don't have the width/height attribute on the tag itself.This approach is different than setecs answer, using this the image area will be constant and defined by you (leaving empty spaces either horizontally or vertically depending on the div size and image aspect ratio), while setecs answer will get you a box that exactly the size of the scaled image (without empty spaces).Edit:

According to the MDN background-size documentation you can simulate the background-size property in IE8 using a proprietary filter declaration:Very similar to some answers here, but in my case I had images that  sometimes were taller, sometimes larger. This style worked like a charm to make sure that all images use all available space, keep the ratio and not cuts:Remove the "height" property.By specifying both you are changing the aspect ratio of the image. Just setting one will resize but preserve the aspect ratio.Optionally, to restrict oversizings:Just add this to your css, It will automaticly shrink and expand with keeping the original ratio.There is no standard way to preserve aspect ratio for images with width, height and max-width specified together.So we are forced either to specify width and height to prevent page「jumps」during loading images, or to use max-width and not specify dimensions for images.Specifying just width (without height) typically makes not much sense, but you can try to override the height HTML-attribute by adding a rule like IMG {height: auto; } into your stylesheet.See also the related Firefox bug 392261.Set the CSS class of your image container tag to image-class:and add this you your CSS stylesheet.To maintain a responsive image while still enforcing the image to have a certain aspect ratio you can do the following:HTML:And SCSS:This can be used to enforce a certain aspect ratio, regardless of the size of the image that authors upload.Thanks to @Kseso at  http://codepen.io/Kseso/pen/bfdhg. Check this URL for more ratios and a working example.To force image that fit in a exact size, you don't need to write too many codes. It's so simple https://jsfiddle.net/sot2qgj6/3/Here is the answer if you want to put image with fixed percentage of width, but not fixed pixel of width.And this will be useful when dealing with different size of screen.The tricks areI've also comment most of the tricks inside the fiddle.I also find some other ways to make this happen.

There will be no real image in html, so I personly perfer the top answer when I need "img" element in html.simple css by using background

http://jsfiddle.net/4660s79h/2/background-image with word on top

http://jsfiddle.net/4660s79h/1/the concept to use position absolute is from here

http://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_aspect_ratio.aspYou can use this:You can create a div like this:And use this css to style it:Here is a solution : This will make sure the image always covers the entire parent (scaling down and up) and keeps the same aspect ratio.This will make image shrink if it's too big for specified area (as downside, it will not enlarge image).The solution by setec is fine for "Shrink to Fit" in auto mode. 

But, to optimally EXPAND to fit in 'auto' mode, you need to first put the received image into a temp id, 

Check if it can be expanded in height or in width (depending upon its aspect ration v/s the aspect ratio of your display block),  This approach is useful when received images are smaller than display box. You must save them on your server in Original Small size rather than their expanded version to fill your Bigger display Box to save on size and bandwidth.How about using a pseudo element for vertical alignment? This less code is for a carousel but i guess it works on every fixed size container. It will keep the aspect ratio and insert @gray-dark bars on top/bottom or left/write for the shortest dimension. In the meanwhile the image is centered horizontally by the text-align and vertically by the pseudo element.Fullscreen presentation:Keep in mind that if the view-port height is greater than the image the image will naturally degrade relative to the difference.I would suggest for a responsive approach the best practice would be using the Viewport units and min/max attributes as follows:

Should I use 'border: none' or 'border: 0'?

[Should I use 'border: none' or 'border: 0'?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2922909/should-i-use-border-none-or-border-0)

Which of the two methods conforms to W3C standards? Do they both behave as expected across browsers?

2010-05-27 16:25:24Z

Which of the two methods conforms to W3C standards? Do they both behave as expected across browsers?Both are valid. It's your choice.I prefer border:0 because it's shorter; I find that easier to read. You may find none more legible. We live in a world of very capable CSS post-processors so I'd recommend you use whatever you prefer and then run it through a "compressor". There's no holy war worth fighting here.That all said, if you're hand-writing all your production CSS, I maintain —despite the grumbling in the comments— it doesn't hurt to be bandwidth conscious. Using border:0 will save an infinitesimal amount of bandwidth. On its own that counts for very little but if you make every byte count, you will make your website faster.The CSS2 specs are here. These are extended in CSS3 but not in any way relevant to this.You can use any combination of width, style and colour.

Here,  0 sets the width, none the style. They have the same rendering result: nothing is shown.They are equivalent in effect, pointing to different shortcuts:And the other..Both work, just pick one and go with it :)As others have said both are valid and will do the trick. I'm not 100% convinced that they are identical though. If you have some style cascading going on then they could in theory produce different results since they are effectively overriding different values.For example. If you set "border: none;" and then later on have two different styles that override the border width and style then one will do something and the other will not.In the following example on both IE and firefox the first two test divs come out with no border. The second two however are different with the first div in the second block being plain and the second div in the second block having a medium width dashed border.So though they are both valid you may need to keep an eye on your styles if they do much cascading and such like I think.(note: this answer has been updated on 2014-08-01 to make it more detailed, more accurate, and to add a live demo)According to W3C CSS2.1 specification (「Omitted values are set to their initial values」), the following properties are equivalent:If these rules are the most specific ones applied to the borders of an element, then the borders won't be shown, either because of zero-width, or because of hidden/none style. So, at the first look, these three rules look equivalent. However, they behave in different ways when combined with other rules.When a table is rendered using border-collapse: collapse, then each rendered border is shared between multiple elements (inner borders are shared among as neighbor cells; outer borders are shared between cells and the table itself; but also rows, row groups, columns and column groups share borders). The specification defines some rules for border conflict resolution:So, in a table context, border: hidden (or border-style: hidden) will have the highest priority and will make the shared border hidden, no matter what.On the other end of the priorities, border: none (or border-style: none) have the lowest priority, followed by the zero-width border (because it is the narrowest border). This means that a computed value of border-style: none and a computed value of border-width: 0 are essentially the same.Since none and 0 affect different properties (border-style and border-width), they will behave differently when a more specific rule defines just the style or just the width. See Chris answer for an example.Want to see all these cases in one single page? Open the live demo!Using doesn't work in some versions of IE.

IE9 is fine but in previous versions it displays the border even when the style is "none".

I experienced this when using a print stylesheet where I didn't want borders on the input boxes.seems to work fine in all browsers.You may simply use both as per the specification kindly provided by Oli.I always use border:0 none;.Though there is no harm in specifying them seperately and some browsers will parse the CSS faster if you do use the legacy CSS1 property calls.Though border:0; will normally default the border style to none, I have however noticed some browsers enforcing their default border style which can strangely overwrite border:0;.I use:From 8.5.4 in CSS 2.1:So either of your methods look fine.Well, to precisely see the difference between border: 0 and border: none we can make some experiments.Lets create three divs, first one whose border can only be disabled by setting its width to zero, second one that can only be disabled by setting its style to none, and a third with a border that can only be "disabled" by setting its color to transparent. Then lets try the effect of:My results were the same in both firefox and chrome:border: 0; Seems to set border-width to 0 and border-style to none, but not change border-color;border: none; Seems to only change border-style (to none);border: transparent; Seems to change border-color to transparent and border-style to none;While results will most likely be the same (no border), the 0 and none are technically addressing different things.0 addresses border width and none addresses border style. Obviously a border of 0 width is nonexistent so will therefore have no style.However, if later on in your stylesheet you intend to override this, you would naturally specifically address one or the other. If I now wanted a 3px border, that would be directly overriding border: 0 in regards to width. If I now wanted a dotted border, that would be directly overriding border: none in regards to styling.Easiest Way to remove border with cssWE SHOULD USE BORDER 0According to my opinion and experience, I would suggest please use Border: 0;

There is a valid and very good reason because whenever we use border: none, I understand it works but think about we are using a border, 1px, 2px, 3px etc. I mean we are giving the value our border is ...px/em/rem right so we need to use border: 0; for removing the border value because as we know when we use background: none; it means we are removing the background some background that is not a value that is something else.ThanksIn my point,border:none is working but not valid w3c standard so better we can use border:0;

Expand a div to fill the remaining width

[Expand a div to fill the remaining width](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1260122/expand-a-div-to-fill-the-remaining-width)

I want a two-column div layout, where each one can have variable width e.g.I want the 'view' div to expand to the whole width available after 'tree' div has filled needed space.Currently, my 'view' div is resized to content it contains

I want a two-column div layout, where each one can have variable width e.g.I want the 'view' div to expand to the whole width available after 'tree' div has filled needed space.Currently, my 'view' div is resized to content it contains

It will also be good if both divs take up the whole height.Not duplicate disclaimer:The solution to this is actually very easy, but not at all obvious.  You have to trigger something called a "block formatting context" (BFC), which interacts with floats in a specific way.Just take that second div, remove the float, and give it overflow:hidden instead.  Any overflow value other than visible makes the block it's set on become a BFC.  BFCs don't allow descendant floats to escape them, nor do they allow sibling/ancestor floats to intrude into them.  The net effect here is that the floated div will do its thing, then the second div will be an ordinary block, taking up all available width except that occupied by the float.This should work across all current browsers, though you may have to trigger hasLayout in IE6 and 7.  I can't recall.Demos:I just discovered the magic of flex boxes (display: flex). Try this:Flex boxes give me the control I've wished css had for 15 years. Its finally here! More info: https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/This would be a good example of something that's trivial to do with tables and hard (if not impossible, at least in a cross-browser sense) to do with CSS.If both the columns were fixed width, this would be easy.If one of the columns was fixed width, this would be slightly harder but entirely doable.With both columns variable width, IMHO you need to just use a two-column table.Check this solution outThis is what the flex-grow property is for.

Note: Add flex vendor prefixes if required by your supported browsers.Use calc:The problem with this is that all widths must be explicitly defined, either as a value(px and em work fine), or as a percent of something explicitly defined itself.Here, this might help...I don't understand why people are willing to work so hard to find a pure-CSS solution for simple columnar layouts that are SO EASY using the old TABLE tag.All Browsers still have the table layout logic... Call me a dinosaur perhaps, but I say let it help you.Much less risky in terms of cross-browser compatibility too.If the width of the other column is fixed, how about using the calc CSS function working for all common browsers:This way the width of the second row will be calculated (i.e. remaining width) and applied responsively. You can try CSS Grid Layout.flex-grow - This defines the ability for a flex item to grow if necessary. It accepts a unitless value that serves as a proportion. It dictates what amount of the available space inside the flex container the item should take up.If all items have flex-grow set to 1, the remaining space in the container will be distributed equally to all children. If one of the children has a value of 2, the remaining space would take up twice as much space as the others (or it will try to, at least).

I would recommend Simpl or, the slightly more complex, Blueprint framework.If you are using Simpl (which involves importing just one simpl.css file), you can do this:, for a 50-50 layout, or :, for a 25-75 one.It's that simple.I wrote a javascript function that I call from jQuery $(document).ready(). This will parse all children of the parent div and only update the right most child.htmljavascriptThis is fairly easy using flexbox. See the snippet below. I've added a wrapper container to control flow and set a global height. Borders have been added as well to identify the elements. Notice that divs now expand to the full height as well, as required.

The same would work for a header element, just set top:0 instead.For example:CSS:I believe the correct answer is that HTML 5 and CSS3 have no support for printing page header and footers in print media.And while you might be able to simulate it with: they each have bugs that prevent them from being the ideal general solution.I just spent the better half of my day coming up with a solution that actually worked for me and thought I would share what I did. The problem with the solutions above that I was having was that all of my paragraph elements would overlap with the footer I wanted at the bottom of the page. In order to get around this, I used the following CSS:The page-break-inside for p and content-block was crucial for me. Any time I have a p following an h*, I wrap them both in a div class = "content-block"> to ensure they stay together and don't break. I'm hoping that someone finds this useful because it took me about 3 hours to figure out (I'm also new to CSS/HTML, so there's that...)Per a request in the comments, I am adding an example HTML document. You'll want to copy this into an HTML file, open it, and then choose to print the page. The print preview should show this working. It worked in Firefox and IE on my end, but Chrome made the font small enough to fit on one page, so it didn't work there. I have been searching for years for a solution and found this post on how to print a footer that works on multiple pages without overlapping page content.My requirement was IE8, so far I have found that this does not work in Chrome. [update]As of 1 March 2018, it works in Chrome as wellThis example uses tables and the tfoot element by setting the css style: From this question -- add the following styles to a print-only stylesheet. This solution will work in IE and Firefox, but not in Chrome (as of version 21):Use page breaks to define the styles in CSS:Then add the markup in the document at the appropriate places:Referencesthe magic solution is really putting every thing in single table.and make a single tr, td and put every thing in a divCODE::which results in overflow that will make things overlap with the header within the page breaks..so >> use: page-break-inside: avoid !important; with this class article.pretty simple, hope this will give you the best result you wishing for.best regards. ;)I tried to fight this futile battle combining tfoot & css rules but it only worked on Firefox :(. When using plain css, the content flows over the footer. When using tfoot, the footer on the last page does not stay nicely on the bottom. This is because table footers are meant for tables, not physical pages. Tested on Chrome 16, Opera 11, Firefox 3 & 6 and IE6.One approach that only works for adding headers to every page is to wrap your content in a <table> and then put your header content in a <thead> tag and your content in a <tbody> tag, like so:This works in Chrome, not 100% sure about other browsers.If you can use javascipt, have the client handle laying out the content using javascript to place elements based on available space.You could use the jquery columnizer plugin to dynamically lay out your content in fixed size blocks and position your headers and footers as part of the rendering routine.

http://welcome.totheinter.net/columnizer-jquery-plugin/See example 10

http://welcome.totheinter.net/autocolumn/sample10.htmlThe browser will still add its own headers or footers if enabled in the os. Consistent layout across platforms and browsers will likely require conditional css.Is this something you want to print-only? You could add it to every page on your site and use CSS to define the tag as a print-only media.As an example, this could be an example header:And in your CSS, do something like this:Finally, to include the header/footer on every page you might use server-side includes or if you have any pages being generated with PHP or ASP you could simply code it in to a common file.Edit:This answer is intended to provide a way to show something on the physical printed version of a document while not showing it otherwise. However just as comments suggest, it doesn't solve the issue of having a footer on multiple printed pages when content overflows.I'm leaving it here in case it's helpful nevertheless.I'm surprised and unimpressed that Chrome has such terrible CSS print support.My task required showing a slightly different footer on each page. In the simplest case, just an incrementing chapter and page number. In more complex cases, more text in the footer - for example, several footnotes - which could expand it in size, causing what is on that page's content area to be shrunk and part of it to reflow to the next page.CSS print cannot solve this, at least not with shoddy browser support today. But stepping outside of print, CSS3 can do a lot of the heavy lifting:https://jsfiddle.net/b9chris/moctxd2a/29/SCSS:There's a little more code in the example, including some Cat Ipsum; but the js in use is just there to demonstrate how much the header/footer can vary without breaking pagination. The key really is to take a column-bottom-sticking trick from CSS Flexbox and then apply it to a page of a known, fixed height - in this case, an 8.5"x11" piece of US letter-sized paper, with .5" margins leaving width: 7.5in and height: 10in exactly. Once the CSS flex container is told its exact dimensions (div.page), it's easy to get the header and footer to expand and contract the way they do in conventional typography.What's left is flowing the content of the page when the footer, for example, grows to 8 footnotes not 3. In my case the content is fixed enough that I don't need to worry about it, but I'm sure there's a way to do it. One approach that leaps to mind, is to turn the header and footer into 100% width floats, then position them with Javascript. The browser will handle the interruptions to regular content flow for you automatically.If you are using a template engine like Asp.net Razor Engine or Angular, 

I think you must re-generate your page and split the page in several pages and then you can freely markup each page and put header and footer on theme.

 one example could be as bellow:I found one solution. The basic idea is to make a table and in thead section place the data of header in tr and by css force to show that tr only in print not in screen then your normal header should be force to show only in screen not in print. 100% working on many pages print. sample code is hereTry this, for me it's working on Chrome, Firefox and Safari. You will get header and footer fixed to each page without overlapping the page contentCSSHTMLBased on some post, i think position: fixed works for me.Press Ctrl+P in chrome see the header & footer text on each page.

to not support ::marker and I doubt that either Safari or Opera has it.

IE, of course, does not support it.So right now, the only way to do this is to use an image with list-style-image.I guess you could wrap the contents of an li with a span and then you could set the color of each, but that seems a little hackish to me.One way to do it is using li:before with content: "" and styling it as inline-block element.Here is a working code snippet:Yet, another solution is to use a :before pseudo element with a border-radius: 50%.

The list-style-image attribute is flakey in cross-browser environments, and adding an extra element, such as a span, is unneccessary.  So your code would end up looking something like this:The easiest thing you can do is wrap the contents of the <li> in a <span> or equivalent then you can set the color independently.Alternatively, you could make an image with the bullet color you want and set it with the list-style-image property.A variation of Lea Verou solution with perfect indentation in multi-line entries could be something like this:I am adding my solution to this problem.I don't want to use image and validator will punish you for using negative values in CSS, so I go this way:I know it's a bit of a late answer for this post, but for reference...CSSThe bullet colour is defined on the ul tag and then we switch the li colour back.Taking Lea's demo, here's a different way of making unordered lists, with borders: http://jsfiddle.net/vX4K8/7/HTMLCSSLea Verous solution is good but i wanted more control over the position of the bullets so this is my approach:This will do it..

I have a div in my HTML page. I am showing this div based on some condition, but the div is displaying behind the HTML element where I pointed the mouse cursor.I have tried all values for z-index from 0 - 999999. Can anyone tell me why this is happening?Is there any minimum or maximum value of Z-INDEX property of CSS?I am showing and hiding the div with .divClass onclick via the <asp:hyperlink> using jQuery.http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/visuren.html#z-indexhttp://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/syndata.html#numbersSo basically there are no limitations for z-index value in the CSS standard, but I guess most browsers limit it to signed 32-bit values (−2147483648 to +2147483647) in practice (64 would be a little off the top, and it doesn't make sense to use anything less than 32 bits these days)My tests show that z-index: 2147483647 is the maximum value, tested on FF 3.0.1 for OS X.

I discovered a integer overflow bug: if you type z-index: 2147483648 (which is 2147483647 + 1) the element just goes behind all other elements. At least the browser doesn't crash.And the lesson to learn is that you should beware of entering too large values for the z-index property because they wrap around.The minimum value of Z-index is 0;  the maximum value depends on browser type. It depends on the browser (although the latest version of all browsers should max out at 2147483638), as does the browser's reaction when the maximum is exceeded.http://www.puidokas.com/max-z-index/It's the maximum value of a 32 bits integer: 2147483647Also see the docs: https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS22/visuren.html#z-index

(Negative numbers are allowed)Out of experience, I think the correct maximum z-index is 2147483638. [Edited to correct the value which is slightly higher].Z-Index only works for elements that have position: relative; or position: absolute; applied to them. If that's not the problem we'll need to see an example page to be more helpful.EDIT: The good doctor has already put the fullest explanation but the quick version is that the minimum is 0 because it can't be a negative number and the maximum - well, you'll never really need to go above 10 for most designs.I have found that often if z-index isn't working its because its parent/siblings don't have a specified z-index.  So if you have:item #3, or even #4, may be contesting #2 for the click/hover space, though if you set #1 to z-index 0, the siblings who's z-index put them in independant stacks now are in the same stack and will z-index properly.This has a helpful and fairly humanized description: http://foohack.com/2007/10/top-5-css-mistakes/

 A user above says "well, you'll never really need to go above 10 for most designs." Depending on your project, you may only need z-indexes 0-1, or z-indexes 0-10000. You'll often need to play in the higher digits...especially if you are working with lightbox viewers (9999 seems to be the standard and if you want to top their z-index, you'll need to exceed that!)While INT_MAX is probably the safest bet, WebKit apparently uses doubles internally and thus allows very large numbers (to a certain precision). LLONG_MAX e.g. works fine (at least in 64-Bit Chromium and WebkitGTK), but will be rounded to 9223372036854776000.(Although you should consider carefully whether you really, really need this many z indices…).

Is there a way to add some custom font on a website without using images, Flash or some other graphics?For example, I was working on a wedding website, and I found a lot of nice fonts for that subject. But I can't find the right way to add that font on the server. And how do I include that font with CSS into the HTML? Is this possible to do without graphics?This could be done via CSS:It is supported for all of the regular browsers if you use TrueType-Fonts (TTF) or the Web Open Font Format (WOFF).You can add some fonts via Google Web Fonts.Technically, the fonts are hosted at Google and you link them in the HTML header. Then, you can use them freely in CSS with @font-face (read about it).For example:In the <head> section:Then in CSS:The solution seems quite reliable (even Smashing Magazine uses it for an article title.). There are, however, not so many fonts available so far in Google Font Directory.The way to go is using the @font-face CSS declaration which allows authors to specify online fonts to display text on their web pages. By allowing authors to provide their own fonts, @font-face eliminates the need to depend on the limited number of fonts users have installed on their computers.Take a look at the following table: As you can see, there are several formats that you need to know about mainly due to cross-browser compatibility. The scenario in mobile devices isn't much different.1 - Full browser compatibilityThis is the method with the deepest support possible right now:2 - Most of the browserThings are shifting heavily toward WOFF though, so you can probably get away with:3 - Only the latest browsersOr even just WOFF.

You then use it like this:That's mainly what you need to know about implementing this feature. If you want to research more on the subject I'll encourage to take a look at the following resources. Most of what I put here is extracted from the followingIf by non standard font, you mean custom font of a standard format, here's how I do it, and it works for all browsers I've checked so far:so you'll just need both the ttf and eot fonts. Some tools available online can make the conversion.But if you want to attach font in a non standard format (bitmaps etc), I can't help you.I've found that the easiest way to have non-standard fonts on a website is to use sIFRIt does involve the use of a Flash object that contains the font, but it degrades nicely to standard text / font if Flash is not installed.The style is set in your CSS, and JavaScript sets up the Flash replacement for your text.Edit: (I still recommend using images for non-standard fonts as sIFR adds time to a project and can require maintenance).The article Font-face in IE: Making Web Fonts Work says it works with all three major browsers.Here is a sample I got working: http://brendanjerwin.com/test_font.htmlMore discussion is in Embedding Fonts.Typeface.js and Cufon are two other interesting options. They are JavaScript components that render special font data in JSON format (which you can convert from TrueType or OpenType formats on their web sites) via the new <canvas> element in all newer browsers except Internet Explorer and via VML in Internet Explorer.The main problem with both (as of now) is that selecting text does not work or at least works only quite awkwardly.Still, it is very nice for headlines. Body text... I don't know.And it's surprisingly fast.Or you could try sIFR. I know it uses Flash, but only if available. If Flash isn't available, it displays the original text in its original (CSS) font.The technique that the W3C has recommended for do this is called "embedding" and is well described by the three articles here: Embedding Fonts.  In my limited experiments, I have found this process error-prone and have had limited success in making it function in a multi-browser environment.Safari and Internet Explorer both support the CSS @font-face rule, however they support two different embedded font types. Firefox is planning to support the same type as Apple some time soon. SVG can embed fonts but isn't that widely supported yet (without a plugin).I think the most portable solution I've seen is to use a JavaScript function to replace headings etc. with an image generated and cached on the server with your font of choice -- that way you simply update the text and don't have to stuff around in Photoshop.If you use ASP.NET, it's really easy to generate image based fonts without actually having to install (as in adding to the installed font base) fonts on the server by using:and then drawing with that font onto a Graphics.It looks like it only works in Internet Explorer, but a quick Google search for "html embed fonts" yields http://www.spoono.com/html/tutorials/tutorial.php?id=19If you want to stay platform-agnostic (and you should!) you'll have to use images, or else just use a standard font.I did a bit of research and dug up Dynamic Text Replacement (published 2004-06-15).This technique uses images, but it appears to be "hands free". You write your text, and you let a few automated scripts do automated find-and-replace on the page for you on the fly. It has some limitations, but it is probably one of the easier choices (and more browser compatible) than all the rest I've seen.It is also possible to use WOFF fonts - example hereJust simply provide the link to actual font like this and you will be good to goTypeface.js JavaScript Way:http://typeface.neocracy.org/See the article 50 Useful Design Tools For Beautiful Web Typography for alternative methods.I have only used Cufon. I have found it reliable and very easy to use, so I've stuck with it.If you have a file of your font, then you will need to add more formats of that font for other browsers. For this purpose I use font generator like Fontsquirrel it provides all the font formats & its @font-face CSS, you will only need to just drag & drop it into your CSS file.

Center image using text-align center?

[Center image using text-align center?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7055393/center-image-using-text-align-center)

Is the property text-align: center; a good way to center an image using CSS?

2011-08-14 06:21:52Z

Is the property text-align: center; a good way to center an image using CSS?That will not work as the text-align property applies to block containers, not inline elements, and img is an inline element. See the W3C specification.Use this instead:That doesn't always work... if it doesn't, try:I came across this post, and it worked for me:(Vertical and horizontal alignment)Another way of doing it would be centering an enclosing paragraph:You can do:<center><img src="..." /></center>Actually, the only problem with your code is that the text-align attribute applies to text (yes, images count as text) inside of the tag.  You would want to put a span tag around the image and set its style to text-align: center, as so:  The image will be centered.  In response to your question, it is the easiest and most foolproof way to center images, as long as you remember to apply the rule to the image's containing span (or div).  There are three methods for centering an element that I can suggest:The first and second methods only work if the parent is at least as wide as the image. When the image is wider than its parent, the image will not stay centered!!!But:

The third method is a good way for that!Here's an example:Only if you need to support ancient versions of Internet Explorer.The modern approach is to do margin: 0 auto in your CSS.Example here: http://jsfiddle.net/bKRMY/HTML:CSS:The only issue here is that the width of the paragraph must be the same as the width of the image. If you don't put a width on the paragraph, it will not work, because it will assume 100% and your image will be aligned left, unless of course you use text-align:center.Try out the fiddle and experiment with it if you like.If you are using a class with an image then the following will doIf it is only an image in a specific class that you want to center align then following will do:On the container holding image you can use a CSS 3 Flexbox to perfectly center the image inside, both vertically and horizontally.Let's assume you have <div class="container"> as the image holder:Then as CSS you have to use:And this will make all your content inside this div perfectly centered.Simply change parent align :)Try this one on parent properties:You can use text-align: center on the parent and change the img to display: inline-block → it therefore behaves like a text-element and is will be centered if the parent has a width!The simplest solution I found was to add this to my img-element:It seems I don't need to add "0" before the "auto" as suggested by others. Maybe that is the proper way, but it works well enough for my purposes without the "0" as well. At least on latest Firefox, Chrome, and Edge.I would use a div to center align an image. As in:If you want to set the image as the background, I've got a solution:To center a non background image depends on whether you want to display the image as an inline (default behavior) or a block element.Case of inlineIf you want to keep the default behavior of the image's display CSS property, you will need to wrap your image inside another block element to which you must set text-align: center;Case of blockIf you want to consider the image as a block element of its own, then text-align property does not make a sens, and you should do this instead:The answer to your question:Yes and no.ReferencesOne more way to scale - display it:Use this to your img CSS:display: block with margin: 0 didn't work for me, neither wrapping with a text-align: center element.This is my solution:translateX is supported by most browsersI discovered that if I have an image and some text inside a div, then I can use text-align:center to align the text and the image in one swoop.HTML:CSS:CodePen:

When we insert the images inside the content and want to align that center.

I am looking for a CSS selector for the following table:Is there any selector to match all TDs containing "male"?

2009-10-05 14:26:09Z

I am looking for a CSS selector for the following table:Is there any selector to match all TDs containing "male"?If I read the specification correctly, no.  You can match on an element, the name of an attribute in the element, and the value of a named attribute in an element.  I don't see anything for matching content within an element, though.Using jQuery: Looks like they were thinking about it for the CSS3 spec but it didn't make the cut.:contains() CSS3 selector http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-selectors/#content-selectorsYou'd have to add a data attribute to the rows called data-gender with a male or female value and use the attribute selector:HTML:CSS:There is actually a very conceptual basis for why this hasn't been implemented.  It is a combination of basically 3 aspects:These 3 together mean that by the time you have the text content you cannot ascend back to the containing element, and you cannot style the present text.  This is likely significant as descending only allows for a singular tracking of context and SAX style parsing. Ascending or other selectors involving other axes introduce the need for more complex traversal or similar solutions that would greatly complicate the application of CSS to the DOM.You could set content as data attribute and then use attribute selectors, as shown here:You can also use jQuery to easily set the data-content attributes:As CSS lacks this feature you will have to use JavaScript to style cells by content. For example with XPath's contains:Then use the result like so:https://jsfiddle.net/gaby_de_wilde/o7bka7Ls/9/I'm afraid this is not possible, because the content is no attribute nor is it accessible via a pseudo class. The full list of CSS3 selectors can be found in the CSS3 specification.For those who are looking to do Selenium CSS text selections, this script might be of some use.The trick is to select the parent of the element that you are looking for, and then search for the child that has the text: This will return the first element if there is more than one since it's always one element, in my case.I agree the data attribute (voyager's answer) is how it should be handled, BUT, CSS rules like: can often be much easier to set up, especially with client-side libs like angularjs which could be as simple as:Just make sure that the content is only one word! Or you could even map to different CSS class names with:For completeness, here's the data attribute approach:@voyager's answer about using data-* attribute (e.g. data-gender="female|male" is the most effective and standards compliant approach as of 2017:Pretty much most goals can be attained as there are some albeit limited selectors oriented around text. The ::first-letter is a pseudo-element that can apply limited styling to the first letter of an element. There is also a ::first-line pseudo-element besides obviously selecting the first line of an element (such as a paragraph) also implies that it is obvious that CSS could be used to extend this existing capability to style specific aspects of a textNode.Until such advocacy succeeds and is implemented the next best thing I could suggest when applicable is to explode/split words using a space deliminator, output each individual word inside of a span element and then if the word/styling goal is predictable use in combination with :nth selectors:Else if not predictable to, again, use voyager's answer about using data-* attribute. An example using PHP:Most of the answers here try to offer alternative to how to write the HTML code to include more data because at least up to CSS3 you cannot select an element by partial inner text. But it can be done, you just need to add a bit of vanilla JavaScript, notice since female also contains male it will be selected:If you're using Chimp / Webdriver.io, they support a lot more CSS selectors than the CSS spec. This, for example, will click on the first anchor that contains the words "Bad bear":You could also use content with attr() and style table cells that are :not :empty:A ZeroWidthSpace is used to change the color and may be added using vanilla JavaScript:Although the <td>s end tag may be omitted doing so may cause it to be treated as non-empty.If you don't create the DOM yourself (e.g. in a userscript) you can do the following with pure JS:Console outputDoing small Filter Widgets like this: The syntax of this question looks like Robot Framework syntax.

In this case, although there is no css selector that you can use for contains, there is a SeleniumLibrary keyword that you can use instead.

Possible paths like: According to W3:Therefore, in answer to your question, it will be relative to /stylesheets/.If you think about this, this makes sense, since the CSS file could be added to pages in different directories, so standardising it to the CSS file means that the URLs will work wherever the stylesheets are linked.It's relative to the CSS file.It's relative to the stylesheet, but I'd recommend making the URLs relative to your URL:That way, you can move your files around without needing to refactor them in the future.Taken from the CSS 2.1 spec.For CSS style sheets, the base URI is that of the style sheet, not that of the source document. (Anything else would be broken, IMNSHO)One issue that can occur, and seemingly break this is when using auto minimization of css. The request path for the minified bundle can have a different path than the original css. This may happen automatically so it can cause confusion.The mapped request path for the minified bundle should be "/originalcssfolder/minifiedbundlename" not just "minifiedbundlename".In other words, name your bundles to have same path (with the /) as the original folder structure, this way any external resources like fonts, images will map to correct URIs by the browser. The alternative is to use absolute url( refs in your css but that isn't usually desirable.This worked for me. adding two dots and slash.Try using:Images being folder holding the picture that you want to post.

Is there any way to force my stylesheets and if possible, completely overwrite Chrome's default stylesheet?What are the target browsers? Different browsers set different default CSS rules. Try including a CSS reset, such as the meyerweb css reset or normalize.css, to remove those defaults. Google "css reset vs normalize" to see the differences.If <!DOCTYPE> is missing in your html you may experience that the browser gives preference to the "user agent stylesheet" over your custom stylesheet. Adding the doctype fixes this.Regarding the concept「user agent style sheet」, consult section Cascade in the CSS 2.1 spec.User agent style sheets are overridden by anything that you set in your own style sheet. They are just the rock bottom: in the absence of any style sheets provided by the page or by the user, the browser still has to render the content somehow, and the user agent style sheet just describes this.So if you think you have a problem with a user agent style sheet, then you really have a problem with your markup, or your style sheet, or both (about which you wrote nothing).Marking the document as HTML5 by the proper doctype on the first line, solved my issue.A user agent style sheet is a 」default style sheet」provided by the browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Edge, etc.) in order to present the page in a way that satisfies 」general presentation expectations.」For example, a default style sheet would provide base styles for things like font size, borders, and spacing between elements. It is common to employ a reset style sheet to deal with inconsistencies amongst browsers. From the spec...For more information about user agents in general...https://www.w3.org/TR/UAAG20/#def-user-agentDefine the values that you don't want to be used from Chrome's user agent style in your own CSS.Answering the question in title, what is the user agent stylesheet, the set of default styles in the browser, here are some of them (and most relevant ones also in today's web):Personal opinion, don't fight with them, they have good default values, for example in rtl/bidi cases, and are consistent nowadays, reset what you see irrelevant to you, not all of them at once.Some browsers use their own way to read .css files.

So the right way to beat this:

If you type the command line directly in the .html source code, this beats the .css file, in that way, you told the browser directly what to do and the browser is at position not to read the commands from the .css file.

Remember that the commands writen in the .html file is stronger than the command in the .css.I had the same problem as one of my  was have margin set by the browser, it was quite annoying but then i figured out as most of the people said, its a mark up error.I went back and checked my  section and my css link was like below:<link rel="stylesheet" href="ex.css">i included type in it and made it like below:<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="ex.css">my problem was solved. Hope it helps for some of u.Each browser provides a default stylesheet, called the user agent stylesheet, in case an HTML file does not specify one. Styles that you specify override the defaults. Because you have not specified values for the table element’s box, the default styles have been appliedI have a solution check this:-ErrorCorrect put the following code in your CSS file

In short, if you really need the effect, consider JS libraries (most of them should be able to run on IE6) but don't over do it due to performance issues; if you still need an alternative... you could use SFiR, then PS it and SFiR it.

Can I compress all plugins together or should it be its own separate file?The Google AJAX Libraries API, which includes jQuery UI (currently v1.10.3), also includes popular themes as per the jQuery UI blog:Google Ajax Libraries API (CDN)jQuery now has a CDN access:code.jquery.com/ui/[version]/themes/[theme name]/jquery-ui.cssAnd to make this  a little more easy, Here you go:Google is hosting jQueryUI css at this link https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jqueryui/1.8/themes/base/jquery.ui.all.cssIf you look at this code directly, it is importing the css using @import which can be slow. You may want to factor the import into its parts to gain a slight performance benefit:https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jqueryui/1.8/themes/base/jquery.ui.base.css

https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jqueryui/1.8/themes/base/jquery.ui.theme.cssI would think so. Why not? Wouldn't be much of a CDN w/o offering the CSS to support the script filesThis link suggests that they are:You could use this one if you mean the jQuery UI css:As Obama says "Yes We Can".

When I use class for table than this apply on tr alternative.Can I write my HTML like this using CSS?How can I make the rows have "zebra stripes" using CSS?There is a CSS selector, really a pseudo-selector, called nth-child. In pure CSS you can do the following:Note: No support in IE 8.Or, if you have jQuery:You have the :nth-child() pseudo-class:In the early days of :nth-child() its browser support was kind of poor. That's why setting class="odd" became such a common technique. In late 2013 I'm glad to say that IE6 and IE7 are finally dead (or sick enough to stop caring) but IE8 is still around — thankfully, it's the only exception.Just add the following to your html code (withing the <head>) and you are done.HTML:Easier and faster than jQuery examples.Yes you can but then you will have to use the :nth-child() pseudo selector (which has limited support though):We can use odd and even CSS rules and jQuery method for alternate row colorsUsing CSSUsing jQueryMost of the above codes won't work with IE version. The solution that works for IE+ other browsers is this. You can use nth-child(odd/even) selectors however not all browsers (ie 6-8, ff v3.0) support these rules hence why most solutions fall back to some form of javascript/jquery solution to add the classes to the rows for these non compliant browsers to get the tiger stripe effect.There is a fairly easy way to do this in PHP, if I understand your query, I assume that you code in PHP and you are using CSS and javascript to enhance the output.The dynamic output from the database will carry a for loop to iterate through results which are then loaded into the table. Just add a function call to the  like this: then add the function to the page or library file:}Now this will alternate dynamically between colors at each newly generated table row.It's a lot easier than messing about with CSS that doesn't work on all browsers.Hope this helps.

I have been doing some research on media queries and I still don't quite understand how to target devices of certain sizes. I want to be able to target desktop, tablet and mobile. I know that there will be some discrepancies but it would be nice to have a generic system that can be used to target these devices. Some examples I have found:Or:What do you think these 'breakpoints' should be for each device?IMO these are the best breakpoints:Edit: Refined to work better with 960 grids:In practice, many designers convert pixels to ems, largely b/c ems better afford zooming. At standard zoom 1em === 16px. Multiply pixels by 1em/16px to get ems. For example, 320px === 20em.In response to the comment, min-width is standard in "mobile-first" design, wherein you start by designing for your smallest screens, and then add ever-increasing media queries, working you way onto larger and larger screens. Regardless of whether you prefer min-, max-, or combinations thereof, be cognizant of the order of your rules, keeping in mind that if multiple rules match the same element, the later rules will override the earlier rules.If you want to target a device then just write min-device-width. For example:Here are some good articles:The general wisdom is not to target specific devices or sizes, but to reframe the term 'breakpoint':You can use responsivepx.com to find the 'natural' breakpoints, as in 'breakpoints are dead' by Marc Drummond.The 'breakpoints' then become the actual point at which your mobile design begins to 'break' i.e. cease to be usable or visually pleasing. Once you have a good working mobile site, without media queries, you can stop being concerned about specific sizes and simply add media queries that handle successively larger viewports.If you're not trying to pin a design to an exact screen size, this approach works by removing the need to target specific devices. The integrity of the design itself at each breakpoint ensures that it will hold up at any size. In other words, if a menu/content section/whatever stops being usable at a certain size, design a breakpoint for that size, not for a specific device size.See Lyza Gardner's post on behavioural breakpoints, and also Zeldman's post about Ethan Marcotte and how responsive web design evolved from the intitial idea.Further, the simpler and more semantic the DOM structure with nav, header, main, section, footer etc. (avoiding abominations like div class="header" with nested inner div tags) the easier it will be to engineer responsiveness, especially avoiding floats by using CSS Grid Layout (Sarah Drasner's grid generator is a great tool for this) and flexbox for arranging and re-ordering according to your RWD design plan.The best breakpoints recommended by Twitter BootstrapIt's not a matter of pixels count, it's a matter of actual size (in mm or inches) of characters on the screen, which depends on pixels density.

Hence "min-width:" and "max-width:" are useless.

A full explanation of this issue is here:

what exactly is device pixel ratio?"@media" queries take into account the pixels count and the device pixel ratio, resulting in a "virtual resolution" which is what you have to actually take into account while designing your page: if your font is 10px fixed-width and the "virtual horizontal resolution" is 300 px, 30 characters will be needed to fill a line.Since there are many varying screen sizes that always change and most likely will always change the best way to go is to base your break points and media queries on your design.The easiest way to go about this is to grab your completed desktop design and open it in your web browser. Shrink the screen slowly to make it narrower. Observe to see when the design starts to, "break", or looks horrible and cramped. At this point a break point with a media query would be required.It's common to create three sets of media queries for desktop, tablet and phone. But if your design looks good on all three, why bother with the complexity of adding three different media queries that are not necessary. Do it on an as-needed basis!Nowadays the most common thing is to see retina-screen devices, in other words: devices with high resolutions and a very high pixel density (but usually smaller than 6 inches physical size). That's why you will need retina display specialized media-queries on your CSS. This is the most complete example I could find:Source: CSS-Tricks WebsiteThe behavior does not change on desktop. But on tablets and mobiles, I expand the navbar to cover the big logo image. Note: Use the margin (top and bottom) as much as you need for your logo height. For my case, 60px top and bottom worked perfectly! Check the navbar here.One extra feature is you can also use-media queries in the media attribute of the <link> tag.With this, the browser will download all CSS resources, regardless of the media attribute.

The difference is that if the media-query of the media attribute is evaluated to false then that .css file and his content will not be render-blocking.Therefore, it is recommended to use the media attribute in the <link> tag since it guarantees a better user experience.Here you can read a Google article about this issue https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/performance/critical-rendering-path/render-blocking-cssSome tools that will help you to automate the separation of your css code in different files according to your media-querysWebpack

Ie, I want to use absolute positioning with the two child divs, but position them relative to the parent div rather than the page. How can I do this? Sample html:This works because position: absolute means something like "use top, right, bottom, left to position yourself in relation to the nearest ancestor who has position: absolute or position: relative."So we make #father have position: relative, and the children have position: absolute, then use top and bottom to position the children.Incase someone wants to postion a child div directly under a parentWorking demo CodepenIf you don't give any position to parent then by default it takes static.

2014-06-12 03:27:17Z

I am confused with the grid system in the new Bootstrap, particularly these classes:(where * represents some number).Can anyone please explain the following:Applies to Bootstrap 3 only.Ignoring the letters (xs, sm, md, lg) for now, I'll start with just the numbers...So, if you want two equal columns to span a div, writeOr, if you want three unequal columns to span that same width, you could write:You'll notice the # of columns always add up to 12. It can be less than twelve, but beware if more than 12, as your offending divs will bump down to the next row (not .row, which is another story altogether).You can also nest columns within columns, (best with a .row wrapper around them) such as:Each set of nested divs also span up to 12 columns of their parent div. NOTE: Since each .col class has 15px padding on either side, you should usually wrap nested columns in a .row, which has -15px margins. This avoids duplicating the padding and keeps the content lined up between nested and non-nested col classes.-- You didn't specifically ask about the xs, sm, md, lg usage, but they go hand-in-hand so I can't help but touch on it... In short, they are used to define at which screen size that class should apply:You should usually classify a div using multiple column classes so it behaves differently depending on the screen size (this is the heart of what makes bootstrap responsive). eg: a div with classes col-xs-6 and col-sm-4 will span half the screen on the mobile phone (xs) and 1/3 of the screen on tablets(sm). NOTE: as per comment below, grid classes for a given screen size apply to that screen size and larger unless another declaration overrides it (i.e. col-xs-6 col-md-4 spans 6 columns on xs and sm, and 4 columns on md and lg, even though sm and lg were never explicitly declared)NOTE: if you don't define xs, it will default to col-xs-12 (i.e. col-sm-6 is half the width on sm, md and lg screens, but full-width on xs screens).NOTE: it's actually totally fine if your .row includes more than 12 cols, as long as you are aware of how they will react. --This is a contentious issue, and not everyone agrees.OK, the answer is easy, but read on:col-lg- stands for column large ≥ 1200px

col-md- stands for column medium ≥ 992px

col-xs- stands for column extra small ≥ 768pxThe pixel numbers are the breakpoints, so for example col-xs is targeting the element when the window is smaller than 768px(likely mobile devices)...I also created the image below to show how the grid system works, in this examples I use them with 3, like col-lg-6 to show you how the grid system work in the page, look at how lg, md and xs are responsive to the window size:The main point is this:col-lg-* col-md-* col-xs-* col-sm define how many columns will there be in these different screen sizes.Example: if you want there to be two columns in desktop screens and in phone screens you put two col-md-6 and two col-xs-6 classes in your columns.If you want there to be two columns in desktop screens and only one column in phone screens (ie two rows stacked on top of each other) you put two col-md-6 and two col-xs-12 in your columns and because sum will be 24 they will auto stack on top of each other, or just leave xs style out.From Twitter Bootstrap documentation:to Read More...Here you gocol-lg-2    :  if the screen is large (lg) then this component will take space of 2  elements considering entire row can fit 12 elements ( so you will see that on large screen this component takes 16% space of a row)col-lg-6    :  if the screen is large (lg) then this component will take space of 6  elements considering entire row can fit 12 elements -- when applied you will see that the component has taken half the available space in the row.Above rule is only applied when the screen is large. when the screen is small this rule is discarded and only one component per row is shown.Below image shows various screen size widths :

How to affect other elements when one element is hovered

What I want to do is when a certain div is hovered, it'd affect the properties of another div.For example, in this JSFiddle demo, when you hover over #cube it changes the background-color but what I want is that when I hover over #container, #cubeis affected.If the cube is directly inside the container:If cube is next to (after containers closing tag) the container:If the cube is somewhere inside the container:If the cube is a sibling of the container:In this particular example, you can use:This example only works since cube is a child of container. For more complicated scenarios, you'd need to use different CSS, or use JavaScript.Using the sibling selector is the general solution for styling other elements when hovering over a given one, but it works only if the other elements follow the given one in the DOM. What can we do when the other elements should actually be before the hovered one? Say we want to implement a signal bar rating widget like the one below:This can actually be done easily using the CSS flexbox model, by setting flex-direction to reverse, so that the elements are displayed in the opposite order from the one they're in the DOM. The screenshot above is from such a widget, implemented with pure CSS.Flexbox is very well supported by 95% of modern browsers.Big thanks to Mike and Robertc for their helpful posts!If you have two elements in your HTML and you want to :hover over one and target a style change in the other the two elements must be directly related--parents, children or siblings. This means that the two elements either must be one inside the other or must both be contained within the same larger element. I wanted to display definitions in a box on the right side of the browser as my users read through my site and :hover over highlighted terms; therefore, I did not want the 'definition' element to be displayed inside the 'text' element.I almost gave up and just added javascript to my page, but this is the future dang it! We should not have to put up with back sass from CSS and HTML telling us where we have to place our elements to achieve the effects we want! In the end we compromised.While the actual HTML elements in the file must be either nested or contained in a single element to be valid :hover targets to each other, the css position attribute can be used to display any element where ever you want. I used position:fixed to place the target of my :hover action where I wanted it on the user's screen regardless to its location in the HTML document.The html:The css:In this example the target of a :hover command from an element within #explainBox must either be #explainBox or also within #explainBox. The position attributes assigned to #definitions force it to appear in the desired location (outside #explainBox) even though it is technically located in an unwanted position within the HTML document.I understand it is considered bad form to use the same #id for more than one HTML element; however, in this case the instances of #light can be described independently due to their respective positions in uniquely #id'd elements. Is there any reason not to repeat the id #light in this case?Only this worked for me:Where .cube is CssClass of the #cube.Tested in Firefox, Chrome and Edge.Here is another idea that allow you to affect other elements without considering any specific selector and by only using the :hover state of the main element. For this, I will rely on the use of custom properties (CSS variables). As we can read in the specification:The idea is to define custom properties within the main element and use them to style child elements and since these properties are inherited we simply need to change them within the main element on hover.  Here is an example:Why this can be better than using specific selector combined with hover?I can provide at least 2 reasons that make this method a good one to consider:Here is a more complex example:As we can see above, we only need one CSS declaration in order to change many properties of different elements.

I have two divs side by side. I'd like the height of them to be the same, and stay the same if one of them resizes. I can't figure this one out though. Ideas?To clarify my confusing question, I'd like both boxes to always be the same size, so if one grows because text is placed into it, the other one should grow to match the height.With flexbox it's a single declaration:Prefixes may be required for older browsers, see browser support.This is a common problem which many have encountered, but luckily some smart minds like Ed Eliot's on his blog have posted their solutions online.Basically what you do is make both divs/columns very tall by adding a padding-bottom: 100% and then "trick the browser" into thinking they aren't that tall using margin-bottom: -100%. It is better explained by Ed Eliot on his blog, which also includes many examples.This is an area where CSS has never really had any solutions — you’re down to using <table> tags (or faking them using the CSS display:table* values), as that’s the only place where a「keep a bunch of elements the same height」was implemented.This works in all versions of Firefox, Chrome and Safari, Opera from at least version 8, and in IE from version 8.Using jQuery, you can do it in a super simple one-line-script.This is a bit more interesting. The technique is called Faux Columns.  More or less you don't actually set the actual height to be the same, but you rig up some graphical elements so they look the same height.I'm surprised that nobody has mentioned the (very old but reliable) Absolute Columns technique:

http://24ways.org/2008/absolute-columns/In my opinion, it is far superior to both Faux Columns and One True Layout's technique.The general idea is that an element with position: absolute; will position against the nearest parent element that has position: relative;. You then stretch a column to fill 100% height by assigning both a top: 0px; and bottom: 0px; (or whatever pixels/percentages you actually need.) Here's an example:You can use Jquery's Equal Heights Plugin to accomplish, this plugins makes all the div of exact same height as other. If one of them grows and other will also grow.Here a sample of implementationHere is the linkhttp://www.cssnewbie.com/equalheights-jquery-plugin/ You could use Faux Columns. Basically it uses a background image in a containing DIV to simulate the two equal-height-DIVs. Using this technique also allowes you to add shadows, rounded corners, custom borders or other funky patterns to your containers.Only works with fixed-width boxes though.Well tested out and properly working in every browser.Just spotted this thread while searching for this very answer. I just made a small jQuery function, hope this helps, works like a charm:JAVASCRIPTHTMLThe modern way of doing this (which also avoids having to declare a <div class="row"></div>-wrapper around every two items) would be to make use of a CSS grid. This also gives you easy control on the gaps between your item rows/columns.This question was asked 6 years ago, but it's still worthy to give a simple answer with flexbox layout nowadays.Just add the following CSS to the father <div>, it will work.The first two lines declare it will be displayed as flexbox. And flex-direction: row tells browsers that its children will be display in columns. And align-items: stretch will meet the requirement that all the children elements will stretch to the same height it one of them become higher.If you don't mind one of the divs being a master and dictating the height for both divs there is this:FiddleNo matter what, the div on the right will expand or squish&overflow to match the height of the div on the left.Both divs must be immediate children of a container, and have to specify their widths within it.Relevant CSS:I like to use pseudo elements to achieve this. You can use it as background of the content and let them fill the space.With these approach you can set margins between columns, borders, etc.I have tried almost all the mentioned methods above, but the flexbox solution won't work correctly with Safari, and the grid layout methods won't work correctly with older versions of IE.This solution fits all screens and is cross-browser compatible:The above method will equal cells height, and for the smaller screens like mobile or tablet, we can use the @media method mentioned above.Say you have a container with two divs inside and you want those two divs to have the same height.You would set 'display: flex' on the container as well as 'align-items: stretch'Then just give the child divs a 'min-height' of 100%See the code belowyou can use jQuery to achieve this easily.CSSjQueryHTMLYou'll need to include jQueryI know its been a long time but I share my solution anyway.

This is a jQuery trick.--- HTML ---- CSS--- JQUERYThe FiddleHTMLCSSThis is a jQuery plugin which sets the equal height for all elements on the same row(by checking the element's offset.top). So if your jQuery array contains elements from more than one row(different offset.top), each row will have a separated height, based on element with maximum height on that row.};I was having the same problem so i created this small function using jquery as jquery is part of every web application nowadays.You can call this function on page ready eventI hope this works for you.I recently came across this and didn't really like the solutions so I tried experimenting..mydivclass {inline-block; vertical-align: middle; width: 33%;}What I did here is to change the height to min-height and gave it a fixed value. if one of them is getting resized the other one will stay the same height. not sure if this is what you want

Adding fixed to the background seems to fix that - no need for height: 100%;E.g.:Here's what I did to solve this problem... it will show the gradient for the full length of the content, then simply fallback to the background color (normally the last color in the gradient).I've tested this in FireFox 3.6, Safari 4, and Chrome, I keep the background-color in the body for any browsers that for some reason don't support styling the HTML tag.I know I'm late to the party, but here's a more solid answer.All you need to do is use min-height: 100%; rather than height: 100%; and your gradient background will extend the entire height of the viewport without repeating, even if the content is scrollable.Like this:Setting html { height: 100%} can wreak havoc with IE. Here's an example (png). But you know what works great? Just set your background on the <html> tag. Background extends to the bottom and no weird scrolling behavior occurs. You can skip all of the other fixes. And this is broadly supported. I haven't found a browser that doesn't let you apply a background to the html tag.

That or at least set a default background color that is the end gradient color as well.I had trouble getting the answers in here to work.

On specifc modals only?Bootstrap modal pageOn Options chapter, in the page you linked, you can see the backdrop option. Passing this option with value 'static' will prevent closing the modal.

As @PedroVagner pointed on comments, you also can pass {keyboard: false} to prevent closing the modal by pressing Esc.  If you opening the modal by js use:  If you are using data attributes, use:    This is the easiest oneYou can define your modal behavior, defining data-keyboard and data-backdrop.You can use an attribute like this: data-backdrop="static" or with javascript:  See this answer too: Disallow twitter bootstrap modal window from closingIn my application, I am using the below piece of code to show Bootstrap modal via jQuery.You can useto change the default behavior.There are two ways to disable click outside of bootstrap model area to close modal-Checkout This ::Another option if you do not know if the modal has already been opened or not yet and you need to configure the modal options:Change options to _configThe solution that work for me is the following: backdrop: disabled the click outside eventkeyboard: disabled the scape keyword eventTry this:try this,During my application development ...I also met the trouble that default values for a model attribute => data-keyboard="true",

How do I copy the text inside a div to the clipboard? I have a div and need to add a link which will add the text to the clipboard. Is there a solution for this? After I click copy text, then I press Ctrl + V, it must be pasted.Edit as of 2016As of 2016, you can now copy text to the clipboard in most browsers because most browsers have the ability to programmatically copy a selection of text to the clipboard using document.execCommand("copy") that works off a selection.As with some other actions in a browser (like opening a new window), the copy to clipboard can only be done via a specific user action (like a mouse click).  For example, it cannot be done via a timer.Here's a code example:Here's a little more advanced demo: https://jsfiddle.net/jfriend00/v9g1x0o6/And, you can also get a pre-built library that does this for you with clipboard.js.Old, historical part of answerDirectly copying to the clipboard via JavaScript is not permitted by any modern browser for security reasons. The most common workaround is to use a Flash capability for copying to the clipboard that can only be triggered by a direct user click.As mentioned already, ZeroClipboard is a popular set of code for managing the Flash object to do the copy. I've used it. If Flash is installed on the browsing device (which rules out mobile or tablet), it works.The next most common work-around is to just place the clipboard-bound text into an input field, move the focus to that field and advise the user to press Ctrl + C to copy the text.Other discussions of the issue and possible work-arounds can be found in these prior Stack Overflow posts:These questions asking for a modern alternative to using Flash have received lots of question upvotes and no answers with a solution (probably because none exist):Internet Explorer and Firefox used to have non-standard APIs for accessing the clipboard, but their more modern versions have deprecated those methods (probably for security reasons).There is a nascent standards effort to try to come up with a "safe" way to solve the most common clipboard problems (probably requiring a specific user action like the Flash solution requires), and it looks like it may be partially implemented in the latest versions of Firefox and Chrome, but I haven't confirmed that yet.There is another non-Flash way (apart from the Clipboard API mentioned in jfriend00's answer). You need to select the text and then execute the command copy to copy to the clipboard whatever text is currently selected on the page.For example, this function will copy the content of the passed element into the clipboard (updated with suggestion in the comments from PointZeroTwo):This is how it works:You can see a quick demo here:The main issue is that not all browsers support this feature at the moment, but you can use it on the main ones from:Update 1: This can be achieved also with a pure JavaScript solution (no jQuery):Notice that we pass the id without the # now.As madzohan reported in the comments below, there is some strange issue with the 64-bit version of Google Chrome in some cases (running the file locally). This issue seems to be fixed with the non-jQuery solution above.Madzohan tried in Safari and the solution worked but using document.execCommand('SelectAll') instead of using .select() (as specified in the chat and in the comments below).As PointZeroTwo points out in the comments, the code could be improved so it would return a success/failure result. You can see a demo on this jsFiddle.As a user pointed out in the Spanish version of StackOverflow, the solutions listed above work perfectly if you want to copy the content of an element literally, but they don't work that great if you want to paste the copied text with format (as it is copied into a input type="text", the format is "lost").A solution for that would be to copy  into a content editable div and then copy it using the execCommand in a similar way. Here there is an example - click on the copy button and then paste into the content editable box below:And in jQuery, it would be like this:clipboard.js is a nice utility that allows copying of text or HTML data to the clipboard without use of Flash. It's very easy to use; just include the .js and use something like this:clipboard.js is also on GitHub.Edit on Jan 15, 2016:  The top answer was edited today to reference the same API in my answer posted in August 2015.  The previous text was instructing users to use ZeroClipboard.  Just want to be clear that I didn't yank this from jfriend00's answer, rather the other way around.  Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication. 

If you don't want the text-to-be-coppied to be visible:

jQuery:HTML: With Line Breaks (Extention of the Answer from Alvaro Montoro) You can use this code for copy input value in page in Clipboard by click a buttonThis is HtmlThen for this html , we must use this JQuery CodeThis is the simplest solution for this questionEven better approach without flash or any other requirements is clipboard.js. All you need to do is add data-clipboard-target="#toCopyElement" on any button, initialize it new Clipboard('.btn'); and it will copy the content of DOM with id toCopyElement to clipboard. This is a snippet that copy the text provided in your question via a link.One limitation though is that it does not work on safari, but it works on all other browser including mobile browsers as it does not use flashIt is a simplest method to copy the contentjQuery simple solution.Should be triggered by user's click.It's very important that the input field does not have display: none. The browser will not select the text and therefore will not be copied. Use opacity: 0 with a width of 0px to fix the problem.you can just using this lib for easy realize the copy goal!https://clipboardjs.com/orhttps://github.com/zeroclipboard/zeroclipboardhttp://zeroclipboard.org/The text to copy is in text input,like:    <input type="text" id="copyText" name="copyText">  and, on button click above text should get copied to clipboard,so button is   like:<button type="submit" id="copy_button" data-clipboard-target='copyText'>Copy</button>  Your script should be like:For CDN filesnote: ZeroClipboard.swf and ZeroClipboard.js" file should be in the same folder as your file using this functionality is, OR you have to include like we include <script src=""></script> on our pages.Most of the proposed answers create an extra temporary hidden input element(s). Because most browsers nowadays support div content edit, I propose a solution that does not create hidden element(s), preserve text formatting and use pure JavaScript or jQuery library. Here is a minimalist skeleton implementation using the fewest lines of codes I could think of:Clipboard-polyfill library is a polyfill for the modern Promise-based asynchronous clipboard API.install in CLI:import as clipboard in JS fileexampleI'm using it in a bundle with require("babel-polyfill"); and tested it on chrome 67.

Does such a tool exist? Is it possible to extend Firebug or Chrome Developer Tools to add this feature?I finally found some time to create this tool. You can install SnappySnippet from Github. It allows easy HTML+CSS extraction from the specified (last inspected) DOM node. Additionally, you can send your code straight to CodePen or JSFiddle. Enjoy!SnappySnippet is open source, and you can find the code on GitHub.Since I've learned quite a lot while making this, I've decided to share some of the problems I've experienced and my solutions to them, maybe someone will find it interesting.At first I've tried retrieving the original CSS rules (coming from CSS files on the website). Quite amazingly, this is very simple thanks to window.getMatchedCSSRules(), however, it didn't work out well. The problem was that we were taking only a part of the HTML and CSS selectors that were matching in the context of the whole document, which were not matching anymore in the context of an HTML snippet. Since parsing and modifying selectors didn't seem like a good idea, I gave up on this attempt.Then, I've started from something that @CollectiveCognition suggested - getComputedStyle(). However, I really wanted to separate CSS form HTML instead of inlining all styles.The solution here wasn't very beautiful but quite straightforward. I've assigned IDs to all nodes in the selected subtree and used that ID to create appropriate CSS rules.Assigning IDs to the nodes worked out nicely, however I found out that each of my CSS rules has ~300 properties making the whole CSS unreadable.

Turns out that getComputedStyle() returns all possible CSS properties and values calculated for the given element. Some of them where empty, some had  browser default values. To remove default values I had to get them from the browser first (and each tag has different default values). The solution was to compare the styles of the element coming from the website with the same element inserted into an empty <iframe>. The logic here was that there are no style sheets in an empty <iframe>, so each element I've appended there had only default browser styles. This way I was able to get rid of most of the properties that were insignificant.Next thing I have spotted was that properties having shorthand equivalent were unnecessarily printed out (e.g. there was border: solid black 1px and then border-color: black;, border-width: 1px itd.).

To solve this I've simply created a list of properties that have shorthand equivalents and filtered them out from the results.The number of properties in each rule was significantly lower after the previous operation, but I've found that I sill had a lot of -webkit- prefixed properties that I've never hear of (-webkit-app-region? -webkit-text-emphasis-position?).

I was wondering if I should keep any of these properties because some of them seemed useful (-webkit-transform-origin, -webkit-perspective-origin etc.). I haven't figured out how to verify this, though, and since I knew that most of the time these properties are just garbage, I decided to remove them all.The next problem I have spotted was that the same CSS rules are repeated over and over (e.g. for each <li> with the exact same styles there was the same rule in the CSS output created).

This was just a matter of comparing rules with each other and combining these that had exactly the same set of properties and values. As a result, instead of #LI_1{...}, #LI_2{...} I got #LI_1, #LI_2 {...}.Since I was happy with the result, I moved to HTML. It looked like a mess, mostly because the outerHTML property keeps it formatted exactly as it was returned from the server.

The only thing HTML code taken from outerHTML needed was a simple code reformatting. Since it's something available in every IDE, I was sure that there is a JavaScript library that does exactly that. And it turns out that I was right (jquery-clean). What's more, I've got unnecessary attributes removal extra (style, data-ng-repeat etc.).Since there is a chance that in some circumstances filters mentioned above may break CSS in the snippet, I've made all of them optional. You can disable them from the Settings menu.Webkit browsers (not sure about FireBug) allow you to copy the HTML of an element easily, so that's one part of the process out of the way.Running this (in the javascript console) prior to copying the HTML for an element will move all the computed styles for the parent element given, as well as all child elements, into the inline style attribute which will then be available as part of the HTML.It's a total hack and you'll have alot of "junk" css attributes to wade through, but should at least get your started.I originally asked this question I was looking for a Chrome (or FireFox) solution, but I stumbled across this feature in Internet Explorer developer tools. Pretty much what I'm looking for (except for the javascript)I've created this tool years ago for the same purpose:

htmlclipperwith modern enhancements: ES5, HTML5, scoped CSS...you can programmatically extract a stylized div with:Enjoy.There is no plugins needed. It can be done very simply with Internet Explorer 11 native Developer Tools with just one click, very clean. Just right on an element and inspect that element, and right click on some block and choose "Copy element with styles". You can see it in the below image.It provides the css code very clean, like Lately I created a chrome extension "eXtract Snippet" for copying the inspected element, html and only the relevant css and media queries from a page. Note that this would give you the actual relevant CSS https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/extract-snippet/bfcjfegkgdoomgmofhcidoiampnpbdao?hl=en A tool with a single solution for this I'm unaware of, but you can use Firebug and Web Developer extension at the same time.Use Firebug to copy the html section you need (Inspect Element) and Web Developer to see which css is associated with an element (Calling Web Developer "View Style Information" - it works like Firebug's "Inspect Element", but instead of showing the html markup it shows the associated CSS with that markup).It's not exactly what you want (one click for everything), but it's pretty close, and at least intuitive.I also need this feature on Firebug!  Until then, another approach is to use this online service to remove classes and convert the css to inline styles.http://clipboardjs.com does this and quite well. Although your expectation of the copied version being exactly as in the original so you can play and learn with it, may not be realistic.Just copy the part you want from the webpage and paste it in the wysiwyg editor. Check the html source by clicking on the "source" button on the editor toolbar.I've found this most easiest way when I was working on a Drupal site. I use wysiwyg CKeditor.I've adapted the top voted answer as a dragabble bookmarklet.Just visit this page and drag the "Run jQuery Code" button to your bookmark bar.There is a firefox plugin that saves the whole page's HTML, CSS, etc.. but I have not seen one that does a partial save.I remember IE 5.5 had what you were looking for though ;)I gone through all the tools mentioned as answer here. But they give repeated, dirty HTML CSS with beautiful face you were staring up on. They don't give you JS.What I do:

2012-02-12 00:32:51Z

What does !important mean in CSS?Is it available in CSS 2? CSS 3?Where is it supported? All modern browsers?It means, essentially, what it says; that 'this is important, ignore subsequent rules, and any usual specificity issues, apply this rule!'In normal use a rule defined in an external stylesheet is overruled by a style defined in the head of the document, which, in turn, is overruled by an in-line style within the element itself (assuming equal specificity of the selectors). Defining a rule with the !important 'attribute' (?) discards the normal concerns as regards the 'later' rule overriding the 'earlier' ones.Also, ordinarily, a more specific rule will override a less-specific rule. So:Is normally overruled by:As the latter selector is more specific (and it doesn't, normally, matter where the more-specific selector is found (in the head or the external stylesheet) it will still override the less-specific selector (in-line style attributes will always override the 'more-', or the 'less-', specific selector as it's always more specific.If, however, you add !important to the less-specific selector's CSS declaration, it will have priority.Using !important has its purposes (though I struggle to think of them), but it's much like using a nuclear explosion to stop the foxes killing your chickens; yes, the foxes will be killed, but so will the chickens. And the neighbourhood.It also makes debugging your CSS a nightmare (from personal, empirical, experience).So, if you have the following:the rule with the important will be the one applied (not counting specificity)I believe !important appeared in CSS1 so every browser supports it (IE4 to IE6 with a partial implementation, IE7+ full)Also, it's something that you don't want to use pretty often, because if you're working with other people you can override other properties.!important is a part of CSS1.Browsers supporting it: IE5.5+, Firefox 1+, Safari 3+, Chrome 1+.It means, something like:Use me, if there is nothing important else around!Cant say it better.It is used to influence sorting in the CSS cascade when sorting by origin is done.

It has nothing to do with specificity like stated here in other answers.Here is the priority from lowest to highest:After that specificity takes place for the rules still having a finger in the pie.References: It changes the rules for override priority of css cascades.  See the CSS2 spec.

Is there a straight forward CSS way to make the border of an element semi-transparent with something like this?If not, does anyone have an idea how I could do so without using images?

2010-10-31 05:48:53Z

Is there a straight forward CSS way to make the border of an element semi-transparent with something like this?If not, does anyone have an idea how I could do so without using images?Unfortunately the opacity element makes the whole element (including any text) semi-transparent. The best way to make the border semi-transparent is with the rgba color format. For example, this would give a red border with 50% opacity:The problem with this approach is that some browsers do not understand the rgba format and will not display any border at all if this is the entire declaration. The solution is to provide two border declarations. The first with a fake opacity, and the second with the actual. If a browser is capable, it will use the second, if not, it will use the first.The first border declaration will be the equivalent color to a 50% opaque red border over a white background (although any graphics under the border will not bleed through).UPDATE: I've added "background-clip: padding-box;" to this answer (per  SooDesuNe's suggestion in the comments) to ensure the border remains transparent even if a solid background color is applied.It's easy, use a solid shadow with 0 offset:Also, if you set a border-radius to the element, it gives you pretty rounded bordersjsFiddle DemoAs others have mentioned: CSS-3 says that you can use the rgba(...) syntax to specify a border color with an opacity (alpha) value.  here's a quick example if you'd like to check it.  There's also this stackoverflow post, which suggests some other issues--namely, that the border renders on-top-of any background color (or background image) that you've specified; thus limiting the usefulness of border alpha in many cases.If you check your CSS coding with W3C validator, you will see if your CSS code is acceptable, even if it worked in the major browsers.Creating a transparent border via CSS, as written above, is not accepted by W3C standards, not even for CSS3. I used the direct input validator with the following CSS code, The results were, Unfortunate that the alpha value (the letter "a" at the end of "rgb") is not accepted by W3C as part of the border color values as yet. I do wonder why it is not standardized, since it works in all browsers. The only hitch is whether you want to stick to W3C standards or step aside from it to create something in CSS.To use W3C online CSS validator / Direct Input.Always a good idea to use a validator to check your work, it really helps finding small or even large errors in coding when your going cross-eyed after hours of coding work.*Not as far as i know there isn't what i do normally in this kind of circumstances is create a block beneath with a bigger size((bordersize*2)+originalsize) and make it transparent usinghere is an exampleUpdate:This answer is outdated, since after all this question is more than 8 years old. Today all up to date browsers support rgba, box shadows and so on. But this is a decent example how it was 8+ years ago.As an alternate solution that may work in some cases: change the border-style to dotted.Having alternating groups of pixels between the foreground color and the background color isn't the same as a continuous line of partially transparent pixels. On the other hand, this requires significantly less CSS and it is much more compatible across every browser without any browser-specific directives.Other answers deal with the technical aspect of the border-opacity issue, while I'd like to present a hack(pure CSS and HTML only). Basically create a container div, having a border div and then the content div.And then the CSS:(set content border to none, take care of positioning such that border thickness is accounted for)try this:And here comes our magical CSS..Check out the Demo here.

You are correct that you would need to use something like jQuery or use additional class annotations to achieve the effect you want.Here are some similar questions with similar results: Only thing that comes even close is the :contains pseudo class in CSS3, but that only selects textual content, not tags or elements, so you're out of luck.A simpler way to select a parent with specific children in jQuery can be written as (with :has()):Is there any way you could programatically apply a class to the object?then do

For precaution you can keep its height auto so it can be rendered as per content's height.For a clear view of these function you can go for jQuery's site or a detailed post here.it will clear the difference between .height() / innerHeight() / outerHeight()I use this:It also works when you use the virtual DOM. I use it in Vue like this:then simply: style.heightDefinitely use orI'm posting this as an additional answer because theres a couple important things I just learnt.I almost fell into the trap just now of using offsetHeight. This is what happened :Here's just a portion of it :Yup it looks at BOTH scroll and offset. If that fails it looks even further, taking into account browser and css compatibility issues. In other words STUFF I DONT CARE ABOUT - or want to.But I dont have to. Thanks jQuery! Moral of the story : if jQuery has a method for something its probably for a good reason, likely related to compatibilty.If you haven't read through the jQuery list of methods recently I suggest you take a look.I made a simple code that doesn't even need JQuery and probably gonna help some people.

It gets the total height of 'ID1' after loaded and use it on 'ID2'Then just set the body to load itHm we can get the Element geometry...How about this plain JS ?So is this the answer? "If you need to calculate something but not show it, set the element to visibility:hidden and position:absolute, add it to the DOM tree, get the offsetHeight, and remove it. (That's what the prototype library does behind the lines last time I checked)."I have the same problem on a number of elements.  There is no jQuery or Prototype to be used on the site but I'm all in favor of borrowing the technique if it works.  As an example of some things that failed to work, followed by what did, I have the following code:which basically tries anything and everything only to get a zero result. ClientHeight with no affect.  With the problem elements I typically get NaN in the Base and zero in the Offset and Scroll heights.  I then tried the Add DOM solution and clientRects to see if it works here.29 Jun 2011,

I did indeed update the code to try both adding to DOM and clientHeight with better results than I expected.  1) clientHeight was also 0.2) Dom actually gave me a height which was great.3) ClientRects returns a result almost identical to the DOM technique.Because the elements added are fluid in nature, when they are added to an otherwise empty DOM Temp element they are rendered according to the width of that container.  This get weird, because that is 30px shorter than it eventually ends up.I added a few snapshots to illustrate how the height is calculated differently.

The height differences are obvious.   I could certainly add absolute positioning and hidden but I am sure that will have no effect.  I continued to be convinced this would not work!(I digress further) The height comes out (renders) lower than the true rendered height.  This could be addressed by setting the width of the DOM Temp element to match the existing parent and could be done fairly accurately in theory.  I also do not know what would result from removing them and adding them back into their existing location.  As they arrived through an innerHTML technique I will be looking using this different approach.* HOWEVER * None of that was necessary. In fact it worked as advertised and returned the correct height!!!When I was able to get the menus visible again amazingly DOM had returned the correct height per the fluid layout at the top of the page (279px).  The above code also uses getClientRects which return 280px.This is illustrated in the following snapshot (taken from Chrome once working.)

Now I have noooooo idea why that prototype trick works, but it seems to.  Alternatively, getClientRects also works.I suspect the cause of all this trouble with these particular elements was the use of innerHTML instead of appendChild, but that is pure speculation at this point.I think the best way to do this in 2020 is to use plain js and getBoundingClientRect().height;Here's an exampleOn top of getting height this way, we also have access to a bunch of other stuff about the div.offsetHeight, usually.If you need to calculate something but not show it, set the element to visibility:hidden and position:absolute, add it to the DOM tree, get the offsetHeight, and remove it. (That's what the prototype library does behind the scenes last time I checked).Sometimes offsetHeight will return zero because the element you've created has not been rendered in the Dom yet. I wrote this function for such circumstances:If you are using jQuery already, your best bet is .outerHeight() or .height(), as has been stated.Without jQuery, you can check the box-sizing in use and add up various paddings + borders + clientHeight, or you can use getComputedStyle:var h = getComputedStyle(document.getElementById('someDiv')).height;h will now be a string like a "53.825px".And I can't find the reference, but I think I heard getComputedStyle() can be expensive, so it's probably not something you want to call on each window.onscroll event (but then, neither is jQuery's height()).With MooTools:$('someDiv').getSize().yIf i understood your question correctly, then maybe something like this would help:Have you set the height in the css specifically? If you haven't you need to use offsetHeight; rather than height

Bootstrap 3 Navbar with Logo

[Bootstrap 3 Navbar with Logo](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/18474564/bootstrap-3-navbar-with-logo)

I want to use the Bootstrap 3 default navbar with an image logo instead of text branding. What's the proper way of doing this without causing any issues with different screen sizes? I assume this a common requirement, but I haven't yet seen a good code sample. A key requirement other than having acceptable display on all screen sizes is the menu collapsibility on smaller screens.I tried just putting an IMG tag inside the A tag that has the navbar-brand class, but that caused the menu not to function properly on my android phone. I also tried increasing the height of the navbar class, but that screwed things up even more.By the way, my logo image is larger than the height of the navbar.

I want to use the Bootstrap 3 default navbar with an image logo instead of text branding. What's the proper way of doing this without causing any issues with different screen sizes? I assume this a common requirement, but I haven't yet seen a good code sample. A key requirement other than having acceptable display on all screen sizes is the menu collapsibility on smaller screens.I tried just putting an IMG tag inside the A tag that has the navbar-brand class, but that caused the menu not to function properly on my android phone. I also tried increasing the height of the navbar class, but that screwed things up even more.By the way, my logo image is larger than the height of the navbar.Why is everyone trying to do it the hard way?  Sure, some of these approaches will work, but they're more complicated than is necessary.OK, first - you need an image that will fit within your navbar.  You can adjust your image via css height attribute (allowing width to scale) or you can just use an appropriately sized image.  Whatever you decide to do - the way this looks will depend on how well you size your image.For some reason, everyone wants to stick the image inside of an anchor with navbar-brand, and this isn't necessary.  navbar-brand applies text styles that aren't necessary to an image, as well as the navbar-left class (just like pull-left, but for use in a navbar).  All you really need is to add navbar-left.You can even follow this with a navbar-brand item, which will appear to the right of the image.There is currently a bug in Mozilla I discovered that breaks the navbar on certain browser widths with MANY DEMOS ON THIS PAGE. Basically the mozilla bug is including the left and right padding on the navbar brand link as part of the image width. However, this can be fixed easily and I've tested this out and I fairly sure it's the most stable working example on this page. It will resize automatically and works on all browsers. Just add this to your css and use navbar-brand the same way you would .img-responsive. Your logo will automatically fitAnother option is to use a background image. Use an image of any size and then just set the desired width:People seem to forget about object-fit a lot. Personally I think it's the easiest one to work with because the image automatically adjusts to the menu size. If you just use object fit on the image it will auto resize to the menus height.It was pointed out that this does not work in IE "yet". There is a polyfill, but that might be excessive if you don't plan on using it for anything else. It does look like object-fit is being planned for a future release of IE so once that happens this will work in all browsers. However, if you notice the .img-responsive class in bootstrap the max-width is assuming you are putting these images in columns or something that has an explicit with set. This would mean that 100% specifically means 100% width of the parent element. The reason we can't use that with the navbar is because the parent (.navbar-brand) has a fixed height of 50px, but the width is not set. If we take that logic and reverse it to be responsive based on the height we can have a responsive image that scales to the .navbar-brand height and by adding and auto set width it will adjust to proportion.Usually we would have to add display:block; to the scenario, but since navbar-brand already has float:left; applied to it, it automatically acts as a block element. You may run into the rare situation where your logo is too small. The img-responsive approach does not take this into account, but we will. By also adding the "height" attribute to the .navbar-brand > img you can be assured that it will scale up as well as down.So to complete this I put them both together and it seems to work perfectly in all browsers.Although your question is interesting i don't expect there will be one answer for it. Maybe your question is too broad.

Your solution should depend on: other content in the navbar (number of items), sizes of your logo, should your logo act responsive, etc.

Adding the logo in the a (with navbar-brand) seems a good starting point. I should use the navbar-brand class because this will add a padding (top / bottom) of 15 pixels.I test this setting on http://getbootstrap.com/examples/navbar/ with a logo of 300x150 pixels.Full screen > 1200:between 768 and 992 pixels (menu not collapsed):<768 (menu collapsed)Beside the aesthetic aspects i did not find any technical problem. On small screens a big logo will overlap or break out the viewport maybe.

Screens between 768 and 992 pixels also have other problems when the content doesn't fit in a line, see for example: https://github.com/bassjobsen/jamedo-bootstrap-start-theme/issues/18The default navbar has The default navbar example adds a bottom-margin of 30px so the content of your navbar should never overlap the content of your page. (fixed navbars will have problems when the height of the navbar varies).You will need some css and media queries to adapt the navbar to your need on different screen sizes. Please try to narrow your question. b.e. describe the problem you found on android.update see http://bootply.com/77512 for an example.interchange the button and the logo in your code, logo first (set float:left on the logo)set the margin-top for .navbar-collapse ul. Use logo height minus navbar height, to align to the bottom or (logo height - navbar height) / 2 to centerExample with a logo 100px x 100px, standard CSS:ExampleWell I finally got this same problem working, here is my solution and I tested it on my site in all three major browsers: Chrome, Firefox, and Internet Explorer.First of all if you are not using a text based logo then remove "navbar-brand" completely as I found this particular class to be the main cause of my collapsed nav menu doubling up.Shout out to user3137032 for leading me in the right direction.You have to make a custom responsive image container, I called mine "logo"Here is the bootstrap HTML mark up:And the CSS code:The value in @media (max-width: x) may vary depending on your logo images width, mine is 368px.  The percentages may need to be changed as well depending on your logo's size.  The first @media query should be your threshold and mine was image width (368px) + collapsed button size (44px) + about 60px and it came out to 480px which is where I start the responsive image scaling.Please be sure to remove my razor syntax from the HTML portions.  Let me know if it fixes your problem, it fixed mine.Edit:  Sorry, I missed your navbar height issue.  There are a couple ways to go about it, personally I compile the Bootstrap LESS with the appropriate navbar height, for my purposes I use 70px, and my image height is 68 px.  The second way to do it is in the bootstrap.css file itself, search for ".navbar" and change min-height: to the height of your logo.My solution is add css "display: inline-block" to img tag.DEMO: jsfiddleI use the img-responsive class and then set a max-width on the a element.  Like this:and the CSS:You must use code as this:Class of A tag must be "logo" not navbar-brand. It depends on how tall you want your logo to be.The default <a> height in the navbar is 20px, so if you specify height: 20px on your logo, it will allign nicely.However that's kind of small for a logo, so what I opted for was this:This makes the image 30px tall and vertically aligns the image by adding a negative margin to the top (5px is half of the difference between the padding on a and the size of the image).Alternately you could change the padding on the <a> element, eg:Quick Fix : Create a class for your logo and set the height to 28px. This works well with the navbar on all devices. Notice I said works "WELL" .My approach is to include FOUR different images of different sizes for phones, tablet, desktop, large desktop but only show ONE using bootstrap's responsive utility classes, as follow:Note: You can replace the commented line with the code provided. Replace the php code if you're not using wordpress.Edit Note2: Yes, this adds requests to your server when loading the page which might slow down a bit but if you use a background css sprite technique, chances are the logo doesn't get printed when printing a page and the code above should get better SEO.You shouldn't need to add additional CSS, since Bootstrap3 does provide it. Unless you do want to add it.

This is my code on putting the logo to the left and links to the right.

This navigation is responsive. Make changes to this as you see fit.HTML:I also implement it via css background property. It works healty in any width value.Another approach is to implement Bootstrap's built-in .text-hide class alongside of .navbar-brand to replace the brand text/content with a background image.CSS: HTML:This is a very consistent method and keeps your image centered. To adjust the size of the image all you need to do is adjust .navbar-brand width since the height is already set.Here's a live demo I had the same problem. I solved it like this:There is no navbar-brand class. The result looks like logo picture that fits navbar and works like a link. Also I recommend  to use navbar-right class for the menu items so they won't go below the logo.Maybe this is too simple, but I just copied the navbar-brand line so there are two of them, the image and then the text.And I created an image that fits inside the navbar (roughly 1/2 the height).If using LESS, this works:This code works perfect if you need to see the brand centered and with auto width in toolbar.

It contains the Wordpress function to get the image file from right path:my working code - bootstrap 3.0.3.

when navbar-toggle, hidden-xs original logo image.You might try using @media query such as below.Add a logo class first, then use @media to specify your logo height and width per device size. In the example below, I am targeting devices which have a max width of 320px (iPhone) You can play around with this until you find the best fit. Easy way to test: Use chrome or Firefox with inspect element. Shrink your browser as far as possible. Observe the logo size change based on the @media max width you specify. Test on iPhone, android devices, iPad etc to get the desired results.Please try following code: Failing to make any of the other answers work in my case (I probably didn't pass the intelligence test) and after some experimentation, this is what I am using (which I believe is very close to the Bootstrap default):And in the CSS file I have added the following:Note that @Html.ActionLink() is Razor syntax for an <a> tag. Where it says @Html.ActionLink(...) just replace it with an appropriate <a> tag. Equally where it says @Url.Action(...) replace it with an appropriate URL (no <a> tag in that case).This isn't semantic but I just use the existing a element, set a background image, then create multiple variations for @2x resolution, smaller screen sizes, etc.Then, you can use the .text-hide class to get some text on the page the ol' fashion way. Simple and effective though not proper use of an image.Here's a link to the helper class for text-replacement: http://getbootstrap.com/css/#helper-classesThe easiest and best answer for this question is to set a max width and height depending on your logo, the image will be a max of 50px high but no longer than 200px.This will vary depending on your logo size and the nav bar items you have.Please understand the code at your own effort :D This is my draft code and its already working :) Here's the screenshot.In stead of replacing text branding, I divided into two rows like in the code below and gave img-responsive class to the image......and in addition,I added the following css codes.......If my code solves your problem, it's my pleasure.....//Don't forgot to add bootstrap in head of your code.Add the following to the .navbar-brand class

Since you cannot apply a border to tr tag, you need to apply it to the td or th tags like so:Doing this will leave a small space between each td, which is likely not desirable if you want the border to appear as though it is the tr tag. In order to "fill in the gaps" so to speak, you need to utilize the border-collapse property on the table element and set its value to collapse, like so:Use Replace "thin solid" with CSS properties.Display the row as a block.and to display alternate colors simply:You can use the box-shadow property to fake a border of a tr element.

I am designing a new website and I want it to be compatible with as much browsers and browser settings as possible. I am trying to decide what unit of measurement I should use for the sizes of my fonts and elements, but am unable to find a conclusive answer.My question is: should I use px or rem in my CSS?I'm asking this because there are a lot of different opinions as to what is the most desirable measure of distance in CSS, and I am not sure which is best.TL;DR: use px.I think everyone agrees that it's good to design your pages to be accommodating to everyone, and to make consideration for the visually impaired.  One such consideration (but not the only one!) is allowing users to make the text of your site bigger, so that it's easier to read.In the beginning, the only way to provide users a way to scale text size was by using relative size units (such as ems).  This is because the browser's font size menu simply changed the root font size.  Thus, if you specified font sizes in px, they wouldn't scale when changing the browser's font size option.Modern browsers (and even the not-so-modern IE7) all changed the default scaling method to simply zooming in on everything, including images and box sizes.  Essentially, they make the reference pixel larger or smaller.Yes, someone could still change their browser default stylesheet to tweak the default font size (the equivalent of the old-style font size option), but that's a very esoteric way of going about it and I'd wager nobody1 does it.  (In Chrome, it's buried under the advanced settings, Web content, Font Sizes.  In IE9, it's even more hidden.  You have to press Alt, and go to View, Text Size.)  It's much easier to just select the Zoom option in the browser's main menu (or use Ctrl++/-/mouse wheel).1 - within statistical error, naturallyIf we assume most users scale pages using the zoom option, I find relative units mostly irrelevant.  It's much easier to develop your page when everything is specified in the same unit (images are all dealt with in pixels), and you don't have to worry about compounding.    ("I was told there would be no math" – there's dealing with having to calculate what 1.5em actually works out to.)One other potential problem of using only relative units for font sizes is that user-resized fonts may break assumptions your layout makes.  For example, this might lead to text getting clipped or running too long.  If you use absolute units, you don't have to worry about unexpected font sizes from breaking your layout.So my answer is use pixel units.  I use px for everything.  Of course, your situation may vary, and if you must support IE6 (may the gods of the RFCs have mercy on you), you'll have to use ems anyway.I would like to praise josh3736's answer for providing some excellent historical context. While it's well articulated, the CSS landscape has changed in the almost five years since this question was asked. When this question was asked, px was the correct answer, but that no longer holds true today.tl;dr: use remHistorically px units typically represented one device pixel. With devices having higher and higher pixel density this no longer holds for many devices, such as with Apple's Retina Display.rem units represent the root em size. It's the font-size of whatever matches :root. In the case of HTML, it's the <html> element; for SVG, it's the <svg> element. The default font-size in every browser* is 16px.At the time of writing, rem is supported by approximately 98% of users. If you're worried about that other 2%, I'll remind you that media queries are also supported by approximately 98% of users.The majority of CSS examples on the internet use px values because they were the de-facto standard. pt, in and a variety of other units could have been used in theory, but they didn't handle small values well as you'd quickly need to resort to fractions, which were longer to type, and harder to reason about.If you wanted a thin border, with px you could use 1px, with pt you'd need to use 0.75pt for consistent results, and that's just not very convenient.rem's default value of 16px isn't a very strong argument for its use. Writing 0.0625rem is worse than writing 0.75pt, so why would anyone use rem?There are two parts to rem's advantage over other units.Browser zoom has changed a lot over the years. Historically many browsers would only scale up font-size, but that changed pretty rapidly when websites realized that their beautiful pixel-perfect designs were breaking any time someone zoomed in or out. At this point, browsers scale the entire page, so font-based zooming is out of the picture.Respecting a user's wishes is not out of the picture. Just because a browser is set to 16px by default, doesn't mean any user can't change their preferences to 24px or 32px to correct for low vision or poor visibility (e.x. screen glare). If you base your units off of rem, any user at a higher font-size will see a proportionally larger site. Borders will be bigger, padding will be bigger, margins will be bigger, everything will scale up fluidly.If you base your media queries on rem, you can also make sure that the site your users see fits their screen. A user with font-size set to 32px on a 640px wide browser, will effectively be seeing your site as shown to a user at 16px on a 320px wide browser. There's absolutely no loss for RWD in using rem.Because rem is based on the font-size of the :root node, if you want to change what 1rem represents, all you have to do is change the font-size:Whatever you do, don't set the :root element's font-size to a px value.If you set the font-size on html to a px value, you've blown away the user's preferences without a way to get them back.If you want to change the apparent value of rem, use % units.The math for this is reasonably straight-forward.The apparent font-size of :root is 16px, but lets say we want to change it to 20px. All we need to do is multiply 16 by some value to get 20.Set up your equation:And solve for X:Doing everything in multiples of 20 isn't all that great, but a common suggestion is to make the apparent size of rem equal to 10px. The magic number for that is 10/16 which is 0.625, or 62.5%.The problem now is that your default font-size for the rest of the page is set way too small, but there's a simple fix for that: Set a font-size on body using rem:It's important to note, with this adjustment in place, the apparent value of rem is 10px which means any value you might have written in px can be converted directly to rem by bumping a decimal place.turns intoThe apparent font-size you choose is up to you, so if you want there's no reason you can't use:and have 1rem equal 1px.So there you have it, a simple solution to respect user wishes while also avoiding over-complicating your CSS.I was afraid you might ask that. As much as I'd like to pretend that rem is magic and solves-all-things, there are still some issues of note. Nothing deal-breaking in my opinion, but I'm going to call them out so you can't say I didn't warn you.One of the first issues you'll run into with rem involves media queries. Consider the following code:Here the value of rem changes depending on whether the media-query applies, and the media query depends on the value of rem, so what on earth is going on?rem in media queries uses the initial value of font-size and should not (see Safari section) take into account any changes that may have happened to the font-size of the :root element. In other words, it's apparent value is always 16px.This is a bit annoying, because it means that you have to do some fractional calculations, but I have found that most common media queries already use values that are multiples of 16.Additionally if you're using a CSS preprocessor, you can use mixins or variables to manage your media queries, which will mask the issue entirely.Unfortunately there's a known bug with Safari where changes to the :root font-size do actually change the calculated rem values for media query ranges. This can cause some very strange behavior if the font-size of the :root element is changed within a media query. Fortunately the fix is simple: use em units for media queries.If you switch between projects various different projects, it's quite possible that the apparent font-size of rem will have different values. In one project, you might be using an apparent size of 10px where in another project the apparent size might be 1px. This can be confusing and cause issues.My only recommendation here is to stick with 62.5% to convert rem to an apparent size of 10px, because that has been more common in my experience.If you're writing CSS that's going to be used on a site that you don't control, such as for an embedded widget, there's really no good way to know what apparent size rem will have. If that's the case, feel free to keep using px.If you still want to use rem though, consider releasing a Sass or LESS version of the stylesheet with a variable to override the scaling for the apparent size of rem.* I don't want to spook anyone away from using rem, but I haven't been able to officially confirm that every browser uses 16px by default. You see, there are a lot of browsers and it wouldn't be all that hard for one browser to have diverged ever so slightly to, say 15px or 18px. In testing, however I have not seen a single example where a browser using default settings in a system using default settings had any value other than 16px. If you find such an example, please share it with me.This article describes pretty well the pros and cons of px, em, and rem.The author finally concludes that the best method is probably to use both px and rem, declaring px first for older browsers and redeclaring rem for newer browsers:As a reflex answer, I would recommend using rem, because it allows you to change the "zoom level" of the whole document at once, if necessary. In some cases, when you want the size to be relative to the parent element, then use em.But rem support is spotty, IE8 needs a polyfill, and Webkit is exhibiting a bug. Moreover, sub-pixel calculation can cause things such as one pixel lines to sometimes disappear. The remedy is to code in pixels for such very small elements. That introduces even more complexity.So, overall, ask yourself whether it's worth it - how important and likely it is that you change the "zoom level" of the whole document within CSS?For some cases it's yes, for some cases it'll be no.So, it depends on your needs, and you have to weight pros and cons, because using rem and em introduces some additional considerations in comparison to the "normal" pixel-based workflow.Keep in mind that it's easy to switch (or rather convert) your CSS from px to rem (JavaScript is another story), because the following two blocks of CSS code would produce the same result:josh3736's answer is a good one, but to provide a counterpoint 3 years later:I recommend using rem units for fonts, if only because it makes it easier for you, the developer, to change sizes. It's true that users very rarely change the default font size in their browsers, and that modern browser zoom will scale up px units. But what if your boss comes to you and says "don't enlarge the images or icons, but make all the fonts bigger". It's much easier to just change the root font size and let all the other fonts scale relative to that, then to change px sizes in dozens or hundreds of css rules.I think it still makes sense to use px units for some images, or for certain layout elements that should always be the same size regardless of the scale of the design.Caniuse.com may have said that only 75% of browsers when josh3736 posted his answer in 2012, but as of March 27 they claim 93.78% support. Only IE8 doesn't support it among the browsers they track.I've found the best way to program the font sizes of a website are to define a base font size for the body and then use em's (or rem's) for every other font-size I declare after that.  That's personal preference I suppose, but it's served me well and also made it very easy to incorporate a more responsive design.As far as using rem units go, I think it's good to find a balance between being progressive in your code, but to also offer support for older browsers.  Check out this link about browser support for rem units, that should help out a good amount on your decision.pt is similar to rem, in that it's relatively fixed, but almost always DPI-independent, even when non-compliant browsers treat px in a device-dependent fashion.  rem varies with the font size of the root element, but you can use something like Sass/Compass to do this automatically with pt.If you had this:then 1rem would always be 12pt.  rem and em are only as device-independent as the elements on which they rely; some browsers don't behave according to spec, and treat px literally.  Even in the old days of the Web, 1 point was consistently regarded as 1/72 inch--that is, there are 72 points in an inch.If you have an old, non-compliant browser, and you have:then 1rem is going to be device-dependent.  For elements that would inherit from html by default, 1em would also be device-dependent.  12pt would be the hopefully guaranteed device-independent equivalent: 16px / 96px * 72pt = 12pt, where 96px = 72pt = 1in.It can get pretty complicated to do the math if you want to stick to specific units.  For example, .75em of html = .75rem = 9pt, and .66em of .75em of html = .5rem = 6pt.  A good rule of thumb:Yes, REM and PX are relative yet other answers have suggested to go for REM over PX, I would also like to back this up using an accessibility example.

When user sets different font-size on browser, REM automatically scale up and down elements like fonts, images etc on the webpage which is not the case with PX.  In the below gif left side text is set using font size REM unit while right side font is set by PX unit.Default font-size of a webpage is 16px which is equal to 1 rem (only for default html page i.e. html{font-size:100%}), so, 1.25rem is equal to 20px.P.S: who else is using REM? CSS Frameworks! like Bootstrap 4, Bulma CSS etc, so better get along with it.Half (but only half) snarky answer (the other half is bitter disdain of the reality of bureaucracy):Use vhEverything is always sized to browser window. Always allow scroll down, never to the side.Set body width to be a static 50vh, and nothing floats or breaks out of the parent div. And style only using tables so everything is held rigidly into place as expected. Include a javascript function to undo any ctrl+/- activity the user may do.Everybody will hate you except the people who tell you to make things match their mock-up, and they will be ecstatic. And everyone knows their opinion is the only one that matters.Yes. Or, rather, no. Er, I mean, it doesn't matter. Use the one that makes sense for your particular project. PX and EM or both equally valid but will behave a bit different depending on your overall page's CSS architecture. UPDATE:To clarify, I'm stating that usually it likely doesn't matter which you use. At times, you may specifically want to choose one over the other. EMs are nice if you can start from scratch and want to use a base font size and make everything relative to that. PXs are often needed when you're retrofitting a redesign onto an existing code base and need the specificity of px to prevent bad nesting issues.em's are the way forward, not just for fonts but you can use them with boxes, line thickness and other stuff too, why?Put simply em's are the only ones that scale in unison with the alt+ and alt- keys in the browser for zooming.Other measurements scale, but not as cleanly as an em.On a side note if you want the best in scaling, also convert your graphics to vector based SVG where possible too as these will also cleanly scale with the browsers zoom ratio.EMs are the ONLY thing that scales for media queries that handle +/- scaling, which people do all the time, not just blind people. Here's another very well written professional demonstration of why this matters.By the way, this is why Zurb Foundation uses ems, while the inferior Bootstrap 3 still uses pixels.

What exactly is the difference between margin and padding in CSS? It really doesn't seem to serve much purpose. Could you give me an example of where the differences lie (and why it is important to know the difference)?padding is the space between the content and the border, whereas margin is the space outside the border. Here's an image I found from a quick Google search, that illustrates this idea.One key thing that is missing in the answers here:Top/Bottom margins are collapsible.So if you have a 20px margin at the bottom of an element and a 30px margin at the top of the next element, the margin between the two elements will be 30px rather than 50px. This does not apply to left/right margin or padding.Margin is applied to the outside of you element hence effecting how far your element is away from other elements.  Padding is applied to the inside of your element hence effecting how far your element's content is away from the border.Also, using margin will not affect your element's dimensions whereas padding will make your elements dimensions (set height + padding) so for example if you have a 100x100px div with a 5 px padding, your div will actually be 105x105pxRemember these 3 points:Demo Image:(where red box is desire control)

The simplest defenition is ;

 padding is a space given inside the border of the container element and margin is given outside. 

For a element which is not a container, padding may not make much sense, but margin defenitly will help to arrange it.Padding is space inside the border, whereas Margin is space outside the border.PaddingPadding is a CSS property that defines the space between an element content and its border (if it has a border). If an element has a border around it, padding will give space from that border to the element content which appears in that border. If an element does not have a border around it, then adding padding has no effect at all on that element, because there is no border to give space from.MarginMargin is a CSS property that defines the space of outside of an element to its next outside element.Margin affects elements that both have or do not have borders. If an element has a border, margin defines the space from this border to the next outer element. If an element does not have a border, then margin defines the space from the element content to the next outer element.Difference Between Padding and MarginSo the difference between margin and padding is that while padding deals with the inner space, margin deals with the outer space to the next outer element.margin = space around (outside) the element from border outwards.padding = space around (inside) the element from text to border.see here: http://jsfiddle.net/robx/GaMpq/It is good to know about the differences between margin and padding. As I know:One of the key differences between margin and padding is not mentioned in any of the answers: clickability and hover detection  Increasing the padding increases the effective size of the element. Sometimes I have a smallish icon that I don't want to make visibly larger but the user still needs to interact with that icon.  I increase the icon's padding to give it a larger footprint for clicks and hover.  Increasing the icon's margin will not have the same effect.An answer to another question on this topic gives an example.Margin is space outside the box; padding is space inside the box. It's hard to see the difference with a white fill, but with a colored fill you can see it fine.Margin and padding are both types of padding really....One (margin) goes outside of the elements border to distance it from other elements and the other (padding) goes outside of the elements content to distance the content from the elements border.Padding allows the developer to maintain space between the text and it's enclosing element. Margin is the space that the element maintains with another element of the parent DOM.See example:Try putting a background color on a block div with width and height. You'll see that padding increases the size of the element, whereas margin just moves it within the flow of the document.Margin is specifically for shifting the element around.Padding is the space between nearest components on the web page and margin is the space from the margin of the webpage. Margin is a property in CSS that is used to create spaces around the elements, outside of the border. The programmer can set the margin for top, right, bottom and left. In other words, he can set those values using margin-top, margin-right, margin-bottom and margin-left.The Margin values can be of the following types.First, auto allows the browser to calculate the margin. Moreover, length denotes a margin in px, pt or cm, while % helps to describe a margin as a percentage relative to the width of the containing element. Finally, inherit denotes that the margin has to inherit from the parent element.Padding is a property in CSS that helps to create space around an element inside the border. The programmer can set the padding for top, right, bottom and left.  In other words, he can set those values using padding-top, padding-right, padding-bottom and padding-left.The Padding  values can be of the following types.  The length describes padding in px, pt or cm, while % denotes padding as a percentage relative to the width of the containing element. Finally, inherit describes that the padding should be inherited from the parent element.Difference Between Margin and PaddingMargin is a CSS property that is used to create space around the element outside the defined border, while the padding is a CSS property that is used to create space around the element, inside the defined border. Thus, this explains the main difference between margin and padding.Values

Furthermore, the values of margin can be auto, length, % or inherit, whereas the values of padding can be length, % or inherit type. Hence, this is another difference between margin and padding.In brief, margin and padding are two properties in CSS that allows styling the web pages. It is not possible to assign negative values for those properties. The main difference between margin and padding is that margin helps to create space around the element outside the border, while padding helps to create space around the element inside the border.One thing I just noticed but none of above answers mentioned.  If I have a dynamically created DOM element which is initialized with empty inner html content, it's a good practice to use margin instead of padding if you don't want this empty element occupy any space except its content is created.There is one important difference:Margin- is on the outside of the element i.e. one will apply the whitespace shift "after" the element begins.

Padding- is on the inside, the other will apply the whitespace "before" the element begins.Margin is applied to the outside of you element hence effecting how far your element is away from other elements.Padding is applied to the inside of your element hence effecting how far your element's content is away from the border.Also, using margin will not affect your element's dimensions whereas padding will make your elements dimensions (set height + padding) so for example if you have a 100x100px div with a 5 px padding, your div will actually be 105x105pxBasically, the difference between padding and margin come in terms of the background. Padding will decide the space between content, while margin decide the outside edge of elements!Padding is the space between you content and the border. Where as Margin is the space between the border and the other element.

Sometimes I use anchors styled as buttons and sometimes I just use buttons. I want to disable specific clicky-things so that:How can I do this?

2013-05-27 16:13:34Z

Sometimes I use anchors styled as buttons and sometimes I just use buttons. I want to disable specific clicky-things so that:How can I do this?Buttons are simple to disable as disabled is a button property which is handled by the browser:To disable these with a custom jQuery function, you'd simply make use of fn.extend():JSFiddle disabled button and input demo.Otherwise you'd make use of jQuery's prop() method:It's worth noting that disabled isn't a valid property for anchor tags. For this reason, Bootstrap uses the following styling on its .btn elements:Note how the [disabled] property is targeted as well as a .disabled class. The .disabled class is what is needed to make an anchor tag appear disabled.Of course, this will not prevent links from functioning when clicked. The above link will take us to http://example.com. To prevent this, we can add in a simple piece of jQuery code to target anchor tags with the disabled class to call event.preventDefault():We can toggle the disabled class by using toggleClass():JSFiddle disabled link demo.We can then extend the previous disable function made above to check the type of element we're attempting to disable using is(). This way we can toggleClass() if it isn't an input or button element, or toggle the disabled property if it is:Full combined JSFiddle demo.It's worth further noting that the above function will also work on all input types.I can't think a simpler/easier way! ;-)Using Anchor tags (Links) :To enable the Anchor tag:To disable the Anchor tag:Suppose you have text field and submit button,To disable any button, for example, submit button you just need to add disabled attribute as,After executing above line, your submit button html tag would look like this:Notice the 'disabled' attribute has added.For enabling button, such as when you have some text in text field. You will need to remove the disable attribute to enable button as,Now the above code will remove the 'disabled' attribute.I know I'm late to the party, but to specifically answer the two questions:"I just want to disable specific clicky-things so that:How hard can this be?"They stop clicking1.  For buttons like <button> or <input type="button"> you add the attribute: disabled.2.  For links, ANY link... actually, any HTML element, you can use CSS3 pointer events.Browser support for pointer events is awesome by today's state of the art (5/12/14). But we usually have to support legacy browsers in the IE realm, so IE10 and below DO NOT support pointer events: http://caniuse.com/pointer-events. So using one of the JavaScript solutions mentioned by others here may be the way to go for legacy browsers.More info about pointer events:They look disabledObviously this a CSS answer, so: 1.  For buttons like <button> or <input type="button"> use the [attribute] selector:--Here's a basic demo with the stuff I mentioned here: http://jsfiddle.net/bXm5B/4/Hope this helps.If, like me, you just want to disable a button, don't miss the simple answer subtly hidden in this long thread:@James Donnelly has supplied a comprehensive answer that relies on extending jQuery with a new function. That is a great idea, so I am going to adapt his code so it works the way I need it to.Extending jQueryUsageThe code will process a single element or a list of elements.Buttons and Inputs support the disabled property and, if set to true, they will look disabled (thanks to bootstrap) and will not fire when clicked. Anchors don't support the disabled property so instead we are going to rely on the .disabled class to make them look disabled (thanks to bootstrap again) and hook up a default click event that prevents the click by returning false (no need for preventDefault see here). Note: You do not need to unhook this event when re-enabling anchors. Simply removing the .disabled class does the trick. Of course, this does not help if you have attached a custom click handler to the link, something that is very common when using bootstrap and jQuery. So to deal with this we are going tro use the isDisabled() extension to test for the .disabled class, like this:I hope that helps simplify things a bit.Note that there's a weird problem if you're using Bootstrap's JS buttons and the 'loading' state. I don't know why this happens, but here's how to fix it.Say you have a button and you set it to the loading state:Now you want to take it out of the loading state, but also disable it (e.g. the button was a Save button, the loading state indicated an ongoing validation and the validation failed). This looks like reasonable Bootstrap JS:Unfortunately, that will reset the button, but not disable it. Apparently, button() performs some delayed task. So you'll also have to postpone your disabling:A bit annoying, but it's a pattern I'm using a lot.Great answer and contributions from all! I had to extend this function slightly to include disabling of select elements:Seems to be working for me. Thanks all!For that kind of behavior I always use the jQueryUI button widget, I use it for links and buttons.Define the tag within HTML:Use jQuery to initialize the buttons:Use the button widget methods to disable/enable them:That will take care of the button and cursor behavior, but if you need to get deeper and change the button style when disabled then overwrite the following CSS classes within your page CSS style file.But remember: those CSS classes (if changed) will change the style for other widgets too.The following has worked for me very well:This is a rather late answer, however I stumbled upon this question while searching for a way to disable boostrap buttons after clicking them and maybe add a nice effect (f.e a spinner). I've found a great library that does exactly that:http://msurguy.github.io/ladda-bootstrap/You just include the required css and js, add some properties to your buttons and enable lada with javascript... Presto ! Your buttons have a new life (please check the demo to see how beautiful it is) !This above does not work because sometimes adjust your code withI know my answer is late, but IMO this is the easiest way to toggle a Button 'enable' and button 'disable'Suppose you have these buttons on page like :The js code:Say you have that looks like this that is currently enable.Just add this:and you will get this which will disable button
