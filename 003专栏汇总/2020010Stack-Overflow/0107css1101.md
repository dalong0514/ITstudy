I have an element that has inset box shadows, but I want the shadow on only the top.Is there no way to set only the top shadow? Do I have to resort to creating additional elements to overlay the side shadows?This is technically the same answer as @ChrisJ, with a few more details on how to make box-shadow do your bidding:for reference the * items are optional:The <spread-radius> needs to be negative <blur-radius> (so that none of the other blurred sides show up), and then you need to bump the <offset-y> down by the same amount:It will give you a single gradient band across the top of the element.box-shadow offsets the shadow by a given amount in each direction. So you need x-offset to be 0, and y-offset to be something negative.Additionally, you have to play with the blur-radius and spread-radius so that the shadow is not visible on the left and right sides.Example:See the description on the Mozilla Developer Network.A better way would be using a background gradient, here are both side to side.http://jsfiddle.net/wh3L8/Example:The First parameter and second parameters specifies the offset of shadow to x-direction and y-direction respectively.

Third parameter specifies the blur distance.

Finally, the fourth parameter specifies the spread distance.Specifying only the second parameter with the offset you want gives the top shadow without side shadows.Demo can be found here: http://jsfiddle.net/rEdBy/A very nice tutorial on CSS3 Box shadows - http://www.css3.info/preview/box-shadow/ Here is my example please try onceHere's a little hack that I did.Maybe try using box-shadow:box-shadow: h-shadow v-shadow blur spread color inset;with overflow-x:overflow-x: visible|hidden|scroll|auto|no-display|no-content;use overflow-x: hidden; and box-shadow: 0px 10px 16px -10px #000;

I have the HTML:and CSS:In the browser, spans display in the reverse order:  Import Export Settings.

Can I change the order by changing only the CSS file and leave the HTML as is?

I have the HTML:and CSS:In the browser, spans display in the reverse order:  Import Export Settings.

Can I change the order by changing only the CSS file and leave the HTML as is?The general solution to this problem is either to reverse the order of the right floated elements in the HTML, or wrap them in a containing element and float that to the right instead.If you want to make your list items aligned right without reversing the order dont float your list items. Make them inline instead. text-align:right your span Yes, this can be done with your exact markup.The trick is to use direction: rtl;FIDDLEUsing flex, flex-flow and order:Alternatively, reverse the Y scale:very easy!Float the div right instead of the span elements? Just use display:inline-block and text-align:right instead of float:right:Or you can use the flex displayAnswering your updated question:I say "path to div" above because you need to adequately target this one div, which doesn't (according to your quoted code) have a class or ID of its own. That's not a problem if we can do it with structure.So for instance, if the div is the only div within a container with the id (say) "navigation", that might be:Or if there are other divs in the container, but this is the only one that's 

a direct child of the navigation container, you can use a child selector instead of a descendant selector:This works without rearranging the html and is very simple.

Please note that this will work only on IE10+I get also stuck with this... so here is my sollutionI had this Before and want this AfterHTML looks like thisCSS looks like thishtmlcssyou would need to float the spans left, and float the parent container right.this will depend on the kind of layout you are trying to achieve however.it's intended behaviour, for the benefit of screen readers and the like I imagine.  the other option is to adjust the mark-up, but this, as you say, may not be desirable.

What I'm looking to get is 7.5.Here's my solution using jQuery.This returns a numerical value corresponding to the rotation applied to any HTML element.etc...I've found a bug/features in the Twist's code: the function return negative angles.So I've add a simple line of code before returning the angle:Than the results will be:My Solution (using jQuery):Usage:Here is a plug-in version of Twist's function. Also, the conditional if(matrix !== 'none') did not work for me. So I have added type-checking:Use as follows:The CSS tranform property will always return a matrix value, as rotate, skew, scale etc. is just shorthand for doing things easier, and not having to calculate the matrix value everytime, however the matrix is calculated by the browser and applied as a matrix, and when that is done it can no longer return the rotated degree by angle without recalculating the matrix back again.To make such calcualtions easier there is a javascript library called Sylvester that was created for the purpose of easy matrix calculation, try looking at that to get the rotation degree from the matrix value.Also, if you where to write a rotate function in javascript to translate rotational degrees to  a matrix, it would probably look something like this (this uses sylvester for the last calculation) :Now all you really have to do is reverse enginer that function and you're golden :-)This script is very helpful

https://github.com/zachstronaut/jquery-css-transformI have make a fiddle with this working code to get rotateX Y Z on a 3D , or rotateZ for a 2D transform. Thanks to mihn for the base code that i have little updated with actual jquery 2.2.3.

I currently use this solution for my own projects.https://jsfiddle.net/bragon95/49a4h6e9/If you do this in the way you described, any this is the only place where you actually modify transform of the object, then since your browser can not be all 4 kinds of browsers at the same time, some of the prefixed values you assigned are still exactly as you assigned them.

So for example if you use webkit, then this.css('-o-transform') will still return 'rotate(7.5deg)', so it is just a matter of matching it against /rotate\((.*)deg\)/.This worked fine for me : I always assign 5 css styles, and read back all five styles, hoping that at least one of them will be untouched. I am not sure if this works if the styles are set in CSS (not in JS) though.Also you could replace var angle = Math.round(Math.atan2(b, a) * (180/Math.PI)); to var angle = Math.round(Math.acos(a) * (180/Math.PI));Since I constantly need to use jQuery together with TweenMax and since TweenMax already took care of all the parsing of various types of transformation strings as well as compatibility issues, I wrote a tiny jquery plugin here (more of a wrap up of gsap's) that could directly access these values like this:The list of properties you could get/set, along with their initial properties:Paste from my other answer, hope this helps.If you're willing to use in-line styling for just this transformation, then you can use jQuery to get the contents of the style tag:

Less extra html markups will be better.Many thanks to you all.You need text-indent. Normally text-indent pushes the first line inwards, but if you give it a minus figure and use a positive margin, you can achieve the effect you're after.Not usable right now but if you activate the Experimental Web platform Flag on chrome you can use text-indent:1em each-line; which should do exactly what you want.text-indent on MDNOn inline elements maybe it works differently, I have noticed.  I was needing an "outdent" (first line further left than rest of paragraph) and noticed the suggestions above did the opposite -- created a regular indent (where first line is further RIGHT than other lines).  Here is what works for an inline element, for example, an "a" tag:I also set the containing block-level element to have a margin of 1em, so that where the inline "a" elements commence, with their negative margins, they actually position exactly where I things would have been originally before messing around to make an "outdent".Hope this helps someone!

Using this you can override the browser's automatic column resizing. Then your browser sets the column width of first column to all.The table should have width: 100% property.

See example hereAbout the text alignment you said two different things:and then If the first is what you want and you cannot change your HTML you can use td:first-child to style your first column differently.

the key thing to understand here is that position:relative in .wrapper will "contain" any element that has position:absolute. It's like declaring boundaries for .bottom. Without position:relative in .wrapper, .bottom would break out of that divI run to a similiar problem. The solution from Val is good, but has one issue - the inner div will stick to bottom, but it will not affect the height of parrent div, thanks to its "position: absolute;" (it is out of the page layout flow).So here is my expanded solution for anyone having similiar problem:As you can see, I set height of the .bottom ang padding-bottom of the wrapper. Disadvantage is, that the height of the footer is on two places. But I think it is a good solution for example for product list, where there is fixed height in footer of the box (like for price etc). Remember, that everytime you set "position: absolute;", the element will be absolutely positioned against first parent div, which has set position attribute. Or, eventualy, against the page itself.

I was wondering if there is such an addon in firefox where you can test out css paths to check if they are finding the correct element?  I was looking for something similar to xpather for xpath locations.Edit 2019-12-04:The firefinder addon no longer exists, but you can use the developer console (press F12), and the $$ function to get elements matching a selector, eg. to select all divs: $$('div') Old answer:FireFinder does exactly what you are looking for. You can evaluate either CSS, or XPath expressions, it will list the matching elements, and also draw a red border around them.Yes you can go for FireBug, a versatile Firefox web development add-on.To test a CSS selector, go to the "Console" tab and enter a command in the bottom form (more info on how to find the command line).Inside the command line use the $$("your CSS selector") syntax to test CSS selectors, explained in more detail here. For example use this command to select everything:Here's how to use the  built in CSS query selector in Firefox:Go to Tools > Web Developer > Web ConsoleAlso, you could press ctrl shift i in Windows/Linux, or cmd opt i in Mac.Type in your CSS selector (using traditional $$() syntax) at the very bottom left corner.The object node list will appear on the right hand panel of the console.This is handy for Selenium Webdriver instances of Firefox, where having an extension isn't feasible.Try firebug. http://getfirebug.com/Not sure if this helps. Try Firebug. Allows you to select an item, and see what it's css path is, as well as the css currently being applied.Can do some experimentation in the html/css right in the browser.FireFinder is good, but I started with and prefer FirePath for Firebug. It works similarly, but can give you an expanded view of the HTML around the matching elements w/o need to click inspect, FriendlyFire, etc.The field where you test the locator also has syntax checker where field turns red if syntax is bad. Just click eval to test the locator and matches show below with additional HTML around the matching elements.But for testing CSS locator, you'd want the drop down option of "Sizzle" rather than CSS in FirePath. The CSS option only works for simple CSS selectors, complex ones only work under Sizzle (l mode, such as:div.namedService.photoService > div.photoBrowserContainer:nth-child(3) > div.albumName:contains('someName')Selenium IDE 1.0.11 released has inbuilt CSS locator builderThe DOM standard function document.querySelectorAll is what you want, modern browser all support it. See the documenthttps://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/DOM/Document.querySelectorAllYou can call it in built-in web console. In console there is a shortcut $$, call it like $$('div a').I like firebug because it can click to scroll to view the element. It also can test in 'CSS' panel.The 'Find' button in Selenium IDE is very useful for this. It uses the same method to locate elements as your tests will, so can be used to locate elements using any of the supported strategies.With jQuery you could easily add a large red border to an element using the selector.Firebug (https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/1843) or Web Developer Toolbar (https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/60). Both show path.Firefinder is great for testing selectors. However, if also you want to obtain the CSS selector for an element try SelectorGadget.I've found FirePath to be really great, it lets you look up not only CSS but xPath as well. Wish there was something similar for Chrome and IE, but alas!

You're not going to reach very far in terms of browser support (IE8 and older) unless you add classes to your first and last children, using JavaScript or otherwise.Remember that vertical margins collapse between in-flow paragraphs and their ancestor(s), so unless you want to zero out the margins of the container element for these paragraphs as well, you shouldn't need to zero out the margins of the first and last p elements specifically. Here's a fiddle to illustrate.Well, you could do:But only the most recent browsers support the :not psuedo-class.Other than that, no. Your best option is to specify a style for all and then override it for the first/last.If IE7-8 support is not needed you can use the :not() CSS selector.But if you need to support IE7+, which may still be the case there is a little trick you can use and usually gets you fairly far. A lesser known fact is that the :first-child psuedo selector actually works in IE7+ (not :last-child though) as are some other css selectors and this makes stuff like adding vertical margins in a horizontally floated layout possible.Imagine this html:And this as some CSS:So now all list items are horizontally next to each other, and now we want to add a margin in BETWEEN all items but not on the right or left side, we can do this in css:This usually covers 95% of the cases where I want something unique, then the rest of the 'forgotten' selectors cover another few percent, after that you need to add some classes which usually isn't much of a bottleneck anyway in the backend of the page.I would suggest to use first-of-type:Browser support (caniuse)

How to set an button align-right with Bootstrap?

[How to set an button align-right with Bootstrap?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/20462043/how-to-set-an-button-align-right-with-bootstrap)

I am learning Bootstrap. The structure is a container within some context. At the bottom of the container, I put a button next to an description.Now, I want to set the button align to the right without break the bootstrap structure.

What should I do? I had set the "float:right" to the button style, but it appeared bad.

The button is outside the "alert-info" background and not vertical align. Any better method?

Positioning absolute won't help, because the container div doesn't have measurements.This will do the trick:It uses display: table-cell; on the parent div, which by default has vertical-align: baseline; applied.  This changes the need for float: left; on the child divs and allows us to use display: inline-block;.  This also removes the need for your CSS clear fix.EDIT - Per @thirtydot's comments, adding vertical-align: bottom; to the child divs removes the gap at the bottom.Therefore, I changed CSS above and jsFiddle. I kept the display: table-cell; so that the parent div wraps the child divs with 0 padding and looks nice and snazzy!  FLEXBOX!

I've got a script executing on $(document).ready() that's supposed to vertically align block element in my layout. 90% of the time, it works without issue. However, for that extra 10% one of two things happens:Is there any reason why executing a script on DOM-ready would not have all the correct CSS values injected into the DOM yet? (all CSS is in the <head> via a <link>).Also, here's the script that's causing the issue (yes, it's been taken straight from here):Thanks.From the 1.3 release notes: From the ready(fn) documentation:Note that the above is not even about actually rendering the CSS, so you may still see the screen change when ready() kicks in. But it should save you from problems.Actually, I find it a bit strange that just putting the CSS above the JS will solve all issues. The CSS is loaded asynchronously, so JS loading can start and finish while the CSS is still being downloaded. So if the above is a solution, then executing any JS code is then halted until all earlier requests have completed?I did some testing, and indeed, sometimes JS is delayed until the CSS is loaded. I don't know why, because the waterfall shows that the JS has completed loading long before downloading the CSS has finished.See JS Bin for some HTML and its results (this has a 10 second delay), and see webpagetest.org for its waterfall results. This uses some script from Steve Souders' cuzillion.com to mimic slow responses. In the waterfall, the reference to resource.cgi is the CSS. So, in Internet Explorer, the first external JS starts to load right after the CSS was requested (but that CSS will take another 10 seconds to finish). But the second <script> tag is not executed until the CSS has finished loading as well:Another test with a second external JS after getting jQuery, shows that the download of the second JS is not started until the CSS has loaded. Here, the first reference to resource.cgi is the CSS, the second the JS:Moving the stylesheet below all JS indeed shows that the JS (including the ready function) runs much earlier, but even then the jQuery-applied class --which is yet unknown when the JS runs-- is used correctly in my quick tests in Safari and Firefox. But it makes sense that things like $(this).height() will yield wrong values at that time.However, additional testing shows that it is not a generic rule that JS is halted until earlier defined CSS is loaded. There seems to be some combination with using external JS and CSS. I don't know how this works.Last notes: as JS Bin includes Google Analytics in each script when running from the bare URL (like jsbin.com/aqeno, the test results are actually changed by JS Bin... It seems that the Output tab on the edit URL such as jsbin.com/aqeno/edit does not include the additional Google Analytics things, and surely yields different results, but that URL is hard to test using webpagetest.org. The reference to Stylesheets Block Downloads in Firefox and JavaScript Execution in IE as given by strager is a good start for a better understanding, but I got many questions left... Also note Steve Souders' IE8 Parallel Script Loading to make things even more complicated. (The waterfalls above are created using IE7.)Maybe one should simply believe the release notes and documentation...CSS/JavaScript/JQuery ordering doesn't work for me, but the following does:The DOM ready fires when all the DOM nodes are available. It has nothing to do with CSS. Try positioning the style before or try loading it differently.To the best of my knowledge the ready event is fired when the DOM is loaded - which means that all the blocking requests (i.e. JS) have loaded and the DOM tree is completely graphed. The ready state in IE relies on a slower event trigger (document.readyState change vs DOMContentLoaded) than most other browsers so the timing is browser dependant also.The existence of non-blocking requests (such as CSS and images) is completely asynchronous and unrelated to the ready state. If you are in a position where you require such resources you need to depend on the good old onload event.In molily's tests (2010),All modern browsers now support DOMContentLoaded (2017) so they may have standardized this behavior by now.

Modern desktop version of IE 10 is always fullscreen.There is a living specification for :fullscreen pseudo-class on W3But when I tried to detect fullscreen with jQuery version 1.9.x and 2.x:it threw this error:As you have discovered, browser compatibility is a big drawback. After all, this is something very new.However, since you're working in JavaScript, you have far more options available to you than if you were just using CSS.For example:You can also check for some slightly more loose comparisons:an event is fired when the browser changes full screen mode. You can use that to set a variable value, which you can check to determine if the browser is full screen or not.This will work on IE9+ and other modern browsersUsing "1" (instead of zero) because the system, at times, might just reserve a one pixel height for mouse interaction with some hidden or sliding command bars, in which case the fullscreen detection would fail. Use fullscreenchange event to detect a fullscreen change event, or if you don't want to handle vendor prefixes than you can also listen to the resize event (the window resize event that also triggers when fullscreen is entered or exited) and then check if document.fullscreenElement is not null to determine if fullscreen mode is on. You'll need to vendor prefix fullscreenElement accordingly. I would use something like this:https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dn312066(v=vs.85).aspx has a good example for this which I quote below:It is working in IE 8 and I am writing a specific web page for IE 8. I do not need to check if the other browsers support this or not.Try this! Works for recent browsers.You can also use this jquery plugin for same.Here is another solution which works in IE 11:});Did you try $(window) instead of $(document). Follow one example http://webification.com/tag/detect-fullscreen-jquery.Here's another solution that might work for you:I prefer to use width since it will help work around tabs and developer info at the bottom.I worked out a good way of doing this:Then set the body default width to:In Safari on iPhone, webkitDisplayingFullscreen property will return true if <video> is playing in fullscreen. Ref: https://developer.apple.com/documentation/webkitjs/htmlvideoelement/1630493-webkitdisplayingfullscreenReading MDN Web docs, I like this native method.https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/DocumentOrShadowRoot/fullscreenElementor fancierThis method also works when you open developer tools in browser.

Because fullscreen is applied to a particular element, null means none of it is in fullscreen.You can even extend to check a particular element eg:Which only return true if currently is fullscreen and (element is null or element is the fullscreened element)

Is there a way to detect if a handheld browser is used (iOS/Android phone/tablet)?I tried this with the goal to make an element half as wide in a browser on a handheld device but it doesn't make a difference.Can it be done and if so how?edit: From the referred page in jmaes' answer I used@media only screen and (max-device-width: 480px).Update (June 2016): I now try to support touch and mouse input on every resolution, since the device landscape is slowly blurring the lines between what things are and aren't touch devices. iPad Pros are touch-only with the resolution of a 13" laptop. Windows laptops now frequently come with touch screens.Other similar SO answers (see other answer on this question) might have different ways to try to figure out what sort of device the user is using, but none of them are fool-proof. I encourage you to check those answers out if you absolutely need to try to determine the device.iPhones, for one, ignore the handheld query (Source). And I wouldn't be surprised if other smartphones do, too, for similar reasons.The current best way that I use to detect a mobile device is to know its width and use the corresponding media query to catch it. That link there lists some popular ones. A quick Google search would yield you any others you might need, I'm sure.For more iPhone-specific ones (such as Retina display), check out that first link I posted.Here's how I did it:Based on https://stackoverflow.com/a/42835826/1365066Detecting mobile devicesRelated answer: https://stackoverflow.com/a/13805337/1306809There's no single approach that's truly foolproof. The best bet is to mix and match a variety of tricks as needed, to increase the chances of successfully detecting a wider range of handheld devices. See the link above for a few different options.Don't detect mobile devices, go for stationary ones instead.Nowadays (2016) there is a way to detect dots per inch/cm/px that seems to work in most modern browsers (see http://caniuse.com/#feat=css-media-resolution). I needed a method to distinguish between a relatively small screen, orientation didn't matter, and a stationary computer monitor.Because many mobile browsers don't support this, one can write the general css code for all cases and use this exception for large screens:Both Windows XP and 7 have the default setting of 1 dot per pixel (or 96dpi). I don't know about other operating systems, but this works really well for my needs.Edit: dppx doesn't seem to work in Internet Explorer.. use (96)dpi instead.I believe that a much more reliable way to detect mobile devices is to look at the navigator.userAgent string.  For example, on my iPhone the user agent string is:Note that this string contains two telltale keywords: iPhone and Mobile.  Other user agent strings for devices that I don't have are provided at:https://deviceatlas.com/blog/list-of-user-agent-stringsUsing this string, I set a JavaScript Boolean variable bMobile on my website to either true or false using the following code:I know this is an old thread but I thought this might help someone:Mobile devices have greater height than width, in contrary, computers have greater width than height. For example:so that would have to be done for every width i guess.

When I inspect the body element it does NOT include this space. When I inspect the html element is does include this space. Also if I delete the white space goes away.Here is my main layoutAdd a css reset to the top of your website style sheet, different browsers render some default margin and padding and perhaps external style sheets do something you are not aware of too, a css reset will just initialize a fresh palette so to speak:UPDATE: Use the Universal Selector Instead:

@Frank mentioned that you can use the Universal Selector: * instead of listing all the elements, and this selector looks like it is cross browser compatible in all major browsers:Aside from the css reset, I also added the following to the css of my div container and that fixed it. Try thisOld question, but I just ran into this.  Sometimes your files are UTF-8 with a BOM at the start, and your template engine doesn't like that.  So when you include your template, you get another (invisible) BOM inserted into your page...This causes a gap at the start of your page, where the browser renders the BOM, but it looks invisible to you (and in the inspector, just shows up as whitespace/quotes.Save your template files as UTF-8 without BOM, or change your template engine to correctly handle UTF8/BOM documents.If nothing of the above helps, check if there is margin-top set on some of the (some levels below) nested DOM element(s).It will be not recognizable when you inspect body element itself in the debugger. It will only be visible when you unfold several elements nested down in body element in Chrome Dev Tools elements debugger and check if there is one of them with margin-top set.The below is the upper part of a site screen shot and the corresponding Chrome Dev Tools view when you inspect body tag. No sign of top margin here and you have resetted all the browser-scpecific CSS properties as per answers above but that unwanted white space is still here.

The following is a view when you inspect the right nested element. It is clearly seen the orange'ish top-margin is set on it. This is the one that causes the white space on top of body element.

On that found element replace margin-top with padding-top if you need space above it and yet not to leak it above the body tag.Hope that helps :)There could be many reasons that you are getting white space as mentioned above. 

Suppose if you have empty div element with HTML Entities also cause the error. 

Example Remove HTML EntitiesCheck for any webkit styles being applied to elements like ul, h4 etc. For me it was margin-before and after causing this.Using overflow: auto on the <body> tag is a cleaner solution and will work a charm.I Just put CSS in my <div> now working in code

Therefore, the table isn't inline with anything else. So it looks like the table has some padding.I can't seem to find a solution.Here is an example of the issueHad the same problem, the border spacing property was adding space around the table as well, and to my knowledge, there wasn’t anyway to limit it to only ‘the inside’, so I used transparent borders instead:This sets ‘border spacing’ as normal, except that there’s ‘unwanted’ spacing at the top and left of the table.Selects the first column.Selects the td elements of the first row (assuming that the top of the table starts with a tr element, change accordingly for th).I found a way to do this with negative margins and improves on Steven's answer in that it lets you make the table take up 100% even if it doesn't have enough content. The solution is to make the table width 100% and use a negative margin on a containing element:See it as a jsFiddleI optimized the solution with transparent border so it has no more obliquely cut inner borders.1) let table fill horizontal and collapse the borders:2) Set all borders of table cells to width 0 and prevent background is drawn below the border.3) Set inner space with transparent border but not to first row and column.here is a jsbinSimilar to what Steven Vachon said, negative margin may be your best bet.Alternatively, you can use calc() to fix the problem.CSS:Just add whatever margin you take off or the width will be too narrow (100% isn't wide enough).Use negative margins and a container with positive padding.Just make sure that you have substantial content for it to stretch the table to 100% width, or else it'll be 20px too narrow.More info: svachon.com/blog/inside-only-css-table-border-spacing/use margin-left: -10px; to remove left padding but in the right there will be 20px padding.

Below is a jsFiddle I made to play around with this idea; feel free to fork it if you know of a solution.jsFiddle - http://jsfiddle.net/skoshy/dLdFZ/Create another CSS animation called fadeOut, say. Then when you want to remove the element, change the animation property on the element to that new animation, and use the animationend event to trigger the actual removal of the element once the animation is done:See also my updated version of your jsFiddle. That works for me in Safari, at least.Well, you should be using a class instead of that .css().I don't think jQuery has any "real" support for CSS animations yet, so I don't think you can get rid of that webkitAnimationEnd. In Firefox it's just called animationend.I'm pretty sure there's no way to do this in just CSS.I've been working on a component library for javascript and I ran into this problem myself. I have the benefit of being able to throw a ton of javascript at the problem, but since you're already using a bit, consider the following for a gracefully degrading solution: On removal of any component/dom node, add a class called 'removing'.Then in the css you can define your animation using that class:And back in the javascript, just after you add the 'removing' class, you should be able to check for the 'animation' css property, and if it exists, then you know that you can hook on 'animationEnd' and if it doesn't, then just remove the element right away. I remember testing this a while back, it should work; I'll see if I can dig up the example code.Update: 

I've dug up this technique and started writing a really cool plugin for jQuery that allows you to use CSS3 animations for DOM elements that are being removed. No additional Javascript required: http://www.github.com/arthur5005/jquery.motionnotionIt's very experimental, use at your own risk, but would love some help and feedback. :)ideally for something like fadeIN and fadeOUT you should be using css transitions not css animations..

tabindex in CSS

[tabindex in CSS](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4971912/tabindex-in-css)

Is it possible to control tabindex with CSS and if yes, which browsers support it and on which elements?EDITI should say, my goal is to catch keydown events on a div. I saw this page http://www.quirksmode.org/js/events/keys.html# that tests keyboard events and it shows that the only way keydown fires on anything other than document and body or some kind of form element or link is to have tabindex declared on it. But I read on W3C site:So I am a little confused, what to do in order to be standarts compliant and make my use case work?EDIT2My whole use case is a div with a lot of content with an artificial scroll bar.

I am able to scroll it with mouse events but no luck with the keyboard so far.Update 2017As pointed out by @Wallop in the comments, the nav-index property was dropped from the spec in 2015 due to "lack of implementation interest".Take a look at the nav-index property introduced by W3C in CSS3-UI.This property has exactly the same behavior as a tabindex and is applicable to any element.Being probably the best standards-compliant solution for the use case, nav-index is interpreted only by Opera so far (as of June 2012) and is also marked as "Feature at risk" by W3C, therefore may be dropped any time.Alternative cross-browser solutions are:With respect to BoltClock´s point, I agree that the tabbing order is very logical (both the text selection order and tabbing order are closely related to the sequence in which elements are aranged in the document). On the other hand, CSS has a wider purpose today. It can manipulate not just the content of a document (content property) but also the behavior when and if events are to be fired: i.e. using pointer-events, display or z-index the pointer event's order will change. If these are very basic CSS properties, why you should not be able to influence KeyBoardEvents, too?This is a bit old but now there are css options like -moz-user-focus. I'm sure there is a webkit equivalent.https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/CSS/-moz-user-focususer-focus is the standard cross browser attribute.

This can be achieved using many plugins for jQuery, but I'll explain you on one example, which is called as jQuery withinviewportLink to source and documentation on: [ withInViewport - Github ]Download plugins and include jQuery framework and withinviewport plugin in your script:.Initialise function on scroll event:.Use withinviewport selector to get all elements in you Viewport and by each element add class to corresponding list-item in your #timeline container:Put all together:..Also this plugin gives you opportunity to set top, bottom, left and right offset for view-port.See demo here: http://patik.com/code/within-viewport/

jQuery changing css class to div

If I have one div element for example  and class 'first' is defined with many css properties. Can I assign css class 'second' which also has many properties differently defined to this same div just on some event without writing each property in line.If you'd like to add it on an event, you can do so easily as well. An example with the click event:Yep, easily.You can add and remove classes with jQuery like so:By the way you can set multiple classes in your markup right away separated with a whitespaceThis may not be exactly on target because I am not completely clear on what you want to do. However, assuming you mean you want to assign a different class to a div in response to an event, the answer is yes, you can certainly do this with jQuery. I am only a jQuery beginner, but I have used the following in my code:If you wanted to replace the first class with the second class, I believe you would use removeClass first and then addClass as I did above. toggleClass may also be worth a look. The jQuery documentation is well written for these type of changes, with examples.Someone else my have a better option, but I hope that helps!An HTML element like div can have more than one classes. Let say div is assigned two styles using addClass method. If style1 has 3 properties like font-size, weight and color, and style2 has 4 properties like font-size, weight, color and background-color, the resultant effective properties set (style), i think, will have 4 properties i.e. union of all style sets. Common properties, in our case, color,font-size, weight, will have one occuerance with latest values. If div is assigned style1 first and style2 second, the common prpoerties will be overwritten by style2 values. Further, I have written a post at Using JQuery to Apply,Remove and Manage Styles, I hope it will help youRegards

CSS3 height: calc(100%) not working

[CSS3 height: calc(100%) not working](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/16164736/css3-height-calc100-not-working)

I have a div that I want to fill the whole height of the body less a set number in pixels. But I can't get height: calc(100% - 50px) to work. (The reason I want to do this is I have elements that have dynamic heights based on some varying criteria, e.g. height of the header changes based on different elements it can contain. A content div then needs to stretch to fill the rest of the available space available.)The div element however stays the height of the content - it doesn't seem as if it interprets 100% to be the height of the body element.HTML:CSS:See fiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/ElizabethMeyer/UF3mb/.I would appreciate any help or pointers in the right direction.

IE9+, Firefox 16+ and with vendor prefix Firefox 4+, Chrome 19+, Safari 6+First off - check with Firebug(or what ever your preference is) whether the css property is being interpreted by the browser.  Sometimes the tool used will give you the problem right there, so no more hunting.Second off - check compatibility: http://caniuse.com/#feat=calcAnd third - I ran into some problems a few hours ago and just resolved it.  It's the smallest thing but it kept me busy for 30 minutes.Here's how my CSS looked Looks right doesn't it?

WRONG

Here's how it should look:Looks the same right?Notice the spaces!!!

Checked android browser, Firefox for android, Chrome for android, Chrome and Firefox for Windows and Internet Explorer 11.  All of them ignored the CSS if there were no spaces.Hope this helps someone.I was searching why % doesn't seem to work. So, I tested out using 100vh instead of just setting it at 100% it seems that 100vh works really well across almost all browsers/devices. example: you want to only display the top div to the user before it scrolls, like a hero banner module. But, at the top of the page is a navbar which is 68px in height. The following doesn't work for me at all doing just %  There's was no change. The page just stayed the same. However, when swapping this to "vh" instead it works great! The div block you assign it too will stay on the viewer's device hight only. Until they decide to scroll down the page.Change the +/- to include how big your header is on the top. 

If your navbar is say 120px in height then change 68px to 120px.Hope this helps anyone who cannot get this working with using normal height: calc();  try setting both html and body to height 100%;All the parent elements in the hierarchy should have height 100%. Just give max-height:100% to the element and max-height:calc(100% - 90px) to the immediate parent element. It worked for me on IE also.The Rendering in IE fails due to failure of Calc when the window is resized or data loaded in DOM. But this method mentioned above worked for me even in IE.You don't need to calculate anything, and probably shouldn't:I stuck it all together for brevity.If you are styling calc in a GWT project, its parser might not parse calc for you as it did not for me... the solution is to wrap it in a css literal like this:

The things that have failed (in no particular order):What am I missing? I doubt it matters, but I'm using AngularJS. Thought I'd mention it in case there is a known conflict between Angular & Pseudo selectors (which I doubt).

Thanks.The issue is your use of absolute positioning & the method you're using to try and center it. If you position an element absolutely, the ol' margin: 0 auto; method won't work to center the thing. I point you to an explanation as to why this is at the end of the question, but in case you just want this to work let's get to the solution first.Here's some working code. View it on JSFiddleLet's break down what's going on here.In your original Fiddle, the pseudoelement is positioned absolutely relative to the viewport. An example might be the best way to show what this means, and why we don't want this. Consider setting it to top: 0. This would keep it latched to the top of the browser window (or, in this case, the JSFiddle frame), rather than the parent (the li). So, if our menu happened to be at the bottom of the page, or even moving around, the pseudoelement would be floating independent from it, stuck to the top of the page.This is the default behavior of an absolutely positioned element when you don't explicitly set the position on any parent elements. What we want is to have its position defined relative to the parent. If we do this then the pseudoelement sticks with the parent, no matter where it happens to be.To make this happen, you need to set the parent, #tool-menu li, to be explicitly positioned (which means setting it to be anything other than position: static). If you choose to use position: relative;, it won't change the computed location of the parent on the page, and does the thing we want. So that's why I used that one.In technical terms, what we're doing here is creating a new containing block for the child.Now that our absolute positioning will be determined in relation to the parent, we can take advantage of the fact that we can use percentages to define where to place the child. In this case, you want it centered, so I set it be left: 50%.If you do just this, though, you'll see that this lines up the left edge of the pseudoelement at 50%. This isn't what we want – we want the center of the pseudoelement to be at the middle. And that's why I added the negative margin-left. This scoots it over a bit to line the middle up with the center of the parent.And once we do that, it's centered! Brilliance!The auto value of a margin is calculated from a fairly complex algorithm. At times, it computes to 0. I know from experience that this is one such instance of that happening, though I haven't yet traced my way through the algorithm to see exactly why. If you'd like to run through it, take a look at the spec most browsers have most likely implemented.You can also use the calc function in css to center the pseudo element.Note: This isn't supported in IE8 and below (caniuse) but you can provide a fallback for older browsers. View it on this code pen. I'm also using MarkP's css border method to draw the triangle.Not directly related (have already voted up jmeas) but you may also find it easier to use the CSS border trick to make the triangle. e.g. Similar tactics as to what jmeas has suggested with regards to the vertical positioning.  We align to the bottom and then use a negative margin-bottom to push this out to the desired location.Wouldn't be better to just define the width as a percentage, make it a block element and text-align it in the center? "float: center;" is invalid, and won't work. Mixing floated and absolute positioned elements are a sure way to get trouble with your layout as they don't really work that well togheter.Try something like this:As long as the element has a width declared you can use the absolute centering  method.To use this method the right and left properties must be set to 0 for margin: auto to be effective.This method can be expanded to implement horizontal centering as well. see link for full info:http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2013/08/09/absolute-horizontal-vertical-centering-css/ With pesudo element :after or :before use display: inline-block;Try something like this:

For example the padding for "navbar fixed" need to be set to html and not to body (how it is described in bootstrap doc).alternative with wrapperIf you do not like set overflow:hidden on html (some people don´t want this, but it works, is valid and 100% standard compliant), you can wrap the content of body in an extra div.Than you do not need extra care for fixed elements, you can use it like before.here is an example: http://jsbin.com/oHiPIJi/47/Update:Issues in Bootstrap:Update 2: FYIIn Bootstrap 3.2.0 they add a workaround to modal.js that try to handle the issues with Javascript for every invoke of modal.prototype.show(), Modal.prototype.hide() and Modal.prototype.resize(). They add 7 (!) new methods for that. Now ca. 20% of code from modal.js only try to handle that issues.Try this:It is actually caused by the following rule in bootstrap.css:I am not exactly sure why it behaves like that (perhaps to account for scrollbar somehow) but you can change the behaviour with this:EDIT: Actually, this is a reported issue in bootstrap: https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/issues/9855When the model opens, a padding of 17px to the right of the body. The code below should resolve that issue.    Here's the fix proposed by user yshing that really FIXED it for me while using Bootstrap v3.1.1 and Google Chrome 35.0.1916.114m. The fix comes from a GitHub issue thread regarding this matter:The fix will land only in Bootstrap 3.2 as desbribed by mdo.To prevent the page from shifting in similar instances - for example an accordion opening that goes past the bottom of the page - I add this in CSS:The overflow-y: scroll forces the scrollbar to present at all times. To be honest, I can't remember why I put height:100% in there... but you don't seem to require it for this problem.Demo: http://jsfiddle.net/jxX6A/8/There is still a little movement. But that seems to be present on Bootstrap's own example page: http://getbootstrap.com/javascript/#modalsSo I'm guessing you're stuck with it... but it's still far better than what you were seeing initially.EDIT: I might be concerned that adding these styles would interfere with other Bootstrap stuff, as I haven't used it myself, so you might want to double check on that.You just edit .modal-open class form bootstrap.min.css file, I thin it's will be ok         .modal-open{overflow:auto}The over-flow:hidden is set there , you just set over-flow:auto .i have faced same problem and following solutionA lot has changed since bootstrap 3.3.6 so the solutions above may not suffice.To solve this, look at the setScrollbar function in bootstrap.js (or bootstrap-min.js of course), you will immediately notice that bootstrap is adding padding-right to the body element setting its value to a worked out value of scrollbarWidth plus existing padding-right on the body (or 0 if not).If you comment out the belowIn your css override bootstrap modal-open class with the belowFolks have suggested overflow-y: scroll; the problem with this is that your content shifts if scroll bar does not exists in the first place.NB

As per http://getbootstrap.com/javascript/#modals, always try to place a modal's HTML code in a top-level position in your documentI have same problem and I got solution that is work for me....place this code at top of your style.css fileFound this answer in TB issues just by adding this below css that small movement will be fixedCredits to https://github.com/tvararuI use Bootstrap v3.3.4 and see this problem, I understood that Bootstrap modal add 17px padding right to the body, so just simply use following code:No solution here fixed my issue. But following Css I got from Github worked for me.Just do this simply and thats allWorks for me. Short and does the job.This is a reported issue to bootstrap: https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/issues/9855And this is my temporary quick fix and it's work using fixed top navbar, only using javascript. Load this script along with your page.Here is the working example: http://jsbin.com/oHiPIJi/64i have faced same problem and following solution works for meTry to change all occurence of below withon your bootstrap.js file.That's All..Simply add a class it worked for me I fixed my problem and I think it will work for everyone.

In bootstrap.js there's a line:if (this.bodyIsOverflowing) this.$body.css('padding-right', bodyPad + this.scrollbarWidth)It means in some case Bootstrap will add a padding-right of scrollbar width while opening a modal. So @pmanOnu was half way right, but don't delete this whole line of code but only replace bodyPad + this.scrollbarWidth in bootstrap.js with 0to make Bootstrap adding a padding-right of 0px (which is the same of not adding).Then add .modal-open {overflow: initial;} to your custom css to prevent Bootstrap from disabling scrollbar while opening modals.If all the above solutions didn't work , it may be because of positioning the content ,Just take a look at the position of the modal So it turns out I was actually getting right margin of 250px or so.  My problem seemed to be that .modal-open was getting set to position: fixed, and that was the cause for whatever reason.  So in my case, the fix was similar, but I set the position value to the default as below:For anyone still struggling with this - the latest version of Bootstrap has a native fix. Just update the bootstrap.min.css and bootstrap.min.js files from the latest version.http://getbootstrap.com/I really didn't like any of the solutions provided, and used a combination of them (along with a fix I previously had for qTip modals) to come up with something that worked best for me with Bootstrap v3.3.7.UPDATE:  Resolved issue with fixed navbar positioning on iOS.CSS:JavaScript:This allows the background to be "fixed" yet still allows the modals to be scrollable, resolves the issue of double scrollbar and the repositioning of the fixed navbar.Note that there is additional code there as well to remember the 'scroll' position (and return to it) when the modal is closed.Hope this helps anyone else looking to achieve what I was going after. I found the answer by Agni Pradharma working for me; however not entirely in Chrome.It appears the document scrollbar is wider than another elements scrollbar; so I edited the getScrollBarWidth function.It simply first checks the width; removes the document scrollbar; then compares the difference. It also happens to be much less code.Here's what I used, will work 100% in Bootstrap 3.2.0 as long as you don't mind forcing scrollbars.the best way is:

to add to BODY overflow-y: scrolland remove 4 function from bootstrap.js -For me it works fine like thisFor me the following seems to work - tested in Firefox and Chrome on Linux:This worked for me. Overrides the 17px padding added to the right of the body:    I tweaked this answer further up this thread by TBAGWith a minor tweak it works on the desktop, for mobile devices overflow is set to hiddenfinal codeHope this helps!

suppose you want to apply multiple borders on one div then code is like:You can use outline with outline offset Try below structure for applying two color border,You can use the border and box-shadow properties along with CSS pseudo elements to achieve a triple-border sort of effect. See the example below for an idea of how to create three borders at the bottom of a div:You'll have to play around with the values to get the alignment correct. However, you can also achieve more flexibility, e.g. 4 borders if you put some of the attributes in the proper element rather than the pseudo selector.

It seems I can't just set a width because those headlines with longer content then shorter content makes it break.How can I simply make width stretch/change depending on the length of content there is? Any help would be greatly appreciated.As far as I know, display: inline-block is what you probably need. That will make it seem like it's sort of inline but still allow you to use things like margins and such.If you are coming here, there is high chance width: min-content or width: max-content can fix your problem. This can force an element to use the smallest or largest space the browser could choose…This is the modern solution. Here is a small tutorial for that.There is also fit-content, which often works like min-content, but is more flexible. (But also has worse browser support.) This is a quite new feature and some browsers do not support it yet, but browser support is growing. See the current browser status here.If display: inline; isn't working, try out display: inline-block;. :)h2 { display: inline }The best way to do this is to set display: inline;. Note, however, that in inline display, you lose access to some layout properties, such as manual height and vertical margins, but this doesn't appear to be a problem for your page.try to use position: absolute;

Why doesn't「margin: auto」center an element vertically?

[Why doesn't「margin: auto」center an element vertically?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/34552116/why-doesnt-margin-auto-center-an-element-vertically)

As you can see in the demo below, margin: auto; centers the blue div horizontally, but not vertically. Why not?My question is not asking for workarounds.

2015-12-31 22:30:29Z

As you can see in the demo below, margin: auto; centers the blue div horizontally, but not vertically. Why not?My question is not asking for workarounds.As mentioned, this behavior is specified in section 10.6.2 of CSS2.1, and has remained unchanged from CSS2.Block boxes are stacked vertically from top to bottom in normal flow. Furthermore, vertical margins may collapse, and only do so under certain circumstances (in your demo, the border on the parent element will prevent any margins on the child element from collapsing with its own). If you only have one such block box, and the height of the containing block is auto, then its top and bottom margins will be zero anyway. But if you have more than one block box in the same flow, or even out-of-flow boxes affecting the layout of in-flow boxes (in the case of clearance for example), how would you expect auto margins to resolve for those in-flow boxes?This is why auto left and right margins are likewise zeroed out for inline elements (including atomic inlines) and floats (though horizontal margins never collapse). Inline-level boxes are laid along line boxes, and floats too obey unique layout rules.Absolutely positioned boxes are a different story: since they are never aware of any other boxes in the same positioning context as themselves, auto top and bottom margins can be calculated for them with respect to their containing blocks without having to worry about any other boxes ever interfering.Flexbox is also a different story: what sets flex layout apart from block layout is that flex items are by definition always aware of other flex items in the same flex formatting context, including the fact that there are none. In particular, neither can floats intrude into the flex container, nor can you float flex items to subvert this (although you can still remove a child element from flex layout completely with absolute positioning). Margins behave very differently with flex items due in part to this. See sections 4.2, 9.5 and 9.6.Why...because the W3C spec says so.As to the actual "why"...the query should really be addressed there.It doesn't center the element vertically because it is a block-level element in the normal flow. Thus, the following rule applies:It's also worth pointing out that the rule above also applies to the following elements as well: (see points 10.6.2 and 10.6.3 for more information and conditions).With that being said, absolutely positioned, non-replaced elements that don't have top, height, and bottom values of auto are an exception to this rule. The following applies from point 10.6.4:See the example below demonstrating how an absolutely positioned element is vertically centered using margin: auto. It works because none of the three properties top, height, and bottom have a value of auto:In addition, it's probably worth pointing out the following rule as well:This means that if the absolutely positioned element has a margin-top value of auto and a margin-bottom value of 0 (i.e., margin: auto auto 0), the element would be absolutely positioned at the bottom relative to the parent like in the example below:Actually, it does – just not for every display value. If display is flex, margin: auto centers both vertically and horizontally.The same applies to display: inline-flex, display: grid and display: inline-grid. It's because of the actual possibility of knowing the true height of the element in which you want to center vertically in. To understand that, first think about how auto horizontal centering works. You have a div which you've given it a width (fixed or percentage). The width can be calculated to certain degree. If it's fixed width, great. If it's flexible or responsive (percentage) at least you have a range that the width will cover before it hits the next breakpoint. You take that width, minus whatever it's inside and split the remainder on both sides.Now, with that information, how could the browser calculate the infinite amount of variations in which your div will grow vertically? Keep in mind the size of the element, wrapping of text, paddings, and responsiveness will also alter the width and force the text to wrap further, and on, and on it goes. Is it an impossible task? Not really, has CSS spent time and effort covering this? Not worth their time, I guess. And that is basically the answer I tell my students. But....fret not! Bootstrap v4 alpha has figured out vertical centering! EDITSorry to edit this late but I thought you may want to consider this solutions to center vertically and it is pretty simple by making use of the calc function See it HERE

Why is part of square displayed?Tested browsers:This is not a bug and is actually how it's supposed to work. It's a bit confusing as the elaborate description of Stacking Contexts doesn't mention anything about it. However, the visual formatting module links to the color module where this particular gotcha can be found (emphasis mine):It's not a problem of opacity being more important than z-index, rather than z-index being relative to their stacking context (see z-index in the CSS2 specification).In other words, z-index are only significant within the context of a positioned ancestor (whether its relative, absolute or fixed). What you need to do to fix your problem is add a position: relative; to the element that contain both your popup and your navy square, and probably add it a z-index: 1; . Seeing your screenshot it will probably be a top element such as a wrapper div.Workaround for two elements, like divs: add a 0.99 opacity to your top element, and the order of both is reestablished.Example code might be needed to debug this problem.You might put overflow: hidden and possibly position: relative in a DIV which surrounds all the editor objects to try to force the elements to only be drawn within that DIV, e.g:As a last resort, you could also try a iframe in between the two elements to try to stop them seeping through.You might try to set the popup window's DIV like this using !important so the style doesn't change on applying new style or class:Then, make new CSS class:And add class to all elements in the window, like this for example:My guess is that this would work, since there is no priority in applying CSS attributes... as far as I know. =)I had the same issue. Using rgba instead of color/opacity solved my problem. Working with LESS (in the Bootstrap framework), the fade() function did the conversion for me.Although @Guillaume Esquevin already gave a great answer, I will try to expand on it in case someone ignores what a stacking context is (like I did).As you can read here, there is something called stacking context, which refers to a group of elements sharing a parent that move together in the stack. An example could be a div and all its children.There are three ways to create a stacking context: in the root of the document (the html element), by positioning the parent element, and by changing the opacity of the parent to something lower than 1.Then, if you have a div with opacity lower than 1 and you want some sibling element of this div to appear behind it (and its children), you can create a new stacking context on such sibling by setting its position to relative or by changing its opacity as well.

Is there any way to use CSS to blur the background of a semitransparent element instead of its contents?OCT. 2016 UPDATESince the -moz-element() property doesn't seem to be widely supported by other browsers except to FF, there's an even easier technique to apply blurring without affecting the contents of the container. The use of pseudoelements is ideal in this case in combination with svg blur filter.Check the demo using pseudo-element(Demo was tested in FF v49, Chrome v53, Opera 40 - IE doesn't seem to support blur either with css or svg filter)The only way (so far) of having a blur effect in the background without js plugins, is the use of -moz-element() property in combination with the svg blur filter. With -moz-element() you can define an element as a background image of another element. Then you apply the svg blur filter. OPTIONAL: You can utilize some jQuery for scrolling if your background is in fixed position.See my demo hereI understand it is a quite complicated solution and limited to FF (element() applies only to Mozilla at the moment with -moz-element() property) but at least there's been some effort in the past to implement in webkit browsers and hopefully it will be implemented in the future.In recent versions of major browsers you can use backdrop-filter property.HTMLCSSor if you need different background color for browsers without support:Demo: JSFiddleDocs: Mozilla Developer: backdrop-filterIs it for me?: CanIUseYou can use a pseudo-element to position as the background of the content with the same image as the background, but blurred with the new CSS3 filter.You can see it in action here: http://codepen.io/jiserra/pen/JzKpxI made that for customizing a select, but I added the blur background effect.There is a simple and very common technique by using 2 background images: a crisp and a blurry one. You set the crisp image as a background for the body and the blurry one as a background image for your container. The blurry image must be set to fixed positioning and the alignment is 100% perfect. I used it before and it works.You can see a working example at the following fiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/jTUjT/5/. Try to resize the browser and see that the alignment never fails.If only CSS element() was supported by other browsers other than Mozilla's -moz-element() you could create great effects. See this demo with Mozilla.Use an empty element sized for the content as the background, and position the content over the blurred element.The background element can be inside of the content element, but not the other way around.This is not easy if the content is not always consistently sized, but it works.You could make it through iframes... I made something, but my only problem for now is syncing those divs to scroll simultaneous... its terrible way, because its like you load 2 websites, but the only way I found... you could also work with divs and overflow I guess...In which way do you want it dynamic? If you want the popup to successfully map to the background, you need to create two backgrounds. It requires both the use of element() or -moz-element() and a filter (for Firefox, use a SVG filter like filter: url(#svgBlur) since Firefox does not support -moz-filter: blur() as yet?). It only works in Firefox at the time of writing.See demo here.I still need to create a simple demo to show how it is done. You're welcome to view the source.

What is the difference between px, em and ex? And when you define font-size in CSS, do you use px, pt or em?

2010-03-05 09:59:18Z

What is the difference between px, em and ex? And when you define font-size in CSS, do you use px, pt or em?http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/syndata.html#length-units describes those and the other length units available in CSSAs a rule of thumb, use percentages on screen and pt for print.CSS Length Units:Points are standard typographical measurements that have been used by printers and typesetters for decades and by word-processing programs for many years. Traditionally, there are 72 points to an inch (points were defined before widespread use of the metric system). Therefore, the capital letters of text set to 12 points should be one-sixth of an inch tall. For example, p {font-size: 18pt;} is equivalent to p {font-size: 0.25in;}.Picas are another typographical term. A pica is equivalent to 12 points, which means there are 6 picas to an inch. As just shown, the capital letters of text set to 1 pica should be one-sixth of an inch tall. For example, p {font-size: 1.5pc;} would set text to the same size as the example declarations found in the definition of points.These units are really useful only if the browser knows all the details of the monitor on which your page is displayed, the printer you're using, or whatever other user agent might apply. On a web browser, display is affected by the size of the monitor and the resolution to which the monitor is setand there isn't much that you, as the author, can do about these factors. absolute units are much more useful in defining style sheets for printed documents, where measuring things in terms of inches, points, and picas is common. As you've seen, attempting to use absolute measurements in web design is perilous at best.em: one "em" is defined to be the value of font-size for a given font. If the font-size of an element is 14 pixels, then for that element, 1em is equal to 14 pixels.ex: refers to the height of a lowercase x in the font being used. Therefore, if you have two paragraphs in which the text is 24 points in size, but each paragraph uses a different font, then the value of ex could be different for each paragraph. This is because different fonts have different heights for x px: tiny boxes of color in a monitor are pixels. In general, if you declare something like font-size: 18px, a web browser will almost certainly use actual pixels on your monitor after all, they're already there but with other display devices, like printers, the user agent will have to rescale pixel lengths to something more sensible. In other words, the printing code has to figure out how many dots there are in a pixel, and to do so, it may use the 96ppi reference pixel.ConclutionBecause of this potential for rescaling, pixels are defined as a relative unit of measurement, even though, in web design, they behave much like absolute units.Rrefrence: css the definite guid by eric meyer em : The em is a scalable unit that is used in web document media. An em is equal to the current font-size, for instance, if the font-size of the document is 12pt, 1em is equal to 12pt.px : Pixels are fixed-size units that are used in screen media (i.e. to be read on the computer screen). One pixel is equal to one dot on the computer screen (the smallest division of your screen’s resolution). pt : Points are traditionally used in print media (anything that is to be printed on paper, etc.). One point is equal to 1/72 of an inch. Points are much like pixels, in that they are fixed-size units and cannot scale in size.

The showSubmenu function is simple - it just positions the submenu and shows it.You then need to make sure the submenu is visible while your cursor is on it and disappears when you leave (this should be in your document.ready function.Also don't forget to hide your submenus to start with - in the document.ready functionSee the full code herehttp://jsfiddle.net/R4nyn/I'm new to stackoverflow, so please be nice :)

however turning to the problem of horizontal jQuery ui menu, the only way I could manage to resolve the problem (refering to this) was to set:I know this is an old thread but I was digging into the jQuery UI source code and built upon Rowan's answer which

visiable without messing with design (height) and also alowing menu to appear vertical below the parent item.In the jquery-ui.js do a search to find $.widget( "ui.menu") and change postition to: And in your css add: End Result will be a jQuery UI Menu horizontal with sub menus being displayed veriticaly below the parent menu item.changing:to:should start you off.The best option I found is a plugin called jMenu.Main:  http://www.myjqueryplugins.com/jquery-plugin/jmenu

GitHub:  https://github.com/alpixel/jMenuScreenshot:

To get a horizontal nav bar with vertical dropdowns, use a combination of a table and unordered lists. The level 1 items are represented by table cells, subsequent levels are represented by unordered lists.The positioning of the child menus was a problem. The default is to have them appear directly alongside, but when on a top level item, that was obscuring the subsequent items in the horizontal nav bar. Having them appear below was ok for a single dropdown menu, but if there was a second level beneath, then that 2nd level would obscure the rest of the first. The solution is to have the menu open below and somewhat to the right, see the "position" option in the menu invocation.

The following style is just an example of how to set transitions in CSS3.

You can use JS to create and position it, which shouldn't be terribly difficult if you're using a fairly modern framework.you might want to try this. Seems to be pretty easy and works on IE6 and Moz atleast.The general syntax is :

2008-11-18 02:28:13Z

Is there a good cross-browser way to set a max-height property of a DIV and when that DIV goes beyond the max-height, it turns into an overflow with scrollbars?Sadly IE6 doesn't so you have to use an expression for IE6, then set the max-height for all other browsers:Overflow:auto would most likely work in most cases for have any extra spill over.I found this solution from a post made in 2005 (Min-Height Fast hack). It's a hack but it's simple and pure CSS:The example is for max-height, but it works for min-height, min-width and max-width. :)*Note: You must use absolute values, percentages don't work.All you need now is the "overflow:scroll;" to make this work with scroll barsCould you have a wrapper div with the height set as your height and overflow: scrolling.  Then the inner div has no height set and as it grows it will fill then use the scrollbars of the first div?Major hack (RedWolves-style):I was getting no love from the max-height attribute so I had this alreadyand succeeded with these 2 classes.  But it's ugly so in searching for better hit this question. divMax having position:absolute lets content underneath show through but controls the ultimate height of divInner to 200px.I found this from http://www.tutorialspoint.com/css/css_scrollbars.htm and modified a bit. It seems working for both IE9 and FF19

From this answer, from @Mario - It depends on the packaging. If your Maven project is WAR - put it in the webapp directory.

In fact, the html element will take on the background of body if you don't give it its own background, and html will pass this on to the canvas:That said, however, you can superimpose any background image over a background color on a single element (either html or body), without having to rely on two elements — simply use background-color and background-image or combine them in the background shorthand property:If you wish to combine two background images, you need to rely on multiple backgrounds. There are chiefly two days to do this:If you need to support older browsers, though, you'll need to go with the CSS2 method, which is supported all the way back to IE7.My comments under this other answer explain, with an accompanying fiddle, how body is actually offset from html by default margins even though it looks like it's being padded out instead, again owing to this seemingly strange phenomenon.1 This may have its roots in setting the HTML background and bgcolor attributes of body causing the background attribute to apply to the entire viewport. More on that here.Suggest reading this:https://css-tricks.com/just-one-of-those-weird-things-about-css-background-on-body/Essentially, in the absence of a background on the html element, the body background will cover the page. If there is a background on the html element, the body background behaves just like any other element.

(Yes, I have Google-d this issue, but I'm probably not entering the right search term and keep coming up with completely un-related search results.)Thanks for any suggestions or links.Yes, it resets the element's display property to the default by blanking out the inline "display: none", causing the element to fall back on its display property as defined by the page's ranking CSS rules.For example, here's a <div> with the ID of "myElement".A <div> has a setting of display:block by default. In our style sheet, suppose we specify that your <div> is to be displayed as table:Upon loading your page, the <div> is displayed as table. If you want to hide this <div> with scripting, you might do any of these:All of thse have the same effect: adding an inline style property to your <div>:If you wish to show the element again, any of these would work:These remove the display CSS property from the inline style property:Since the inline style no longer specifies a display, the <div> goes back to being displayed as table, since that's what we put in the style sheet. The <div> does not revert to being displayed as block because our CSS overrode that default setting; blanking out the inline display property does not negate the rules in our style sheets.For giggles, here's the Google query I used for verification of my answer: javascript style display empty string default...and a couple of links where this is mentioned:http://jszen.blogspot.com/2004/07/table-rowsrevealed.htmlhttp://www.harrymaugans.com/2007/03/05/how-to-create-a-collapsible-div-with-javascript-and-css/ 

(not in the article, but in the comments section)It sets the display style to the default value for that element. For most elements if not all, the default value is something other than none.It removes the value for the display property so that the default value is used.It does not reset the original display property.If you for example have this:And do this:the display style used for the element ends up being inline because that's the default for the element, it is not reset back to the style specified in the HTML code.It sets the css for that element's display to null  which essentially wipes out what was set and it reverts to its default value.

How can I just use the bootstrap.less as reference for compiling?The core question you ask is For LESS 1.5 it is now possible to import a file purely as a reference. Like so:No actual code will output from that file as CSS, but all becomes available to use as mixins. [DISCLAIMER: it is uncertain if this would work as of 1.3.3, but this original answer I do believe has some usefulness in later versions as well. However, for truly getting what the OP wanted, the new capability in LESS 1.5 is recommended.]Current versions of LESS (1.3.3) can accommodate this through the use of a namespace. Like so:By making the namespace a mixin (the addition of the parentheses after the name), it will still import the file (I know of no way to access it externally without importing), but it should not compile the actual bootstrap code into your final css file output. What this technique should do is allow you access to bootstrap's classes, mixins, etc., through the namespace call #bootstrapRef >, making it possible to use those in your own defined classes, etc.I have not fully tested if there are any bugs to this, it should just work theoretically.Doing this in LESS is a bit tricky but can be achieved like so:resulting in some additional classes being declared from mixins.less and variables.less. Mostly just .clearfix and then all of the .btn classes are added to input#submitSee the long output here:http://pastebin.com/ZBAZZ3kSI'm not sure if there is a tool for import only current referring css rules inside an external file, but Boostrap has a very organized structure, so check if the styles you are looking for are on mixins.less, so you don't have to import the entire bootstrap.less file.Also, check this related question, there are some good Best Practices for customize Boostrap.EDIT: As @PavloMykhalov suggest, maybe is better to look at buttons.lessNote: It will be awesome a tool for this sort of things. Some day I will work on thatDon't know what made you believe that LESS currently supports that, for this to be possible the option must be a lot more explicit, it currently really simply imports, parses, saves chunks, executes chunks into output text. Unless there is nothing explicit to stop this sequence, it will not do it any differently. I have just logged a feature request under LESS, don't know for sure if this has been requested before though, searched and found nothing, hope I don't get slapped for repetition! https://github.com/cloudhead/less.js/issues/1169UPDATE

The issues turned out to be a duplicate, the issue open is here: https://github.com/cloudhead/less.js/issues/622

There can be a changing number of floating children, and the parent has to auto-size its height. (The parent div serves as a background for all the floating divs).

The current accepted answer is correct, however it's usually a better idea to clear floats by applying the clearfix hack or overflow: hidden to a wrapping parent element so that margins continue to functions as expected, and to get rid of an empty HTML element.CSS:Markup:CSS:Markup:You should use the clearfix technique on the containing divhttp://www.webtoolkit.info/css-clearfix.htmlThat removes the need to add extra markup.Adding the overflow css property on the parent element will fix the issue (no need for an empty & ugly div element to clear the float) :I added the display and width properties because some browsers will need theses properties to be defined.You need to apply clearfix to the parent as floats are removed from the flow of the document an don't automatically add any height to the parent's contents. Clearfix instructs teh parent to extend to a height tall enough to clear its last floated child. This method is well established and works across browsers.

Although this technique may still be useful if you don't specifically want to darken the image, but instead want to highlight it on hover/focus/other state for whatever reason.Easy asif you want only the background-image to be affected, you can use a linear gradient to do that, just like this:If you want it darker, make the alpha value higher, else you want it lighter, make alpha lowerI would make a new image of the dog's silhouette (black) and the rest the same as the original image. In the html, add a wrapper div with this silhouette as as background. Now, make the original image semi-transparent. The dog will become darker and the background of the dog will stay the same. You can do :hover tricks by setting the opacity of the original image to 100% on hover. Then the dog pops out when you mouse over him!styleWebkit only solutionQuick solution, relies on the -webkit-mask-image property. -webkit-mask-image sets a mask image for an element.There are a few gotchas with this method:If you can look past those issues, this might be a possible solution.

The style-type isn't showing up in either Firefox or IE.The only other CSS I've applied to UL's are in a #nav div but that CSS doesn't touch the list-style-type, it uses the reset that YUI provided, and YUI and the site style sheet are the only two CSS sheets that are called.I've also got FCKEditor on the admin side of the site and that editor does show the bullet styles so I know it has to be something with the CSS that isn't being filtered by FCKEditor.If I'm not mistaken, you should be applying this rule to the li, not the ul.You need to include the following in your css:li { display: list-item; }This triggers Firefox to show the disc.and you can also give a left-margin if the reset.css you are using make all margin null : 

that means :Assuming you apply this css after the reset, it should work !Matthieu RicaudMargin messes with this tooMake sure the 'li' doesn't have overflow: hidden applied.This problem was caused by the li display attribute being set to block in a parent class. Overriding with list-item solved the problem.I had this problem and it turned out I didn't have any padding on the ul, which was stopping the discs from being visible.My reset.css was margin: 0, padding: 0. After several hours of looking and troubleshooting this worked:All I can think of is that something is over-riding this afterwards.You are including the reset styles first, right?In IE I just use a class "normal_ol" for styling an ol list and made some modifications shown below:previous code:

ol.normal_ol { float:left; padding:0 0 0 25px; margin:0; width:500px;}

ol.normal_ol li{  font:normal 13px/20px Arial; color:#4D4E53; float:left; width:100%;}modified code:

ol.normal_ol { float:left; padding:0 0 0 25px; margin:0;}

ol.normal_ol li{  font:normal 13px/20px Arial; color:#4D4E53; }All you have to do is add this class to your css. Including the padding and margin set at 0 is extremely important. Trust me. Turns out that YUI's reset CSS strips the list style from 'ul li' instead of just 'ul', which is why setting it just in 'ul' never worked.

Because of that, the whole selector got corrupted and didn't work.

http://jsfiddle.net/a96f6/87/Edit:

Seems like (after an update?) this doesn't work anymore, try this:Note: don't mix the vendor prefix selectors (-moz, -webkit, -ms, ...). Chrome for example won't understand "-moz-" and then ignores the whole selector.Edit for clarification:

To make it work in all browsers, use this code:​As @Alex said, for some reason you can't combine the selectors for multiple browsers.This will workBut this won't work (in Chrome at least):Looks like a browser implementation quirk to me.Also, note that you don't have to define placeholder styles globally, you can still scope the ::placeholder selector just like you normally do. This works:I  have just experienced  the same problem and thought it would be good to share.

For some reason, the color was not changing on firefox and I noticed that its only when I use hexadecimal values so I did it this way for a particular website:

Suppose a HTML element's id is known, so the element can be refereced using:Does a native Javascript function exist that can be used to append a CSS class to that element?

2009-05-29 17:58:23Z

Suppose a HTML element's id is known, so the element can be refereced using:Does a native Javascript function exist that can be used to append a CSS class to that element?Voilà. This will work on pretty much every browser ever. The leading space is important, because the className property treats the css classes like a single string, which ought to match the class attribute on HTML elements (where multiple classes must be separated by spaces). Incidentally, you're going to be better off using a Javascript library like prototype or jQuery, which have methods to do this, as well as functions that can first check if an element already has a class assigned.In prototype, for instance:See how much nicer that is?!Adding class using element's classList property:Removing:classList is a convenient alternative to accessing an element's list of classes.. see http://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element.classList.Not supported in IE < 10When an element already has a class name defined, its influence on the element is tied to its position in the string of class names. 

Later classes override earlier ones, if there is a conflict.Adding a class to an element ought to move the class name to the sharp end of the list, if it exists already.You should be able to set the className property of the element.  You could do a += to append it.This will add ONE class or MULTIPLE classes : you could use setAttribute.Example:

Is it possible to use CSS3 transitions with a different delay switching between "states"?

In the example below, when an element is hovered, the initial delay on hover is 0 but on mouseout the transition is delayed by 1s.You can find the full CSS in my question's updated demo below. I've used the shorthand transition property, the order of the values are:Here is a simplified JSFiddle example.

It seems pointless and uses more resources to be converted to the CSS margin-left?jQuery's underlying code passes these strings to the DOM, which allows you to specify the CSS property name or the DOM property name in a very similar way:is equivalent to:jQuery's not really doing anything special.  It may alter or proxy some strings that you pass to .css(), but in reality there was no work put in from the jQuery team to allow either string to be passed.  There's no extra resources used because the DOM does the work.I think it is so it can keep consistency with the available options used when settings multiple css styles in one function call through the use of an object, for example...as you can see the property are not specified as strings. JQuery also supports using string if you still wanted to use the dash, or for properties that perhaps cannot be set without the dash, so the following still works...without the quotes here, the javascript would not parse correctly as property names cannot have a dash in them.EDIT: It would appear that JQuery is not actually making the distinction itsleft, instead it is just passing the property specified for the DOM to care about, most likely with style[propertyName];Late to answer, but no-one has specified that css property with dash won't work in object declaration in jquery:So, do not forget to use quotes if you prefer to use dash style property in jquery code.when is marginLeft being used:As you can see, attributes that has a hyphen on it are converted to camelcased format. Using the margin-left from the previous code block above would make JavaScript bonkers because it will treat the hyphen as an operation for subtraction.when is margin-left used:Theoretically, both code blocks will do the same thing. We can allow hyphens on the second block because it is a string value while compared to the first block, it is somewhat an object.

Now that should make sense.jQuery is simply supporting the way CSS is written.Also, it ensures that no matter how a browser returns a value, it will be understood Hi i tried this it is working.

For full image background, check this:You need to use background-size: 100% 100%;DemoDemo 2 (Won't stretch, this is what you are doing)Explanation: You need to use 100% 100% as it sets for X AS WELL AS Y, you are setting 100% just for the X parameter, thus the background doesn't stretch vertically.Still, the image will stretch out, it won't be responsive, if you want to stretch the background proportionately, you can look for background-size: cover; but IE will create trouble for you here as it's CSS3 property, but yes, you can use CSS3 Pie as a polyfill. Also, using cover will crop your image.I found this: FullAn easy to use, full page image background template for Bootstrap 3 websiteshttp://startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/full/orusing in your main div container:htmlcss:Check this out, The file path 'images/ip-box.png' implies that the css file is at the same level as the images folder.It's probably more common to have 'images' and 'css' folders at the same level as the 'index.html' file.If that were the case and the css file were one level down in its respective folder, then the path to ip-box.jpg as specified in the css file would be: '../images/ip-box.png'Set Responsive and User friendly  Background Try this:

That way you won't have to worry about overriding Bootstrap.HTMLCSSFiddle: https://jsfiddle.net/x05f4crg/1/Bootstrap sometimes uses contextual class constructs.

Any ideas?That is there to add some uniqueness to the filename, so that when they change the CSS file, they can change the extra bit to be totally sure that every client will reload the CSS rather than use a cached version.The webserver will ignore the parameter and serve /Content/all.min.css normallyNote: While it's possible the CSS is dynamically generated, this is a common idiom for ensuring a reload, and given the parameter is a date, it seems quite likely.Edit: Podcast 38 mentioned this...It's to "clear the cache" every time the style is updated. I would speculate that whoever is responsible for those styles increments it every time there is a change. It's because the browser sees a different URL in the style field, so it will grab the latest version, even though it's technically in the same place on the server.As helpfully pointed out in the comments, css files often have their expiry set well into the future, this method is a nice sidestep to cache related headers.Quite a useful trick.It is to make the browser think it is a new file every-time to it refreshes its cache.Very useful when your stylesheets change regularly...

So each of my components is importing in it's component specific css file, like so:This works fine when styling individual components, but how do I apply global styling (html, body, header tags, divs, etc.) that isn't component specific? Since you're using the ES6 import syntax you may use the same syntax to import your stylesheetAlso, you can wrap your class with :global to switch to the global scope (this mean CSS Module won't modulify it, eg: adding a random id next to it)This can be done by simply adding:(thanks @elmeister who correctly answered this question.)The only way I found for importing styles globally, but only for a specific route is adding:inside the return of render method.Otherwise, the style tag would be added to the <head>, and the styles would be applied for all next routes.From https://medium.learnreact.com/the-style-tag-and-react-24d6dd3ca974Maybe the styles could be imported as a string from a file to have the code more organized.I had encountered the same problem and found the following ways to address the issue, you may choose what applies to you bestA sample is given below:If you are defining mode as global then all your included css classes will not be replaced with hashed names, instead only the ones you specify as :local will be given unique names. For example:Solution 1 :  Import global styles in starting point of reactapp.

I have done this but doesn't work:Following lines are used to define a font in cssFollowing lines to define/use the font in cssOne of the best source of information on this topic is Paul Irish's Bulletproof @font-face syntax article.Read it and you will end with something like:Go through http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-fonts/ 

Try this: Try this link1,link2     I used Ataturk's font like this. I didn't use "TTF" version. I translated orginal font version ("otf" version) to "eot" and "woof" version.

Then It works in local but not working when I uploaded the files to server.

So I added "TTF" version too like this. Now, It's working on Chrome and Firefox but Internet Explorer still defence.

When you installed on your computer "Ataturk" font, then working IE too. But I wanted to use this font without installing.You can see it on my website here: http://www.canotur.comWhen I went to Google fonts all they gave me were true type font files .ttf and didn't explain at all how to use the @font-face to include them into my document. I tried the web font generator from font squirrel too, which just kept running the loading gif and not working... I then found this site - https://transfonter.org/I had great success using the following method:I selected the Add Fonts button, leaving the default options, added all of my .ttf that Google gave me for Open Sans (which was like 10, I chose a lot of options...).Then I selected the Convert button.Heres the best part!They gave me a zip file with all the font format files I selected, .ttf, .woff and .eot. Inside that zip file they had a demo.html file that I just double clicked on and it opened up a web page in my browser showing me example usages of all the different css font options, how to implement them, and what they looked like etc.@font-faceI still didn't know at this point how to include the fonts into my stylesheet properly using @font-face but then I noticed that this demo.html came with it's own stylesheet in the zip as well. I opened the stylesheet and it showed how to bring in all of the fonts using @font-face so I was able to quickly, and easily, copy paste this into my project -The demo.html also had it's own inline stylesheet that was interesting to take a look at, though I am familiar with working with font weights and styles once they are included so I didn't need it much. For an example of how to implement a font style onto an html element for reference purposes you could use the following method in a similar case to mine after @font-face has been used properly -

How do i rotate text in css to get following output...hi,Edit:Thanks for quick suggestion. I have added my sample code in jsfidle:http://jsfiddle.net/koolkabin/yawYM/The problem i am facing is that when we rotate the text then it breaks the alignment and positions... so what is causing that and how can i manage them?You need to use the CSS3 transform property rotate - see here for which browsers support it and the prefix you need to use.One example for webkit browsers is -webkit-transform: rotate(-90deg);Edit: The question was changed substantially so I have added a demo that works in Chrome/Safari (as I only included the -webkit- CSS prefixed rules). The problem you have is that you do not want to rotate the title div, but simply the text inside it. If you remove your rotation, the <div>s are in the correct position and all you need to do is wrap the text in an element and rotate that instead.There already exists a more customisable widget as part of the jQuery UI - see the accordion demo page. I am sure with some CSS cleverness you should be able to make the accordion vertical and also rotate the title text :-)Edit 2: I had anticipated the text center problem and have already updated my demo. There is a height/width constraint though, so longer text could still break the layout.Edit 3: It looks like the horizontal version was part of the original plan but I cannot see any way of configuring it on the demo page. I was incorrect… the new accordion is part of the upcoming jQuery UI 1.9! So you could try the development builds if you want the new functionality.Hope this helps!In your case, it's the best to use rotate option from transform property as mentioned before. There is also writing-mode property and it works like rotate(90deg) so in your case, it should be rotated after it's applied. Even it's not the right solution in this case but you should be aware of this property. Example:More about transform: https://kolosek.com/css-transform/More about writing-mode: https://css-tricks.com/almanac/properties/w/writing-mode/ I guess this is what you are looking for?Added an example:The html:The css:Alle examples are from the mentioned site.You can use like this...Have a look at this fiddle:http://jsfiddle.net/anish/MAN4g/

I have a (horizontally) centered outer div containing two elements of unknown width:Both floats are top-aligned by default, and are of varying/unknown and different heights. Is there any way to make them vertically centered?I eventually made the outer divand the inner divs but I'm just curious if there's a way to do this with the floats.You can't do this directly, because floats are aligned to the top:The exact rules say (emphasis mine):That said, you can take advantage of rule #4:Be aware that some space might appear between the inline-block wrappers. See How to remove the space between inline-block elements? to fix it.Another approach would be to use flex -- it could be a replacement for a float if you have two parts. One (floating) would be of auto size, and the second would grow to occupy entire container. On the cross axis you pick center and voila, you have the effect of the float and centered elements.Here is beautiful cheatsheet about flex: http://jonibologna.com/flexbox-cheatsheet/Nope this is when table cells suddenly seem like a great idea. If it is a fixed height you can use line-height.

I want to add some shine to an element on webpage. I would prefer if I don't have to add additional html to the page. I want the image to appear in front of the element rather than behind. What's the best way to do this?To achieve a "foreground image" without extra HTML code, you can use a pseudo-element (::before / :before) plus the CSS pointer-events. The last property is needed so that the user can actually click through the layer "as if it did not exists".Here's an example (using a color whose alpha channel is 50% so that you can see that the real elements can actually be focused): http://jsfiddle.net/JxNdT/PS. I picked the ::before pseudo-element, because that naturally leads to the correct positioning. If I pick ::after, then I have to add position:relative; to the real element (#cont), and top:0;left:0; to the pseudo-element (::after).PPS. To get the foreground effect on elements without a fixed size, an additional element is needed. This wrapper element requires the position:relative;display:inline-block; styles. Set the width and height of the pseudo-element to 100%, and the pseudo-element will stretch to the width and height of the wrapper element. Demo: http://jsfiddle.net/JxNdT/1/.You can use this cssNOTESet the z-index to index greater the the z-index of the element over which you are putting the image.If you have not specified any z-index then 1 would do the work.You can also set z-index to -1,in that case the image would always be at background!If you need a white-transparent foregroundThis is for future visitors like me who are considering adding a white-transparent foreground to an element to communicate that it's hidden / disabled for instance. You can often achieve your goal by simply lowering the opacity below 1:A neat solution: box-sizing + padding-left, see more at css-tricksSomewhere in your HTML:The CSS for replacing the image (on hovering)

Can I use DIV Class and ID together in CSS?

For example:

2010-12-06 22:49:54Z

Can I use DIV Class and ID together in CSS?

For example:Yes, yes you can.Similarly:Incidentally this might be useful in some use cases (wherein classes are used to represent some form of event or interaction), but for the most part it's not necessarily that useful, since ids are unique in the document anyway. But if you're using classes for user-interaction then it can be useful to know.You can also use as many classes as needed on a tag, but an id must be unique to the document.

Also be careful of using too many divs, when another more semantic tag can do the job.Of course you can.Your HTML there is just fine. To style the elements with css you can use the following approaches:Also you can add as many classes as you wish to your elementAnd you can style that element using a selector with any combination of the classes and id. 

For example:That's HTML, but yes, you can bang pretty much any selectors you like together.(And the HTML is fine too)Yes, in one single division you can use both but it's not very common. While styling you will call both so it will cause some ambiguity if you don't properly choose "x" and "y".

Use # for ID and . for class. And for overall division you will either do separate styling or write:  #x .y for styling purposes.Yes, why not? Then CSS that applies to class "x" AND CSS that applies to ID "y" applies to the div.If you want to target a specific class and ID in CSS, then use a format like div.x#y {}.#y.x should work. And it's convenient too. You can make a page with different kinds of output. You can give a certain element an id, but give it different classes depending on the look you want.Yes you can.You just need to understand what they are for, the class is more general and can be used several times, the id (is like your id's) you can use it only once.This excellent tutorial  helped me with that:The Difference Between ID and ClassThough it's not an exact answer to your question I'm sure it will help you a lot!Good luck!EDIT: Reading your question, I just want to clarify that:And that if you want to "use them" in CSS for styling purposes you should do as David Says: #x.y { }

I'm trying to set the style of an option in a select dropdown menu in Google Chrome. It works in all browsers except IE9 and Chrome.Without using JavaScript, is there a way to set style to the options in Google Chrome? Once selected the background color does not display.Unfortunately, WebKit browsers do not support styling of <option> tags yet, except for color and background-color.The most widely used cross browser solution is to use <ul> / <li> and style them using CSS. Frameworks like Bootstrap do this well.It's a choice (from browser devs or W3C, I can't find any W3C specification about styling select options though) not allowing to style select options.I suspect this would be to keep consistency with native choice lists.

(think about mobile devices for example).3 solutions come to my mind:Since version 49+, Chrome has supported styling <option> elements with font-weight. Source: https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=44917#c22There was a Chrome stylesheet, themeChromiumSkia.css, that used font-weight: normal !important; in it all this time. It was introduced to the stable Chrome channel in version 49.0.I actually discovered something recently that seems to work for styling individual <option></option> elements within Chrome, Firefox, and IE using pure CSS.Maybe, try the following:HTML:CSS:Strange what throwing caution to the wind does. It doesn't seem to support the :active :hover :focus :link :visited :after :before, though.Example on JSFiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/Xd7TJ/2/I have a workaround using jquery... although we cannot style a particular option, we can style the select itself - and use javascript to change the class of the select based on what is selected. It works sufficiently for simple cases.Note that the js is in two parts, the each part for initializing everything on the page correctly, the .on('change', ... part for responding to change. I was unable to mangle the js into a function to DRY it up, it breaks it for some reason

http://jsfiddle.net/pht9d295/3/And CSSWell, it looks like the select tags doesn't allow :after or :before pseudos because they are customized by each vendor, so it's quite hard to modify them and that's because they don't allow :before or :after pseudo elements on them.To everyone who sees this, there's a good option to create a custom select element with jQuery and minimal modification… Create a select and then use jQuery to edit it:http://jsfiddle.net/tovic/ZTHkQ/This is a modern solution I cooked up using font-awesome. I'm not sure how cross-browser friendly it is. Vendor extensions have been omitted for brevity.HTMLSCSSIf your select element has a defined background color, then this won't work as this snippet essentially places the Chevron icon behind the select element (to allow clicking on top of the icon to still initiate the select action).However, you can style the select-wrapper to the same size as the select element and style its background to achieve the same effect.Check out my CodePen for a working demo that shows this bit of code on both a dark and light themed select box using a regular label and a "placeholder" label and other cleaned up styles such as borders and widths.

Active hyperlink texts are highlighted with dotted border. When using effects on such hyperlinks (fadeIn/fadeOut) it produces strange effects. How do I disable/remove the dotted border?Try this CSS:Note that this has to be after any a:hover rules. Thanks to PEra in the comments for suggesting using the a:selected selector as well.NOTEThe above does not work in IE 9.  Removing a:selected causes it to work in IE9.Typical and safe way to do it is this:Since expresssion() has been gutted in IE8, you may need a script:If you're going to remove the default focus outline, you must  define your own distinct style for :focus, otherwise keyboard users will have a hard time using your site.Be careful. The dotted-border is a valuable part of keyboard-browsing. It highlights which link will be clicked.Author Nathan Smith gives a more thorough discussion of this, and various related issues on his blog.Try with this CSS:For Mozilla:For IE8:The a { outline: none; } breaks keyboard usability. And the a:active {} selector seems to break it just as good last time I checked in Firefox.There is a JS way to get rid of the border without breaking anything, as well as JS code to get rid of the border in IE6 and IE7.I described the method in my tutorial.Solution in JavaScript to remove the active border on the links on all the browsers:

add the event onfocus="this.blur();" on your link     NOTE: this will work in all browsers.Taken from here:

I can't seem to find much information about this.Smashing Magazine seems to be saying that html and :root are the same thing but surely there must be a tiny difference?From the W3C wiki:CSS is a general purpose styling language. It can be used with other document types, not only with HTML, it can be used with SVG for example.From the specification (emphasis mine):One technical difference between them is that :root - being a pseudo class has a greater specificity than html (a type selector)So, in the above example, the :root selector overrides the html selector and the text appears red.For HTML documents, there is no difference - your root element is the <html> tag, so html{} and :root{} are (besides from a difference in specificity) semantically equivalent. However, you can apply CSS not only to HTML, but all XML-like documents. That's why :root is there - to target the document's root element regardless of document type. Most people are confused by the difference because the overwhelmingly predominant use case for CSS is styling HTML documents.Example:

You can style SVG documents with CSS. When styling it, your root element will (obviously;-)) not be html but svg. See the following list of SVG tags.

I have started a jsfiddleDo i need to use the propertyCould anyone give me some pointers on achieving this please.ThanksThe thing you will need to do here is use a linear gradient as background and animate the background position. In code:Use a linear gradient (50% red, 50% blue) and tell the browser that background is 2 times larger than the element's width (width:200%, height:100%), then tell it to position the background left.On hover, change the background position to right bottom and with transition:all 2s ease;, the position will change gradually (it's nicer with linear tough)

    background-position:right bottom;http://jsfiddle.net/75Umu/3/As for the -vendor-prefix'es, see the comments to your questionextra

If you wish to have a "transition" in the colour, you can make it 300% width and make the transition start at 34% (a bit more than 1/3) and end at 65% (a bit less than 2/3). A single css code on hover can do the trick:

For single left angle quote, use &lsaquo;From the description and from the reference to the search box in the Ubuntu site, I gather that you actually want an arrowhead character pointing to the right. There are no Unicode characters designed to be used as arrowheads, but some of them may visually resemble an arrowhead.In particular, if you draw your idea of the character at Shapecatcher.com, you will find many suggestions, such as「〉」RIGHT-POINTING ANGLE BRACKET' (U+232A) and「❭」MEDIUM RIGHT-POINTING ANGLE BRACKET ORNAMENT (U+276D).Such characters generally have limited support in fonts, so you would need to carefully write a longish font-family list or to use a downloadable font. See my Guide to using special characters in HTML.Especially if the intended use is as a symbol in a search box, as the reference to the Ubuntu page suggests, it is questionable whether you should use a character at all. It’s not really an element of text here; rather, a graphic symbol that accompanies text but isn’t a part of it. So why take all the trouble with using a character (safely), when it isn’t really a character?I use ▸ (0x25B8) for the right arrow, often to show a collapsed list; and I pair it with ▾ (0x25BE) to show the list opened up. Both are unobtrusive.

2016-08-19 07:10:26Z

In HTML when do I use color, and what is the difference between background-color and also the background tag?What are the differences?color is referring to the text color in that element.background-color refers to the background colorbackground is shorthand to combine many background tags into one line.Combines color, image and background image properties in the one line instead of typing our each style individually.w3schoolsI will give you a example using this html element:<span class="value"> This is my text </span>.value { color: red, background-color: black}The CSS color is used to change the text color of a html element. In this example "This is my text" would be red. The CSS background-color is used to change the background color so in this case you would get a black box with red text inside it. Finally the background is used to set all the background properties in one declaration. For example:background: #00ff00 url("smiley.gif") no-repeat fixed center;This changes the background color, adds the image "smiley.gif" to the background and it centers the image, it doesnt repeat the image if it has the space.Quick answergreat tutorials on this are found hereIt is true that background gives more options versus background-color.  But if you only need to set background color, they are exactly the same, and each will override the other as seen in the snippet.

. It's not great but does the trick with no side effects.The HTML:(put this below the body tags)The CSS:What this does to solve the issue: It forces Chrome to think the page's content is 100% when it's not - this stops the body 'appearing' the size of the content and resolves the missing background bug. This is basically doing what height: 100% does when applied to the body or html but you don't get the side effect of having your backgrounds cut off when scrolling (past 100% page height) like you do with a 100% height on those elements. I can sleep now =]I had the same issue on a couple of sites and fixed it by moving the background styling from body to html (which I guess is a variation of the body {} to html, body{} technique already mentioned but shows that you can make do with the style on html only), e.g.becomesThis worked in IE6-8, Chrome 4-5, Safari 4, Opera 10 and Firefox 3.x with no obvious nasty side-effects.I was able to fix this with:HTML and body height 100% doesn't work in older IE versions.You have to move the backgroundproperties from the body element to the html element.

That will fix it crossbrowser.Simple, correct, solution - define the background image and colour in html, not body.  Unless you've defined a specific height (not a percentage) in the body, its height will be assumed to be as tall as required to hold all content.  so your background styling should go into html, which is the entire html document, not just the body.  Simples.After trying all of the other solutions here without success, I skeptically tried the solution found in this article, and got it to work.Essentially, it boils down to removing @charset "utf-8"; from your CSS.This seems like a poor implementation in DreamWeaver - but it did fix the issue for me, regardless.I am not sure 100%, but try to replace selector with "html, body":I would try what Logan and 1mdm suggested, tho tweak the CSS, but I would really wait for a new Chrome version to come out with fixed bugs, before growing white hair.  IMHO the current Chrome version is still alpha version and was released so that it can spread while it is in development. I personally had issues with table widths, my code worked fine in EVERY browser but could not make it work in Chrome.  Google Chrome and safari needs a tweak for body and background issues.

We have use additional identifier as mentioned below.Use both body and #body identifier and enter same styles in both.

Make the body tag with id attribute of body.This works for me.Adam's chromeFix solution with Paul Alexander's pure-CSS modification solved the problem in Chrome, but not in Safari.  A couple additional tweaks solved the problem in Safari, too: width: 100% and z-index:-1 (or some other appropriate negative value that puts this element behind all the other elements on the page).The CSS:I had the same thing in both Chrome and Safari aka Webkit browsers. I'm suspecting it's not a bug, but the incorrect use of css which 'breaks' the background.In the Question above, the body background property is set to:Which is fine, but not entirely correct. There's no image background, thus...I'm seen this problem with Chrome too, if I remember correctly if you minimize and then maximize your window it fixes it as well?Haven't really used Chrome too much since it was released but this is definitely something I blame on Google as the code I was checking it on was air tight.Everybody has said your code is fine, and you know it works on other browsers without problems. So it's time to drop the science and just try stuff :)Try putting the background color IN the body tag itself instead of/as-well-as in the CSS. Maybe insist again (redudantly) in Javascript. At some point, Chrome will have to place the background as you want it every time. Might be a timing-interpreting issue...[Should any of this work, of course, you can toggle it on the server-side so the funny code only shows up in Chrome. And in a few months, when Chrome has changed and the problem disappears... well, worry about that later.]It must be a WebKit issue as it is in both Safari 4 and Chrome.I'm pretty sure this is a bug in Chrome. Most likely it happens if you resize the browser TO full screen, then switch tabs. And sometimes if you just switch tabs/open a new one. Good to hear you found a "fix" though.SourceWorked for me :)Here is how I ended up solving the problem:This was the actual issue, clearly the body tag defined in CSS was not picked up.My environment: Chrome Browser/Safari, First time when it does not work, So according to the thread recommendation here I ended up adding the css file with the html entrySample CSS file: mystyle.cssSample html file:After the first loading it will work in Chrome and then go back to CSS file comment the html entry, so your modified CSS will be Clearly seems to be bug in webkit, Saw the same behavior in Safari as well.

Do not use a minifier if you have a lot of hacks going on (or put them in a separate file).Any tips on my python appreciated. Please be gentle though, it's my first time. :-)There is a port of YUI's CSS compressor available for python.Here is its project page on PyPi:

After checking and verifying that the license allows for it, you could go through the source code and snip out the portions that do the minifying yourself. Then stick this in a single script and voila! There you go.As a head start, the csscombine function in .../trunk/src/cssutils/script.py seems to do the work of minifying somewhere around line 361 (I checked out revision 1499). Note the boolean function argument called "minify".There is a nice online tool cssminifier which has also an API which is pretty simple and easy to use.

I made a small python script that posts the CSS file content to that tool's API, returns the minifed CSS and saves it into a file "style.min.css". I like it because it is a small code that may be nicely integrated in an automated deployment script:In the webassets docs you can find links to multiple compressors and compilers.

I want to store my background URLs in custom properties (CSS variables) and use them with the background property. However, I couldn't find a way to interpolate the string when using it as a parameter in url().Here is my sample code:I know that this can be easily done in Sass or LESS using the interpolation function but I'm curious if there is a way to do it without any pre-processor.You can perform interpolation with most CSS functions, including rgba() (see an example here). In fact, interpolation is one of the main features of custom properties.But you cannot do this with url(), as url(var(--url)) is parsed not as a url( function token followed by var(--url) followed by a ), but a single url() token that is invalid because the var(--url) is being treated as a URL itself, and unquoted URLs in url() tokens cannot contain parentheses unless they are escaped. This means the substitution never actually occurs, because the parser never sees any var() expressions in the property value — indeed, your background declaration is completely invalid.If you didn't understand any of that, that's fine. Just know that you cannot use var() interpolation with url() due to legacy reasons.Even though the problem depicted in the question is related to the legacy url() token, you cannot do this by building URL tokens out of several var() expressions either, in case you were thinking of trying something like --uo: url(; --uc: ); or --uo: url("; --uc: ");, and background: var(--uo) var(--url) var(--uc);. This is because custom properties cannot contain unmatched string delimiters or parts of url() tokens (called bad URL tokens).If you want to specify a URL in a custom property, you need to write out the entire url() expression, and substitute that entire expression:Or, use JavaScript instead of var() to perform the interpolation.I had the same issue on a project with cordova so i used:Apparently if you use url("") with double quotes on the --var declaration, the value will not work.

MVC Bundling and CSS relative URLs

It's in IIS's "Default Web Site".Which has the following in BundleConfig.cs:The bundling system is generating the wrong URL for any images referenced in those CSS files, yielding 404's even JQueryUI's very well tested CSS files (from FireBug):e.g. it's generating When it should be generating:How do I get the bundling system to generate a URL that points to the right location?CssRewriteUrlTransform updates the CSS Url with absolute path, saying so if we use -and we have following CSS class in "site.css"and following folder structure -Bundling will generate following CSS Url Path for "background-image" - And now if you hosting the website / web application as a website on web server above path will work,

because browser will send request for this resource using following Url because of leading '/'but if you host the website as web application this will create problem. Because browser will still interpret this as absolute Url instead of relative and still send following request to fetch this resource -So, the solution for this problem is using the relative Url even in CSS file and then remove the CssRewriteUrlTransform from the Bundle config as below - The reason for the broken images is that it tries to find the images relative to the new path defined during bundling i.e.So if there is any image path (i.e. background image) defined in style.css, it will try to get its path relative to Content/woothemes instead of Content/woothemes/css/, hence the images will not be foundOne workaround to overcome the issue for the files of same folder is to define the new path same as that of the folder (whose files are being minified) i.e.This way the bundled files and the actual files path will match and the images defined in the css will be found, hence the issue will be resolvedThe issue will only not be resolved if you mix the files from different folders for the same reason described aboveThis works for me,

Is there a recommended way to do this in React.js, perhaps with a popular add-on?(In a similar past situation using D3, a technique I've used was roughly:Now I'm hoping for a similar effect in a React-ish way...)I just released a module to tackle exactly this problemhttps://github.com/joshwcomeau/react-flip-moveIt does a few things differently than Magic Move / Shuffle:Check out the demos:http://joshwcomeau.github.io/react-flip-move/examples/#/shuffleReact Shuffle is solid and up to date.  It's inspired by Ryan Florences Magic Move demo https://github.com/FormidableLabs/react-shuffleI realise this is a bit of an old question and you've probably found a solution by now, but for anyone else coming across this question, check out the MagicMove library by Ryan Florence. It's a React library to handle the exact scenario you describe: https://github.com/ryanflorence/react-magic-move See it in action: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z5e7kWSHWTg#t=424Edit: This is broken in React 0.14.  See React Shuffle as an alternative, as suggested by Tim Arney below.The best way I can think of to accomplish this off the top of my head would be to first make sure that you give every one of your elements a key as described here:http://facebook.github.io/react/docs/multiple-components.html#dynamic-childrenNext I would define CSS3 animation similar to this:Animating lists with CSS3Basically in your render function you would calculate where the element is suppose to go, ReactJS will place the element where it's suppose to be (make sure you give each element the same key every time! This is important to make sure ReactJS reuses your DOM element properly).  In theory at least, the CSS should take care of the rest of the animation for you outside of reactjs/javascript.Disclamer... I've never actually tried this ;)I didn't want to use a third-part library for my animations so I implemented the "FLIP" animation technique using React lifecycle methods getSnapshotBeforeUpdate() and componentDidUpdate().When the list item's props.index changes the old position is captured in getSnapshotBeforeUpdate() and in componentDidUpdate() the css transform: translateY() is applied so that the item appears to be animating from old position to current position.Because the position of an element depends heavily on the DOM engine, I find it really hard to implement tweening and animating in a pure way within React components. If you want to do it cleanly, I think you need at least: a Store to hold the current position of an element, a Store to hold the next position of an element (or combine it with the previous store), and a render() method that applies the offset margins per element until in the final frame, the next positions become current. How you calculate the next positions in the first place is also a challenge. But given that the elements only swap positions, you could use the Store with the current positions to swap element #0 with element #1, by swapping their offsets in the next positions Store.In the end it's easier to just use an external library to manipulate the elements' margins after they're rendered.Just use ReactCSSTransitionGroup.

It's built into the React with Addons package and is perfect for this use case! Just make sure that the component on which you apply the transition has already mounted to the DOM. Use the CSS that is in the linked example for a nice fading transition.

Also available as a JS library.Stop the CSS animation by continuously replacing the element with JavaScript. Once JavaScript is disabled, the CSS animation kicks in and displays a message.@keyframes Browser compatibility: Chrome, Firefox 5.0+, IE 10+, Opera 12+, Safari 4.0+Hrm, I think it depends on the browser. HTML5 supports <noscript> in the HEAD element, so you might try something like this:Spec: http://dev.w3.org/html5/markup/noscript.htmlFrom the spec:Edit: hey peeps, SO does the very same! Just try turning off JS now. What about javascript code that continuously postpones a http-equiv=refresh (each time replacing the meta element?)  As soon as javascript is turned off, the meta element is no longer replaced and the refresh will eventually take place. This is just a thought, I've no idea if meta element insertion is even possible.I'd recommend looking into how this is done by HTML5 Boilerplate and Modernizr.If you look at HTML5 Boilerplate's HTML, on line 7 you'll see the <html> tag is given a class of no-js. Then, when Modernizr's JavaScript runs, the first thing it does is remove the no-js class.That done, you could apply CSS rules that only display content if the no-js class is present:Expanding upon @JoshMock's answer, here is a simple approach (via Paul Irish) to detect if the client has JS enabled:HTMLThis should be compatible with all browsers and is quite fast. Then you can hide/show elements in your css with .js and .no-js classes. If you are doing any other feature detection, I would suggest using Modernizr with the html class="no-js" markup (modernizr will automatically add the js classes for you, along with css3 detection).Actually, it is easier to detect if java-script is supported by the browser than the opposite.Of course, this is in the case of 'a site instantly detect javascript'. Witch is the very first http-request <--> response from the browser to the server. You just 'cannot'. You would have to send another request to the server after determining browser capabilities.Now, there is no way of checking if JavaScript is enabled from the server-side on the first request. So, if JavaScript is disabled, you have to do a postback, or redirect to a non JavaScript page, using what some other suggested (witch is not valid, but seems to work):There are some 'browser capabilities' and browser 'plugins' that can be get with http request, so you would need a good 'server-side' script to meet your goal.See browserhawk or quirksmode for some infos on a javascript to detect browser.Also, there is a 'protected' question aboout how-to-detect-if-javascript-is-disabled

I am carefully assessing the best way to utilize Modernizr and Respond.js for responsive design and have a couple of questions for the community.Firstly, it is my understanding that when bundling Modernizr with Respond.js, no other coding or tests are required for media query support in IE8 and below.

Correct?Secondly, do you believe this is the most efficient way to achieve support for media queries in IE8 and below? In essence, I would be including a larger Modernizr script than is needed for browsers that already support media queries. Wouldn't it be more efficient to separate the two scripts and only load Respond.js if a test for media queries fails?Third, if I would like to separate the two scripts, what do you believe is the best way to load Respond.js if needed? One option would be to use an IE specific conditional comment to load Respond. Another option is to use yepnope and Modernizr to test for media query support and load Respond if needed. Which would be more efficient and fault-proof.Lastly, if I choose to separate the two scripts and use Modernizr to load Respond if needed I have encountered the two following techniques:ORI have found that the second crashes IE8, but must just need rewriting.

Which technique would you recommend?Thanks for all the help.Well you need at least some CSS3 media queries to get you started. Respond.js is essentially just a JavaScript implementation of media queries for browsers that don't support them (e.g. IE less than 8). Just make sure the reference to Respond.js comes AFTER your CSS3 media queries (link).So, yes, assuming you have Respond.js bundled with Modernizr from a custom build or whatever, and that is loaded after your CSS3, you're all good. Also, Modernizr needs some more configuration in the  of your HTML (link)Modernizr doesn't come with support for browsers without media queries out of the box. You need to add it in a custom build. So, yes, I think it's smart to always include respond. Minified, the library only adds a little more than 3kb, and having it included in the Modernizr file won't add another GET request. I'd say just leave it in there to be prepared for everything.Third, I'd go with the Modernizr method. I like using new stuff, all that extra JavaScript gets in the way.The new version of Respond includes some feature testing so you don't need Modernizr or Yepnope!Here's the revision:

https://github.com/scottjehl/Respond/commit/4d60f45716b8395e6f24238f9dc5e34c857e87f2Also, you should note that using yepnope.js could cause a delay in which you see the non-media query styles before the media query styles are parsed and applied.  The recommendation is that you put respond.js in the header to avoid this as much as possible, although, it's also good to keep your js files in the footer so up to you.Feature testing might be in newer lib like tkane2000 says ... 

Just wanted to mention you could probably do this via Modernizr too:Original Poster has i think invalid media query check '(only all)' ... Shouldnt be any parenthesis based on some things I read. Once I removed the parens, respond.js seems to be included appropriately.

Why doesn't word wrap property work properly in the example below?http://jsfiddle.net/k5VET/739/What can I do to ensure that part of the word 'consectetur' fits in the first line itself? I want maximum number of characters to fit in each line.The css is :Use word-break: break-all;LIVE DEMOIf word-wrap: break-all don't work, try also add this:work for me with the .btn class in Bootstrap 3Okay so I know this is an old question but I seriously think there could be some useful clarification of when to use which property. Looking at the existing answers, I feel they offer solutions without explanation so here is my attempt to help with that. For context, by default, the container will not try to break a single long word up because it wants to preserve the word in it's original form.With that said, 3 main ways to break up words there is overflow-wrap, word-break, and hypens. I won't dive too deep into hypens though.So first off. I see word-wrap is being used in the question but reading the documentation, that is deprecated and some browsers have decided to simply alias it to overflow-wrap. It's probably preferred not to use that.The distinction between the two properties is pretty clear in the documentation but for clarity, overflow-wrap really only has two possible values and will detect if a word has been overflowed. If it does, by default it moves the entire word to the next line. If break-word is set, it will only break up the word if the entire word couldn't be placed on that line.You can see the pneumonoul... long word breaks exactly where it needs to on the next line after it attempts to separate the long word.Now in contrast, we have word-break. This has more granular properties and actually also has a break-word option. This is synonymous to the above snippet so when to use one or the other I think is pretty trivial. However, word-break also offers a break-all value which will break the word whenever possible to fit word where it was originally intended. It doesn't try to figure out if it needs the word to be on a new line or not -- it simply shoves the line break where it overflows. The biggest distinction here from the above is that long word we use is now still on the top.And then finally for hyphens have their own special way of breaking up words. For more info take a look at the documentation. Also worth noting that different languages have different ways of breaking up words but fortunately the hyphens property hooks into the lang attribute and understands what to do.Another option people have suggested is using the white-space property which attempts to break up text through spaces. In the example I used, this doesn't help our situation because the word itself is longer than the container. I think the important thing to note about this CSS property is that this doesn't attempt to break up words within themselves and rather tries to do it via spaces whenever appropriate. Hope this helps.It does not wrap properly, because browsers do not apply automatic hyphenation (which would be the way to cause proper wrapping) by default. You need to use CSS hyphenation or JavaScipt-based hyphenation. The setting word-wrap:break-word, as well as word-break: break-all, by definition breaks words (splits th em to piece s at arbit rary poin ts), instead of proper wrapping.Because the css word-wrap doesn't work in all browsers, use JavaScript instead! It should give the same result.The function below requires JQuery and it will run each time window re-size.The function checks if the element has more width then its parent, and if it has, it breaks all instead of words only. We don't want the children to grow bigger than it's parents, right?I only needed it for tables, so if you want it in some other element, just change "table" to "#yourId" or ".yourClass". Make sure there is a parent-div or change "div" to "body" or something?If it will go to else, it changes to word-break and then check if it should change back, that's why there is so much code.. :'/I hope it works for you!This is useful for wrapping text in one line:

This will just cause a read error and will never trigger any update on your grid's datasource, (ie. dataBound event will never happen). On the other hand, an empty datasource is still a valid datasource and will trigger the dataBound event.Anyways, here is my solution. Firstly, to emulate an empty datasource, I have set the datasource like so:Now, the proper way to check whether your grid is truly empty is to read the datasource itself. The others do it... in a more hacky way by reading html DOM. Please do NOT do this as you may have multiple pages, filters, etc... where the item is in the dataSource but not the DOM. Here is how you should do it:Now, when you read your datasource, the dataBound event is triggered every time. Thus, you should put the above code in the dataBound event. Check if grid dataSource is empty, and then fire a message to the user. Here is my full code for dataBound.What is this crazy mess above? You'll notice that I am doing a lot of stuff with the variable mBox. This is simply an empty <div> I added on the html page with id msgBox, and I am using it to instantiate a kendoWindow to create the popup saying that there is no data. You can find out more about kendoWindow here. So instead of using ugly alert boxes, I am just taking advantage of another part of kendo UI's widget library, which is customizable and controllable.The if and else logic with the mBox simply handles subsequent calls to show the message. The first time, the kendoWindow has not been instantiated so it goes through the if clause. Subsequent calls with just reopen the window. Give it a try :). You can click the next page buttons to verify that it will show the popup again. Here is a jsFiddle Demo. I know I'm late to the party but here's how I just did it. It's mostly copied from the TreeList's no data feature (I was annoyed that you didn't have the same thing with the standard grid). I made it into a prototype extension so it's automatically added to every grid. An option could also be added to make the message configurable.Can't you do something like this -Or you are looking for something even cleaner something inbuilt in Kendo?

I think, this is an issue still there in Kendo UI which hasn't been fixed yet

See this - http://www.telerik.com/forums/empty-grid-norecords-templateIf your grid has detail grids (nested grids) then the above examples wont work on the nested grids. To ensure you apply this to all of your kendo grids you can do the following:Then call this function after all of your content has been loaded, there is no need to add it to each grid individually.if you wanted to change the message then add emptyMsg to your dataSource i.e.Kendo grid No Data found message };On Grid Data Bound..Add the following script to show Message.Not sure what was the exact version this question was asked, but in my case none of the above solutions worked.I used the following one:

This is what I have jsFiddle linkWhy is there no transition? If I set Then the "subnav" will never appear (of course ) but why does the transition on the opacity not trigger? How to get the transition working?As you know the display property cannot be animated BUT just by having it in your CSS it overrides the visibility and opacity transitions.The solution...just removed the display properties.Generally when people are trying to animate display: none what they really want is:Most popular answers use visibility, which can only achieve the first goal, but luckily it's just as easy to achieve both by using position.Since position: absolute removes the element from typing document flow spacing, you can toggle between position: absolute and position: static (global default), combined with opacity. See the below example.You can do this with animation-keyframe rather than transition. Change your hover declaration and add the animation keyframe, you might also need to add browser prefixes for -moz- and -webkit-. See https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/CSS/@keyframes for more detailed info.Here is an update on your fiddle. https://jsfiddle.net/orax9d9u/1/

Creating CSS3 Circles connected by lines

[Creating CSS3 Circles connected by lines](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/19642308/creating-css3-circles-connected-by-lines)

I have to implement the following circle and line combination in CSS and I am looking for pointers on how to implement this effectively. The circles and lines should look like this:I am able to implement the circles as such:but the lines are tricky for me to understand.The size of the circle changes depending on whether it is the active step or not, and the color of the line connecting the circles changes as well depending on status. How would I accomplish this?

How would I accomplish this?You can achieve this effect with no additional markup using pseudo-elements and the adjacent sibling selector (~):Demo on CodePenWorking off of the excellent answer from @bookcasey I found myself doing it the opposite way to get it responsive;It now stretches to fill parent, and deals with different number of steps automatically. You can also do things like adjust font-size on parent ul and have the whole thing adapt.I'm sure it can be improved so feel free to contribute :)Interactive CodePen: Flexbox Timeline with steps: 

http://codepen.io/ccondrup/pen/bqbGWB?editors=1100Though this is possible with CSS3, I think SVG is a better tool for sophisticated interfaces.I made this with SVG (styled with CSS):And here's a Plunk to demonstrate.It is not my own but it works quite well and looks elegant,

only works with css and you can perzonalize it more. Source http://jsfiddle.net/Misiu/y1Lo3qh1/Well, it's a ton of markup, but you could do something like this:Use display: table-cell; as it will automatically adjust the widths of items to fill spaces.Then, have a set of circle elements, and a set of line elements. The line elements just have a bottom border on them, and the circle elements are just relatively positioned downwards to align with the line.Note that the circles need to have an extra container, otherwise table-cell will stretch all the circles to the same height, and you don't want that that. This will require you to set the width of those containers to be 1px, which will force it to the size of it's child.Check out this demo:http://jsfiddle.net/Sjdm4/Example I made based on the answer: https://codepen.io/Smakosh/pen/ZvvyMgI used Bootstrap 4 and FontAwesome to make my version of this.Here's the code pen: [a link]https://codepen.io/tr4c355/pen/roBjWVHTML & CSS:

Text not wrapping inside a div element

I am experiencing a problem that never happened before and seems really unprecedented, some text is not wrapping inside a div.In this link is a sample of my html code: http://jsfiddle.net/NDND2/2/Any help??That's because there are no spaces in that long string so it has to break out of its container. Add word-break:break-all; to your .title rules to force a break.jsFiddle exampleI found this helped where my words were breaking part way through the word in a WooThemes Testimonial plugin.play with it here http://nortronics.com.au/recomendations/you can add this line: word-break:break-all; to your CSS-codeThe problem in the jsfiddle is that your dummy text is all one word.  If you use your lorem ipsum given in the question, then the text wraps fine.If you want large words to be broken mid-word and wrap around, add this to your .title css:This may help a small percentage of people still scratching their heads. Text copied from clipboard into VSCode may have an invisible hard space character preventing wrapping. Check it with HTML inspectorMight benefit you to be aware of another option, word-wrap: break-word;The difference here is that words that can completely fit on 1 line will do that, vs. being forced to break simply because there is no more real estate on the line the word starts on.See the fiddle for an illustration http://jsfiddle.net/Jqkcp/

Change arrow colors in Bootstraps carousel

I'm obviously missing something stupidly simple here. I have images with a white background so I want to be able to edit the arrows on the Bootstraps Carousel so they are visible. So many changing the color of the arrows (NOT the background like I've done). CSSCarousel HTMLI hope this works, cheers.

I know this is an older post, but it helped me out. I've also found that for bootstrap v4 you can also change the arrow color by overriding the controls like this:Where you change fill='%23fff' the fff at the end to any hexadecimal value that you want. For example:fill='%23000' for black, fill='%23ff0000' for red and so on. Just a note, I haven't tested this without the !important declaration.If you just want to make them black in Bootstrap 4.You should use also: <span><i class="fa fa-angle-left" aria-hidden="true"></i></span> using fontawesome. You have to overwrite the original code. Do the following and you'll be free to customize on CSS:The original codeCurrently Bootstrap 4 uses a background-image with embbed SVG data info that include the color of the SVG shape. Something like:Note the part about fill='%23fff' it fills the shape with a color, in this case #fff (white), for red simply replace with #f00Finally, it is safe to include this (same change for next-icon):In bootstrap 4 if you are just changing the colour of the controls you can use the sass variables, typically in custom.scss: $carousel-control-color: #7b277d;As highlighted in this github issue note: https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/issues/21985#issuecomment-281402443a little example that works for mefor bootstrap-3 one can use:If you are using bootstrap.min.css for carousel-Open the bootstrap.min.css file and find the property "glyphicon-chevron-right" and add the property "color:red"To customize the colors for the carousel controls, captions, and indicators using Sass you can include these variables I too had a similar problem, some images were very light and some dark, so the arrows didn't always show up clearly so I took a more simplistic approach.In the modal-body section I just removed the following lines:and inserted the following into the modal-header sectionThe indicators can now be clearly seen, no adding extra icons or messing with style sheets, although you could style them however you wanted!See this demo image:[With Font Awesome icons:
