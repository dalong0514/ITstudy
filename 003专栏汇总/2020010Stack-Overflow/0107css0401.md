To get the indenting correct on any lines that wrap, try it this way:So many solutions.

But I still think there is room for improvement.Advantages:This is the W3C solution. At the moment, this works at least in Firefox. http://dev.w3.org/csswg/css-lists/#marker-contentHere is the best solution I've found so far. It works great and it's cross-browser (IE 8+). The important thing is to have the character in a floating block with a fixed width so that the text remains aligned if it's too long to fit on a single line.

1.2em is the width you want for your character, change it for your needs.You can use the :before pseudo-selector to insert content in front of the list item. You can find an example on Quirksmode, at http://www.quirksmode.org/css/beforeafter.html. I use this to insert giant quotes around blockquotes...HTH.My solution uses positioning to get wrapped lines automatically line up correctly. So you don't have to worry about setting padding-right on the li:before.Font-awesome provides a great solution out of the box:It's advisable to qualify the styling of the <li> so it does not affect <ol> list items. So:Em dash style:I prefer to use negative margin, gives you more controlInterestingly enough I do not thing any of the posted solutions are good enough, because they rely on the fact that the character used is 1em wide, which does not need to be so (with maybe exception of John Magnolia's answer which however uses floats which can complicate things another way).

I have a more or less standard navigation from bootstrap 3It collapses normally on smaller devices. Clicking on the menu button expands the menu but if I click (or touch for that matter) on a menu link, the menu stays open. What do I have to do, to close it again? Bootstrap's default setting is to keep the menu open when you click on a menu item. You can manually override this behaviour by calling .collapse('hide'); on the jQuery element that you want to collapse.Just to share this from solutions on GitHub, this was the popular answer:https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/issues/9013#issuecomment-39698247This is wired to the document, so you don't have to do it on ready() (you can dynamically append links to your menu and it will still work), and it only gets called if the menu is already expanded.  Some people have reported weird flashing where the menu opens and then immediately closes with other code that did not verify that the menu had the "in" class.[UPDATE 2014-11-04] apparently when using sub-menus, the above can cause problems, so the above got modified to:Change this: to this:This simple change worked for me.Ref: https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/issues/9013I had the same problem but caused by including twice bootstrap.js and jquery.js files.On a single click the event was processed twice by both jquery instances. One closed and one opened the toggle.This would help in handling drop down in nav barI am having/had similar issues with Bootstrap 4, alpha-6, and Joakim Johanssons answer above started me in the right direction.  No javascript required.  Putting data-target=".navbar-collapse" and data-toggle="collapse" into the div tag inside the nav, but surrounding the links/buttons, worked for me.I know this question is for Bootstrap 3 but if you are looking solution for Bootstrap 4, just do this:I had the same problem, I was using jQuery-1.7.1 and bootstrap 3.2.0.

I changed my jQuery version to the latest (jquery-1.11.2) version and everything works well.I did Though the solution posted earlier to change the menu item itself, like below, works when the menu is on a small device, it has a side effect when the menu is on full width and expanded, this can result in a horizontal scrollbar sliding over your menu items. The javascript solutions do not have this side-effect. (sorry for answering like this, wanted to add a comment to that answer, but, seems I haven't sufficient credit to make remarks )In case you want to manually override this behaviour by calling .collapse('hide') within an angular's directive, here is the code:javascript file:Html:

Please make sure You are using latest bootstrap js version. I was facing the same problem and just upgrading the bootstrap.js file from bootstrap-3.3.6 did the magic.If you only want your navigation to toggle when used on a mobile screen, just adding data-toggle="collapse" and data-target="#navbar" to your a elements will work on the mobile screen, but will give you a weird flicker when clicked on a desktop screen. The jQuery solutions do not work well if you are in an Aurelia or Angular environment.The best solution for me was to create a custom attribute that listens to the corresponding media query and adds in the data-toggle="collapse"attribute if desired:<a href="#" ... collapse-toggle-if-less768 data-target="#navbar"> ...The custom attribute with Aurelia looks like this:I found that after much struggle, trial and error, the best solution for me on jsfiddle.  Link to inspiration on jsfiddle.net.  I am using bootstrap's navbar navbar-fixed-top with collapse and hamburger toggle.  Here is my version on jsfiddle: jsfiddle Scrollspy navbar.  I was only getting basic functionality using the instructions on getbootsrap.com.  For me, the problem was mostly in the vague directions and js recommended by the getbootstrap site.  The best part was that adding this extra bit of js (which does include some of what is mentioned in the above threads) solved several Scrollspy issues for me including:NOTE:  In the js code shown below (from the second jsfiddle link in my post):topMenu = $("#myScrollspy"),...the value "myScrollspy" must match it the id="" in your HTML like so...Of course you can change that value to whatever value you like.All you need is data-target=".navbar-collapse" in the button, nothing else.This is the code that worked for me:I had the same problem, ensure that bootstrap.js is included in your html page. In my case the menu opened but did not close. As soon as I included the bootstrap js file, everything just worked.Simple Try to make a function in javascript for dropdown collapse class.Example:JS:Hook this function to onClick simple works for me.I had the similar issue but mine wouldn't stay open it would open/close quickly, I found that I had jquery-1.11.1.min.js loading before bootstrap.min.js. So I reversed the order of those 2 files and fixed my menu. Runs flawlessly now. Hope it helpsThe problem could be you are using out of date versions of bootstrap or jquery, OR you are calling more than one version in your markup. Just keep the latest versions, you only need the one reference. Solves the problem.you may want to just ensure you're loading your jQuery and Bootstrap.min.js ATF. Your navigation is the first thing to render on the page, so if you have your scripts in the bottom of your HTML, you're losing any JavaScript functionality.I had the same issue only on mobile but for an Angular application and this is what I did: 

app.component.htmlapp.component.ts

Hope it helps :)My menu is not a navbar standard one, but i managed to auto collapse mine, using an "onclick" function and a ".click()".

Title pretty much sums it up.The external style sheet has the following code:I have tried using:andbut neither works. Is it possible to override an !important style using javascript.This is for a greasemonkey extension, if that makes a difference.I believe the only way to do this it to add the style as a new CSS declaration with the '!important' suffix. The easiest way to do this is to append a new <style> element to the head of document:The rules added with the above method will (if you use the !important suffix) override other previously set styling. If you're not using the suffix then make sure to take concepts like 'specificity' into account.There are a couple of simple one-liners you can use to do this.1) Set a  "style" attribute on the element:or...2) Modify the cssText property of the style object:Either will do the job.===BTW - if you want a useful tool to manipulate !important rules in elements, I've written a jQuery plugin called "important": http://github.com/premasagar/importantelement.style has a setProperty method that can take the priority as a third parameter:It didn't work in old IEs but it should be fine in current browsers.Building on @Premasagar's excellent answer; if you don't want to remove all the other inline styles use this

Can't use removeProperty() because it wont remove !important rules in Chrome.

Can't use element.style[property] = '' because it only accepts camelCase in FireFox.

Better method I just discovered:  try to be more specific than the page CSS with your selectors.  I just had to do this today, and it works like a charm!  More info on the W3C site: http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/cascade.html#specificityIf you want to update / add single style in DOM Element style attribute you can use this function:style.cssText is supported for all major browsers.Use case example:Here is link to demoIf all you are doing is adding css to the page, then I would suggest you use the Stylish addon, and write a user style instead of a user script, because a user style is more efficient and appropriate.See this page with information on how to create a user stylehttps://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/initialuse initial property in css3 https://jsfiddle.net/xk6Ut/256/One option to override CSS class in JavaScript is using an ID for the style element so that we can update the CSS class..Rather than injecting style, if you inject a class(for eg: 'show') through java script, it will work. But here you need css like below. the added class css rule should be below your original rule.There we have another possibilty to remove a property value from the CSS.

Like using the replace method in js. But you have to know exactly the ID of the style, or you can write a for loop to detecting that by(count styles on page, then check if any of those 'includes' or 'match' an "!important" value. & you can count also - how much contains them, or just simply write a global [regexp: /str/gi] replacing method.) Mine is very simple, but i attack a jsBin for example:First i set the body background in css for yellow !impoartant, then i overrided by JS for darkPink.Below is a snippet of code to set the important parameter for the style attribute using jquery.Usage is pretty simple.Just pass an object containing all the attributes you want to set as important.There are two additional options.1.To just add important parameter to already present style attribute pass empty string.2.To add important param for all attributes present dont pass anything. It will set all attributes as important.Here is it live in action. http://codepen.io/agaase/pen/nkvjr

What is the safest way, using media queries, to make something happen when not on a touchscreen device? If there is no way, do you suggest using a JavaScript solution such as !window.Touch or Modernizr?I would suggest using modernizr and using its media query features. However, using CSS, there are pseudo class like, for example in Firefox. You can use :-moz-system-metric(touch-enabled). But these features are not available for every browser. For Apple devices, you can simple use:Especially for Ipad:But, these do not work on Android.Modernizer adds classes to the HTML tag for this exact purpose. In this case, touch and no-touch so you can style your touch related aspects by prefixing your selectors with .touch. e.g. .touch .your-container. Credits: Ben SwinburneThere is actually a property for this in the CSS4 media query draft.This would be used as such:I also found a ticket in the Chromium project related to this.Browser compatibility can be tested at Quirksmode. These are my results (22 jan 2013):The CSS solutions don't appear to be widely available as of mid-2013.  Instead...Media types do not allow you to detect touch capabilities as part of the standard:http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-mediaqueries/So, there is no way to do it consistently via CSS or media queries, you will have to resort to JavaScript.No need to use Modernizr, you can just use plain JavaScript:In 2017, CSS media query from second answer still doesn't work on Firefox. I found a soluton for that: -moz-touch-enabledSo, here is cross-browser media query:There is actually a media query for that: Apart from Firefox, it's fairly well supported. Safari and Chrome being the most common browsers on mobile devices, it might suffice untill greater adoption.This solution will work until CSS4 is globally supported by all browsers. When that day comes just use CSS4. but until then, this works for current browsers. browser-util.jsonload:old way:newer way:The above code will add the "is-touch" class to the body tag if the device has a touch screen. Now any location in your web application where you would have css for :hover you can call body:not(.is-touch) the_rest_of_my_css:hoverfor example:becomes:This solution avoids using modernizer as the modernizer lib is a very big library. If all you're trying to do is detect touch screens, This will be best when the size of the final compiled source is a requirement. This will work.

2013-09-06 02:51:54Z

I want to keep the height of #abc div at 50px and text to align vertically in the middle of the div.You can use line-height: 50px;, you won't need vertical-align: middle; there.DemoThe above will fail if you've multiple lines, so in that case you can wrap your text using span and than use display: table-cell; and display: table; along with vertical-align: middle;, also don't forget to use width: 100%; for #abcDemoAnother solution I can think of here is to use transform property with translateY() where Y obviously stands for Y Axis. It's pretty straight forward... All you need to do is set the elements position to absolute and later position 50% from the top and translate from it's axis with negative -50%DemoNote that this won't be supported on older browsers, for example IE8, but you can make IE9 and other older browser versions of Chrome and Firefox by using -ms, -moz and -webkit prefixes respectively.For more information on transform, you can refer here.It's simple: give the parent div this:and give the child div(s) this:That's it!Old question but nowadays CSS3 makes vertical alignment really simple!Just add to #abc the following css:Simple DemoOriginal question demo updatedSimple Example:I found this solution by Sebastian Ekström.

[Bootstrap 3 Slide in Menu / Navbar on Mobile [closed]](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/20863288/bootstrap-3-slide-in-menu-navbar-on-mobile)

I am building a browser-based mobile app and I've decided to use Bootstrap 3 as the css framework for the design. Bootstrap 3 comes with a great "responsive" feature in the navigation bar where it collapses automatically if it detects a specific "break point" regarding the resolution of the browser. It works in a lot of situations.But have you noticed lately how a lot of browser-based mobile apps have the primary navigation hidden out of the left of the screen, and when the toggle icon is pressed (toggled) in the top-right corner, the primary navigation slides out to the right about 2/3 of the way into the screen? This is an increasingly popular solution for navigating through browser-based apps on mobile devices and I think in theory it should be pretty easy to modify bootstrap css/js to accommodate this version of the navigation collapse feature.How can these feature be implemented? It seems like it shouldn't take too much modification. I'd really like to hear your thoughts/solutions on this matter. Also, I think it would be a great long-term solution for Bootstrap to implement as a built-in feature.Unfortunately I have not made any attempts to create this feature because while I am familiar with these technologies, I am predominantly a PHP/MySQL developer and I believe a feature as useful as this should be built by experts with insight that I don't have as a front-end developer.

The basic idea is to have multiple bordered clusters each containing multiple rows.How about tr {outline: thin solid black;}? Works for me on tr or tbody elements, and appears to be compatible with the most browsers, including IE 8+ but not before.Thank you to all that have responded! I've tried all of the solutions presented here and I've done more searching on the internet for other possible solutions, and I think I've found one that's promising:Output:Instead of having to add the top, bottom, left, and right classes to every <td>, all I have to do is add top row to the top <tr>, bottom row to the bottom <tr>, and row to every <tr> in between. Is there anything wrong with this solution? Are there any cross-platform issues I should be aware of?If you set the border-collapse style to collapse on the parent table you should be able to style the tr:

 (styles are inline for demo) Output:I was just playing around with doing this too, and this seemed to be the best option for me:Note that this will prevent the use of fluid/automatic column widths, as cells will no longer align with those in other rows, but border/colour formatting still works OK. The solution is to give the TR and TDs a specified width (either px or %).Of course you could make the selector tr.myClass if you wanted to apply it only to certain rows.  Apparently display: table doesn't work for IE 6/7, however, but there's probably other hacks (hasLayout?) that might work for those.  :-(Here's an approach using tbody elements that could be the way to do it. You can't set the border on a tbody (same as you can't on a tr) but you can set the background colour. If the effect you're wanting to acheive can be obtained with a background colour on the groups of rows instead of a border this will work.Group rows together using the <tbody> tag and then apply style.And the css in style.cssThe only other way I can think of to do it is to enclose each of the rows you need a border around in a nested table. That will make the border easier to do but will potentially creat other layout issues, you'll have to manually set the width on table cells etc. Your approach may well be the best one depending on your other layout rerquirements and the suggested approach here is just a possible alternative.Based on your requirement that you want to put a border around an arbitrary block of MxN cells there really is no easier way of doing it without using Javascript. If your cells are fixed with you can use floats but this is problematic for other reasons. what you're doing may be tedious but it's fine.Ok, if you're interested in a Javascript solution, using jQuery (my preferred approach), you end up with this fairly scary piece of code:I'll happily take suggestions on easier ways to do this...the trick is with outline property thanks to enigment's answer with little modificationuse this class then in the HTMLand the result is

With Bootstrap class table-striped, every other row in my table has a background colour equal to #F9F9F9. How can I change this colour?change this line in bootstrap.css

or you could use (odd) or (even) instead of (2n+1)Add the following CSS style after loading Bootstrap:You have two options, either you override the styles with a custom stylesheet, or you edit the main bootstrap css file. I prefer the former.Your custom styles should be linked after bootstrap.In custom.cssIf you are using Bootstrap 3, you can use Florin's method, or use a custom CSS file.If you use Bootstrap less source instead of processed css files, you can directly change it in bootstrap/less/variables.less.  Find something like:Use 'even' for change colour of even rows and use 'odd' for change colour of odd rows.I found this checkerboard pattern (as a subset of the zebra stripe) to be a pleasant way to display a two-column table. This is written using LESS CSS, and keys all colors off the base color.Note I've dropped the .table-striped, but doesn't seem to matter.Looks like:

Don't customize your bootstrap CSS by directly editing bootstrap CSS file.Instead, I suggest to  copy paste bootstrap CSS and save them in a different CSS folder and there you can customize or edit stylings suitable to your needs.Delete table-striped 

Its overriding your attempts to change row color.Then do this

In cssIf you want to actually reverse the colors, you should add a rule that makes the "odd" rows white as well as making the "even" rows whatever color you want.

Sometimes it's also useful to use window.innerWidth (not typically found on mobile devices) instead of screen width when dealing with desktop browsers where the window size is often less than the device screen size.Typically, when dealing with mobile devices AND desktop browsers I use the following:One issue with Bryan Rieger's useful answer is that on high-density displays, Apple devices report screen.width in dips, while Android devices report it in physical pixels. (See http://www.quirksmode.org/blog/archives/2012/07/more_about_devi.html .) I suggest using if (window.matchMedia('(max-device-width: 960px)').matches) {} on browsers supporting matchMedia.I just had this idea, so maybe it's shortsighted, but it seems to work well and might be the most consistent between your CSS and JS.In your CSS you set the max-width value for html based on the @media screen value:Then, using JS (probably via a framework like JQuery), you would just check the max-width value of the html tag:Now you can use this value to make conditional changes:If putting the max-width value on the html tag seems scary, then maybe you can put on a different tag, one that is only used for this purpose. For my purpose the html tag works fine and doesn't affect my markup.Useful if you are using Sass, etc: To return a more abstract value, such as breakpoint name, instead of px value you can do something like:Now you can act on same breakpoint names as you do in sass, e.g. sass: @include respond-to(xs), and js if ($breakpoint = "xs) {}.What I especially like about this is that I can define my breakpoint names all in css and in one place (likely a variables scss document) and my js can act on them independently. var width = Math.max(window.screen.width, window.innerWidth);This should handle most scenarios. I think using window.devicePixelRatio is more elegant than the window.matchMedia solution:check it https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/matchMediayou can easily use document.documentElement.clientWidthLumia phones give wrong screen.width (at least on emulator).

So maybe Math.min(window.innerWidth || Infinity, screen.width) will work on all devices?Or something crazier:You should useIt is regarded as cross-browser compability, and is the same method that jQuery(window).width(); uses.For detailed information have a look at: https://ryanve.com/lab/dimensions/Ya mybe u can use document.documentElement.clientWidth to get the device width of client and keep tracking the device width by put on setIntervaljust like Just as an FYI, there is a library called breakpoints which detects the max-width as set in CSS and allows you to use it in JS if-else conditions using <=, <, >, >= and == signs.

We want to cache bust on production deploys, but not waste a bunch of time off the bat figuring out a system for doing so.  My thought was to apply a param to the end of css and js files with the current version number:Two questions:  Will this effectively break the cache?  Will the param cause the browser to then never cache the response from that url since the param indicates that this is dynamic content?The param ?v=1.123 indicates a query string, and the browser will therefore think it is a new path from, say, ?v=1.0. Thus causing it to load from file, not from cache. As you want. And, the browser will assume that the source will stay the same next time you call ?v=1.123 and should cache it with that string. So it will remain cached, however your server is set up, until you move to ?v=1.124 or so on.Yes. Even Stack Overflow use this method, although I remember that they (with their millions of visitors per day and zillions of different client and proxy versions and configurations) have had some freak edge cases where even this was not enough to break the cache. But the general assumption is that this will work, and is a suitable method to break caching on clients.No. The parameter will not change the caching policy; the caching headers sent by the server still apply, and if it doesn't send any, the browser's defaults. It is safer to put the version number in the actual filename.  This allows multiple versions to exist at once so you can roll out a new version and if any cached HTML pages still exist that are requesting the older version, they will get the version that works with their HTML.Note, in one of the largest versioned deployments anywhere on the internet, jQuery uses version numbers in the actual filename and it safely allows multiple versions to co-exist without any special server-side logic (each version is just a different file).This busts the cache once when you deploy new pages and new linked files (which is what you want) and from then on those versions can be effectively cached (which you also want).As others have said, cache busting with a query param is usually considered a Bad Idea (tm), and has been for a long time. It's better to reflect the version in the file name. Html5 Boilerplate recommends against using the query string, among others.That said, of the recommendations I have seen which cited a source, all seem to take their wisdom from a 2008 article by Steve Souders. His conclusions are based on the behaviour of proxies at the time, and they may or may not be relevant these days. Still, in the absence of more current information, changing the file name is the safe option.It will bust the cache once, after the client has downloaded the resource every other response will be served from client cache unless:In general this should be fine, but it's possible for this to not work if there is an intermediate cache (a proxy) that is configured to ignore the request parameters.For example, if you are serving static content through Akamai CDN, it can be configured to ignore request parameters to prevent cache busting using this method.It very much depends on quite how robust you want your caching to be. For example, the squid proxy server (and possibly others) defaults to not caching URLs served with a querystring - at least, it did when that article was written. If you don't mind certain use cases causing unnecessary cache misses, then go ahead with query params. But it's very easy to set up a filename-based cache-busting scheme which avoids this problem.Found a comparison of the 2 techniques (query string vs file name) here: Version as a querystring has two problems. Another similar approach is to use htaccess mod_rewrite to ignore part of the path when serving the files. Your never-cached index page references the latest path to the files. From a development perspective it's as easy as using params for the version number, but it's as robust as the filename approach.Use the ignored part of the path for the version number, and the server just ignores it and serves the uncached file.  1.2.3/css/styles.css serves the same file as css/styles.css since the first directory is stripped and ignored by the htaccess fileNote that this approach means you need to disable caching of your index page - Using <meta> tags to turn off caching in all browsers?You could take the same approach on any server platform that allows url rewriting(rewrite condition adapted from mod_rewrite - rewrite directory to query string except /#!/)... and if you need cache busting for your index page / site entry point, you could always use JavaSript to refresh it. Hope this should help you to inject external JS fileSource - Cachebuster code in JavaScript

I'd use this as anecdotal evidence to say 'go ahead, implement it'.Some JavaScript code to do it, using Prototype (because that's what I'm familiar with):PS: Obviously this JavaScript code is very naive and not well tested, and you probably don't want to use it on textboxes with novels in them, but you get the general idea.One refinement to some of these answers is to let CSS do more of the work.The basic route seems to be:Here's another technique for autosizing a textarea.Code:

(plain vanilla JavaScript)Demo:

(uses jQuery, targets on the textarea I'm typing into right now - if you have Firebug installed, paste both samples into the console and test on this page)Probably the shortest solution:This way you don't need any hidden divs or anything like that.Note: you might have to play with this.style.height = (this.scrollHeight) + "px"; depending on how you style the textarea (line-height, padding and that kind of stuff).Here's a Prototype version of resizing a text area that is not dependent on the number of columns in the textarea. This is a superior technique because it allows you to control the text area via CSS as well as have variable width textarea. Additionally, this version displays the number of characters remaining. While not requested, it's a pretty useful feature and is easily removed if unwanted.Create the widget by calling new Widget.Textarea('element_id'). The default options can be overridden by passing them as an object, e.g. new Widget.Textarea('element_id', { max_length: 600, min_height: 50}). If you want to create it for all textareas on the page, do something like:Here is a solution with JQuery:abc is a teaxtarea.Check the below link:

http://james.padolsey.com/javascript/jquery-plugin-autoresize/Just revisiting this, I've made it a little bit tidier (though someone who is full bottle on Prototype/JavaScript could suggest improvements?).Just it call with:I've made something quite easy. First I put the TextArea into a DIV. Second, I've called on the ready function to this script.Simple. It is the maximum height of the div once it is rendered, divided by the height of one TextArea of one row.I needed this function for myself, but none of the ones from here worked as I needed them.So I used Orion's code and changed it.I added in a minimum height, so that on the destruct it does not get too small.Like the answer of @memical.However I found some improvements. You can use the jQuery height() function. But be aware of padding-top and padding-bottom pixels. Otherwise your textarea will grow too fast.My solution not using jQuery (because sometimes they don't have to be the same thing) is below. Though it was only tested in Internet Explorer 7, so the community can point out all the reasons this is wrong:So far I really like how it's working, and I don't care about other browsers, so I'll probably apply it to all my textareas:Here is an extension to the Prototype widget that Jeremy posted on June 4th:It stops the user from entering more characters if you're using limits in textareas. It checks if there are characters left. If the user copies text into the textarea, the text is cut off at the max. length:@memical had an awesome solution for setting the height of the textarea on pageload with jQuery, but for my application I wanted to be able to increase the height of the textarea as the user added more content.  I built off memical's solution with the following:It's not very smooth but it's also not a client-facing application, so smoothness doesn't really matter.  (Had this been client-facing, I probably would have just used an auto-resize jQuery plugin.)For those that are coding for IE and encounter this problem. IE has a little trick that makes it 100% CSS.You can even provide a value for rows="n" which IE will ignore, but other browsers will use. I really hate coding that implements IE hacks, but this one is very helpful. It is possible that it only works in Quirks mode.Internet Explorer, Safari, Chrome and Opera users need to remember to explicidly set the line-height value in CSS. I do a stylesheet that sets the initial properites for all text boxes as follows.Here is a function I just wrote in jQuery to do it - you can port it to Prototype, but they don't support the "liveness" of jQuery so elements added by Ajax requests will not respond.This version not only expands, but it also contracts when delete or backspace is pressed.This version relies on jQuery 1.4.2.Enjoy ;)http://pastebin.com/SUKeBtnxUsage:or (any jQuery selector for example)It was tested on Internet Explorer 7/Internet Explorer 8, Firefox 3.5, and Chrome.

There were some other posts about people experiencing a similar issue with 3d transforms, but can't find anything about 2d transforms like this.Any ideas would be appreciated, thanks!I have have this problem a number of times and there seems to be 2 ways of fixing it (shown below). You can use either of these properties to fix the rendering, or both at the same time.Backface visibility hidden fixes the problem as it simplifies the animation to just the front of the object, whereas the default state is the front and the back.TranslateZ also works as it is a hack to add hardware acceleration to the animation. Both of these properties fix the problem that you are having but some people also like to add to their animated to object. I find that it can change the rendering of a web font but feel free to experiment with that method too.To improve the blurriness, esp. on Chrome, try doing this:UPDATE: Perspective adds distance between the user and the z-plane, which technically scales the object, making the blurriness seem 'permanent'. The perspective(1px) above is like duck-tape because we're matching the blurriness we're trying to solve. You might have better luck with the css below:I found that adjusting the scale ratio helped slightly.Using scale(1.048) over (1.05) seemed to generate a better approximation to a whole-pixel font size, reducing the sub-pixel blurring.I also used translateZ(0) which seems to adjust Chrome's final rounding step in the transform animation. This is a plus for my onhover usage because it increases speed and reduces visual noise. For an onclick function however, I wouldn't use it because, the transformed font doesn't appear to be as crispy.Instead of using fixes the text blurring problem in Chrome.After trying everything else here with no luck, what finally fixed this issue for me was removing the will-change: transform; property. For some reason it caused horribly blurry looking scaling in Chrome, but not Firefox.Sunderls lead me to the answer. Except filter: scale does not exist, but filter: blur does. Apply the next declarations to the elements that appear blurred (in my case they were inside a transformed element): It almost worked perfectly. "Almost" because i'm using a transition and while in transition, elements don't look perfect, but once the transition is done, they do. This must be a bug with Chrome (Version 56.0.2924.87), but the below fixes the bluriness for me when changing css properties in the console('.0'). I'll report it.I found out, that the problem occures on relative transforms in any way. translateX(50%), scale(1.1) or what ever. providing absolute values always works (does not produce blurry text(ures)).None of the solutions mentions here worked, and I think there is not solution, yet (using Chrome 62.0.3202.94 while I am writing this).In my case transform: translateY(-50%) translateX(-50%) causes the blur (I want to center a dialog).To reach a bit more "absolute" values, I had to set decimal values to transform: translateY(-50.09%) translateX(-50.09%).NOTEI am quite sure, that this values vary on different screen sizes. I just wanted to share my experiences, in case it helps someone. Try using zoom: 101%; for complex designs when you can't use a combination of zoom + scale.In my case following code caused blurry font:and just adding zoom property fixed it for me. Play around with zoom, following worked for me:Another fix to try i just found for blurry transforms (translate3d, scaleX) on Chrome is to set the element as 

"display: inline-table;". 

It seems to force pixel rounding in some case (on the X axis).I read subpixel positioning under Chrome was intended and devs won't fix it.Adding perspective(1px) worked for me.toI have found a much better and clean solution:orThanks to this post:

Preventing blurry rendering with transform: scale2019 UpdateThe Chrome display bug is still unfixed and though no fault of the patrons, none of the suggestions offered in the entirety of this website help to resolve the issue. I can concur that I have tried every single one of them in vain: only 1 comes close and that's the css rule: filter:blur(0); which eliminates the shifting of a container by 1px but does not resolve the blurred display bug of the container itself and any content it may have.Here's the reality: there literally is no fix to this problem so here is a work around for fluid websitesCASE

I'm currently developing a fluid website and have 3 divs, all centered with hover effects and sharing percentage values in both the width and position. The Chrome bug occurs on the center container which is set to left:50%; and transform:translateX(-50%); a common setting.EXAMPLE: First the HTML...Here's the CSS where the Chrome bug occurs...Here's the fixed css...Bugged fiddle: https://jsfiddle.net/m9bgrunx/2/

Fixed fiddle: https://jsfiddle.net/uoc6e2dm/2/As you can see a small amount of tweaking to the CSS should reduce or eliminate the requirement to use transform for positioning. This could also apply to fixed width websites as well as fluid.I have this same problem. I fixed this using:None of above worked for me.

I had this animation for popups:In my case blurry effect was gone after applying this rule:

-webkit-perspective: 1000; even though it is marked as unused in Chrome inspector.None of the above worked for me.It worked when I added perspectiveie from transform : translate3d(-10px,-20px,0) scale3d(0.7,0.7, 1)i changed to transform : perspective(1px) translate3d(-10px,-20px,0) scale3d(0.7,0.7, 1)I fixed my case by adding:FOR CHORME:I´ve tried all suggestions here. But diden't work.

My college found a great solution, that works better:You should NOT scale past 1.0And include translateZ(0) in the hover but NOT in the none-hover/initial position.Example:I used a combination of all answers and this is what worked for me in the end:For me the problem was that my elements were using transformStyle: preserve-3d. I realized that this wasn't actually needed for the app and removing it fixed the blurriness.I removed this from my code -  transform-style: preserve-3d;

and added this- transform: perspective(1px) translateZ(0);the blur went away!In Chrome 74.0.3729.169, current as of 5-25-19, there doesn't seem to be any fix for blurring occurring at certain browser zoom levels caused by the transform. Even a simple TransformY(50px) will blur the element. This doesn't occur in current versions of Firefox, Edge or Safari, and it doesn't seem to occur at all zoom levels.My solution was:display: initial;Then it was crispy sharp you can use css filter to fix this.about vendor-prefix, please do it by yourself.-webkit-filter,-ms-filter.

detail is here

http://browser.colla.me/show/css_transformation_scale_cause_blurringThe text won't be blurry if you don't transition the transform.Just do this:Without the transition like

    transition: all .2s;It's important to add that this issue arises if the element which is being translated has a height with an odd number of pixels. So, if you have control over the height of the element, setting it to an even number will make the content appear crisp

Save your HTML clean.So try wrapping the content in a div, and give the div a min-height

jsFiddle hereif you set style="height:100px;" on a td if the td has content that grows the cell more than that, it will do so no need for min height on a td.Tables and table cells don't use the min-height property, setting their height will be the min-height as tables will expand if the content stretches them.Simply use the css entry of min-height to one of the cells of your table row. Works on old browsers too.

http://jsfiddle.net/NQAzt/DISCLAIMER: overlay has been deprecated.

You can still use this if you absolutely have to, but try not to.This only works on WebKit browsers, but I like it a lot.

Will behave like auto on other browsers.This will make the scrollbar appear only as an overlay, thus not affecting the width of your element!All you need to do is add:In your css file as this will have the scroller whether it is needed or not though you just won't be able to scrollThis means that the viewport will have the same width for bothProbablyis just what you want.Webkit browsers like Safari and Chrome subtract the scroll bar width from the visible page width when calculating width: 100% or 100vw. More at DM Rutherford's Scrolling and Page Width.Try using overflow-y: overlay instead.I found I could adddirectly to my css and it would make the scrollbar invisible, but still allow me to scroll (on Chrome at least).  Good for when you don't want a distracting scrollbar on your page!It doesn't seem my other answer is working quite right at the moment (but I'll continue to try to get it operational).But basically what you'll need to do, and what it was trying to do dynamically, is set the contents' width to slightly less than that of the parent, scrollable pane.

So that when the scrollbar appears it has no affect on the content.This EXAMPLE shows a more hacky way of attaining that goal, by hardcoding widths instead of trying to get the browser to do it for us via padding.

If this is feasible this is the most simplest solution if you don't want a permanent scrollbar.For containers with a fixed width a pure CSS cross browser solution can be accomplished by wrapping the container into another div and applying the same width to both divs.Click here to see an example on CodepenEDIT: this answer isn't quite right at the moment, refer to my other answer to see what I was attempting to do here. I'm trying to fix it up, but if you can offer assistance do so in the comments, thanks!Using padding-right will mitigate the sudden appearance of a scrollbarEXAMPLEAs you can see from the dots, the text makes it to the same point in the page before wrapping, regardless of whether or not a scrollbar is present.

This is because when a scrollbar is introduced the padding hides behind it, so the scrollbar doesn't push on the text!where 300 px is a half of my dialog window width.This is actually the only thing that worked for me.I had the same issue on Chrome.

I'm trying to inspect CSS properties from an input into a table cell. The input appears on click and disappears on lost focus, as when I try to inspect it.

How can I do it to don't lost focus while I move to another window (the inspector)?

2015-03-10 12:05:35Z

I'm trying to inspect CSS properties from an input into a table cell. The input appears on click and disappears on lost focus, as when I try to inspect it.

How can I do it to don't lost focus while I move to another window (the inspector)?In Chrome browser, open Developer Tools and select Elements tab, then

open the contextual menu of the parent node of the element you want to inspect, in the contextual menu click on Break on > Subtree modifications.Afterwards you just need to click on the page and you'll get on the inspector without losing focus or losing the element you want to inspect.You can capture the disappearing element if you pause JavaScript execution with a keyboard shortcut without moving the mouse. Here's how you do this in Chrome:This trick works in Firefox and other modern browsers as well.If all else fails, type this in the Console:Then you've got 5 seconds (or change the value to anything else) to make whatever you want to debug appear.None of the other answers worked for me - the DOM tree kept getting modified (i.e. stuff I care about disappeared) right before the script paused.Not sure if this works in your situation but normally (and in every case worth to mention in this regard as it is a great tool) in Chrome Developer Tools you can simulate element states and one is also :focus.To do so go to the Elements tab in the Developer Tools and make sure you are in the Styles section on the right (this should be the default location when you start the Developer Tools). Now just beneth the Styles in the top right corner you have an icon Toggle Element State. When you click it you can simulate :active, :hover, :focus and :visited for the element you selected on the left in your code view.In Chrome on the developer tools page for the page under test... click the options menu and open settings for preferences... under DevTools enable 'Emulate a focused page'Then in the test page cause the elements to appear. This worked to keep my popup search results is focused to stay on the screen so I could work with it.Not a real solution, but it usually works (:Paste the following Javascript in the browser developer console:I had a very difficult situation and no answer was working from here (I didn't verify the answers changing the container, which is the body for me, or the original event, because I don't know that). I finally found a workaround by breaking via the Control Event Listener Breakpoints in Chrome Inspector. Maybe that is also a cross browser way of breaking for complicated situations where even F8 or right clicking mouse hide the popup again:I have a quicker fix since I'm not very good with using tools, here's what i do.

Is it possible to control the length and distance between dashed border strokes in CSS?This example below displays differently between browsers:Big differences: IE 11 / Firefox / ChromeAre there any methods that can provide greater control of the dashed borders appearance?Css render is browser specific and I don't know any fine tuning on it, you should work with images as recommended by Ham.

Reference: http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/box.html#border-style-propertiesThe native dashed border property value does not offer control over the dashes themselves... so bring on the border-image property! Compatibility: It offers great browser support (IE 11 and all modern browsers). A normal border can be set as a fallback for older browsers.These borders will display exactly the same cross-browser! This example is 15 pixels wide by 15 pixels high and the gaps are currently 5px wide.  It is a .png with transparency.This is what it looks like in photoshop when zoomed in:This is what it looks like to scale:To create wider / shorter gaps or strokes, widen / shorten the gaps or strokes in the image.Here is an image with wider 10px gaps: correctly scaled = Writing shorthandThe properties above can be set individually, or in shorthand using border-image:Note the border: dashed 4px #000 fallback. Non-supporting browsers will receive this border.In addition to the border-image property, there are a few other ways to create a dashed border with control over the length of the stroke and the distance between them. They are described below:We can create the dashed border by using a path or a polygon element and setting the stroke-dasharray property. The property takes two parameters where one defines the size of the dash and the other determines the space between them.Pros:Cons:We can use multiple linear-gradient background images and position them appropriately to create a dashed border effect. This can also be done with a repeating-linear-gradient but there is not much improvement because of using a repeating gradient as we need each gradient to repeat in only one direction.Pros:Cons:We can create a small bar (in the shape of the dash) using pseudo-elements and then create multiple box-shadow versions of it to create a border like in the below snippet. If the dash is a square shape then a single pseudo-element would be enough but if it is a rectangle, we would need one pseudo-element for the top + bottom borders and another for left + right borders. This is because the height and width for the dash on the top border will be different from that on the left.Pros:Cons:Short one: No, it's not. You will have to work with images instead.Stroke length depends on stroke width. You can increase length by increasing width and hide part of border by inner element.https://jsfiddle.net/ok6srt2z/This will make an orange and gray border using the class="myclass" on the div.I just recently had the same problem. I managed to solve it with two absolutely positioned divs carrying the border (one for horizontal and one for vertical), and then transforming them.

The outer box just needs to be relatively positioned.Note: i used tachyons in this example, but i guess the classes are kind of self-explanatory.

I want my container div to get the height of max of its children's height. without knowing what height the child divs are going to have. I was trying out on JSFiddle. The container div is on red. which is not showing up. Why?Add the following property:This will force the container to respect the height of all elements within it, regardless of floating elements.

http://jsfiddle.net/gtdfY/3/Recently, I was working on a project that required this trick, but needed to allow overflow to show, so instead, you can use a pseudo-element to clear your floats, effectively achieving the same effect while allowing overflow on all elements.http://jsfiddle.net/gtdfY/368/You are floating the children which means they "float" in front of the container.

In order to take the correct height, you must "clear" the floatThe div style="clear: both" clears the floating an gives the correct height to the container. see http://css.maxdesign.com.au/floatutorial/clear.htm for more info on floats.eg.It is not that easier?Try inserting this clearing div before the last </div><div style="clear: both; line-height: 0;">&nbsp;</div>The best and the most bulletproof solution is to add ::before and ::after pseudoelements to the container. So if you have for example a list like:And every elements in the list has float:left property, then you should add to your css:Or you could try display:inline-block; property, then you don't need to add any clearfix.

This means it can align items along horizontal OR vertical lines. A flex item is confined to its row or column.A true grid system is two-dimensional, meaning it can align items along horizontal AND vertical lines. Content items can span across rows and columns simultaneously, which flex items cannot do.This is why flexbox has a limited capacity for building grids. It's also a reason why the W3C has developed another CSS3 technology, Grid Layout.In a flex container with flex-flow: row wrap, flex items must wrap to new rows.This means that a flex item cannot wrap under another item in the same row.Notice above how div #3 wraps below div #1, creating a new row. It cannot wrap beneath div #2.As a result, when items aren't the tallest in the row, white space remains, creating unsightly gaps.If you switch to flex-flow: column wrap, a grid-like layout is more attainable. However, a column-direction container has four potential problems right off the bat:As a result, a column-direction container is not an option in this case, and in many other cases.Grid Layout would be a perfect solution to your problem if the various heights of the content items could be pre-determined. All other requirements are well within Grid's capacity.The width and height of grid items must be known in order to close gaps with surrounding items.So Grid, which is the best CSS has to offer for building a horizontally-flowing masonry layout, falls short in this case.In fact, until a CSS technology arrives with the ability to automatically close the gaps, CSS in general has no solution. Something like this would probably require reflowing the document, so I'm not sure how useful or efficient it would be.You'll need a script.JavaScript solutions tend to use absolute positioning, which removes content items from the document flow in order to re-arrange them with no gaps. Here are two examples:For layouts where the width and height of content items are known, here's a horizontally-flowing masonry layout in pure CSS:How it worksBrowser Support for CSS GridHere's the complete picture: http://caniuse.com/#search=gridCool grid overlay feature in FirefoxIn Firefox dev tools, when you inspect the grid container, there is a tiny grid icon in the CSS declaration.

I'm learning some CSS to tweak my project template. I come to this problem and didn't find a clear answer on the web. Is there a difference between using @import or link in CSS?Use of @importUse of LinkWhat's the best way to do it? and why?

Thanks!In theory, the only difference between them is that @import is the CSS mechanism to include a style sheet and <link> the HTML mechanism. However, browsers handle them differently, giving <link> a clear advantage in terms of performance.Steve Souders wrote an extensive blog post comparing the impact of both <link> and @import (and all sorts of combinations of them) called "don’t use @import". That title pretty much speaks for itself.Yahoo! also mentions it as one of their performance best practices (co-authored by Steve Souders): Choose <link> over @importAlso, using the <link> tag allows you to define "preferred" and alternate stylesheets. You can't do that with @import.You can use the import command to import another CSS inside a css file which is not possible with the link command. Really old browser cannot (IE4, IE5 partially) handle the import functionality. Additionally some libraries parsing your xhtml/html could fail in getting the style sheet import. Please be aware that your import should come before all other CSS declarations.No real difference today, but @import is not handled correctly by older browsers (Netscape 4, etc.), so the @import hack can be used to hide CSS 2 rules from these old browsers.Again, unless you're supporting really old browsers, there isn't a difference.If I were you, however, I'd use the <link> variant on your HTML pages, because it allows you to specify things like media type (print, screen, etc.).The <link> directive can allow for multiple css be loaded and interpreted asyncronously.the @import directive forces the browser* to wait until the imported script is loaded inline to the parent script before it can be correctly processed by it's engine, since technically it is just one script.A lot of css minimization scripts (and languages like less or sass) will automatically concatenate linked scripts into the main script since it ends up causing less transfer overhead.* (depends on the browser)This article may be of use here: 4 methods of adding CSS to HTML: link, embed, inline and importWhen I use the @import rule, it's generally to import a stylesheet within an existing stylesheet (although I dislike doing it to begin with). But to answer your question, no I don't believe there's any difference. Just make sure to put the URL in double quotes in order to comply with valid XHTML.@import is generally meant to be used in an external stylesheet rather than inline like in your example. If you really wanted to hide a stylesheet from very old browsers you could use that as a hack to prevent them from using that stylesheet. Overall, the <link> tag is processed more quickly than the @import rule (which is apparently somewhat slow as far as the css processing engine is concerned).Microsoft Internet Explorer 9 (MSIE9) doesn't seem to handle @import properly.  Observe these entries from my Apache log (IP address hidden but whois said it was owned by Microsoft itself): the main HTML linked to screen.css which hadwhich I am now about to change to link elements in the HTML, because it seems MSIE9 issues two incorrect requests to the server, getting 404 errors I could do without:There were proper requests for these files afterwards, but we can do without this "shoot at server first, parse url after" logic.

Flexbox Not Centering Vertically in IE

I have a simple web page with some Lipsum content that is centered on the page. The page works fine in Chrome and Firefox. If I reduce the size of the window, the content fills the window until it can't and then adds a scroll bar and fills content off screen, toward the bottom. However, the page doesn't center in IE11. I can get the page to center in IE by flexing the body, but if I do, then the content starts to go off screen towards the top and cuts off the top of the content.Below are the two scenarios. See the associated Fiddles. If the problem isn't evident right away, reduce the size of the result window so that it's forced to generate a scroll bar.Note: This application only targets the latest versions of Firefox, Chrome and IE (IE11), which all have support for the Candidate Recommendation of Flexbox, so feature compatibility shouldn't be an issue (in theory).Edit: When using the Fullscreen API to fullscreen the outer div, all browsers correctly center using the original CSS. However, upon leaving the fullscreen mode, IE reverts back to being horizontally centered and vertically top aligned. Edit: IE11 uses non-vendor specific implementation of Flexbox.

I have a simple web page with some Lipsum content that is centered on the page. The page works fine in Chrome and Firefox. If I reduce the size of the window, the content fills the window until it can't and then adds a scroll bar and fills content off screen, toward the bottom. However, the page doesn't center in IE11. I can get the page to center in IE by flexing the body, but if I do, then the content starts to go off screen towards the top and cuts off the top of the content.Below are the two scenarios. See the associated Fiddles. If the problem isn't evident right away, reduce the size of the result window so that it's forced to generate a scroll bar.Note: This application only targets the latest versions of Firefox, Chrome and IE (IE11), which all have support for the Candidate Recommendation of Flexbox, so feature compatibility shouldn't be an issue (in theory).Edit: When using the Fullscreen API to fullscreen the outer div, all browsers correctly center using the original CSS. However, upon leaving the fullscreen mode, IE reverts back to being horizontally centered and vertically top aligned. Edit: IE11 uses non-vendor specific implementation of Flexbox.

What I did was to add height style with some value and that fix the issue for me.for example : So now we have height style, but the min-height will overwrite it. That way ie is happy and we still can use min-height.Hope this is helpful for someone.Try wrapping whatever div you have flexboxed with flex-direction: column in a container that is also flexboxed.I just tested this in IE11 and it works. An odd fix, but until Microsoft makes their internal bug fix external...it'll have to do!HTML:CSS:2 examples for you to test in IE11:

http://codepen.io/chriswrightdesign/pen/emQNGZ/Here is my working solution (SCSS):Just in case someone gets here with the same issue I had, which is not specifically addressed in previous comments.I had margin: auto on the inner element which caused it to stick to the bottom of it's parent (or the outer element).

What fixed it for me was changing the margin to margin: 0 auto;.This is a known bug that appears to have been fixed internally at Microsoft.https://connect.microsoft.com/IE/feedback/details/802625/min-height-and-flexbox-flex-direction-column-dont-work-together-in-ie-10-11-previewi have updated both fiddles. i hope it will make your work done.centeringcenter and scrollThe original answer from https://github.com/philipwalton/flexbugs/issues/231#issuecomment-362790042I don't have much experience with Flexbox but it seems to me that the forced height on the html and body tags cause the text to disappear on top when resized-- I wasn't able to test in IE but I found the same effect in Chrome.I forked your fiddle and removed the height and width declarations.It also seemed like the flex settings must be applied to other flex elements. However, applying display: flex to the .inner caused issues so I explicitly set the .inner to display: block and set the .outer to flex for positioning.I set the minimum .outer height to fill the viewport, the display: flex, and set the horizontal and vertical alignment:I set .inner to display: block explicitly. In Chrome, it looked like it inherited flex from .outer. I also set the width:This fixed the issue in Chrome, hopefully it might do the same in IE11. Here's my version of the fiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/ToddT/5CxAy/21/Found a good solution what worked for me, check this link https://codepen.io/chriswrightdesign/pen/emQNGZ/?editors=1100

First, we add a parent div, second we change min-height:100% to min-height:100vh. It works like a charm.If you can define the parent's width and height, there's a simpler way to centralize the image without having to create a container for it.For some reason, if you define the min-width, IE will recognize max-width as well.This solution works for IE10+, Firefox and Chrome.https://jsfiddle.net/HumbertoMendes/t13dzsmn/

when click somewhere else the border disappears, tried onfocus none, but didn't help, how to make ugly button border disappear when click on?using outline:none; we can remove that border in chrome DemoP.S:It works for me simply :)This one worked for meThe outline property is what you need. It's shorthand for setting each of the following properties in a single declaration:You could use outline: none;, which is suggested in the accepted answer. You could also be more specific if you wanted:add !important if it is used in BootstrapTo avoid the problem caused when you change the outline property on a focus, is tho give a visual effect when the user Tab on the input button or click on it.In this case is a submit type, but you can apply to a type="button" too.Given the html below: In the css style do the following:This code will remove button border and will disable button border focus when the button is clicked.As many others have mentioned, selector:focus {outline: none;} will remove that border but that border is a key accessibility feature that allows for keyboard users to find the button and shouldn't be removed.Since your concern seems to be an aesthetic one, you should know that you can change the color, style, and width of the outline, making it fit into your site styling better.Shorthand:It's greatly simple than you think. When the button is focussed, apply the outline property, like this:But when I use none value, it doesn't work for me.Removing nessorry accessible event not a good idea in up to standard web developments.

either way if you looking for a solution removing just the outline doesn't solve the problem. you also have to remove the blue color shadow. for specific scenarios use a separate class name to isolate the this special style to your button.Better do thisRemoving the outline is an accessibility nightmare. People tabbing using keyboards will never know what item they're on.Best to leave it, as most clicked buttons will take you somewhere anyway, or if you HAVE to remove the outline then isolate it a specific class name.Then you can apply that class whenever you need to.

Is there a way to select every nth child that matches (or does not match) an arbitrary selector?  For example, I want to select every odd table row, but within a subset of the rows:But :nth-child() just seems to count all the tr elements regardless of whether or not they're of the "row" class, so I end up with the one even "row" element instead of the two I'm looking for. The same thing happens with :nth-of-type().Can someone explain why?This is a very common problem that arises due to a misunderstanding of how :nth-child() and :nth-of-type() work. Unfortunately, there is currently no selector-based solution as yet because Selectors does not provide a way to match the nth child that matches an arbitrary selector based on a pattern such as odd-numbered, even-numbered or any an+b where a != 1 and b != 0. This extends beyond just class selectors, to attribute selectors, negations, and more complex combinations of simple selectors.The :nth-child() pseudo-class counts elements among all of their siblings under the same parent. It does not count only the siblings that match the rest of the selector. Similarly, the :nth-of-type() pseudo-class counts siblings sharing the same element type, which refers to the tag name in HTML, and not the rest of the selector.This also means that if all the children of the same parent are of the same element type, for example in the case of a table body whose only children are tr elements or a list element whose only children are li elements, then :nth-child() and :nth-of-type() will behave identically, i.e. for every value of an+b, :nth-child(an+b) and :nth-of-type(an+b) will match the same set of elements.In fact, all simple selectors in a given compound selector, including pseudo-classes such as :nth-child() and :not(), work independently of one another, rather than looking at the subset of elements that are matched by the rest of the selector.This also implies that there is no notion of order among simple selectors within each individual compound selector1, which means for example the following two selectors are equivalent:Translated to English, they both mean:(you'll notice my use of an unordered list here, just to drive the point home)Because there is currently no pure CSS solution, you'll have to use a script to filter elements and apply styles or extra class names accordingly. For example, the following is a common workaround using jQuery (assuming there is only one row group populated with tr elements within the table):With the corresponding CSS:If you're using automated testing tools such as Selenium or processing HTML with tools like lxml, many of these tools allow XPath as an alternative:Other solutions using different technologies are left as an exercise to the reader; this is just a brief, contrived example for illustration.For what it's worth, there is a proposal for an extension to the :nth-child() notation to be added to Selectors level 4 for the specific purpose of selecting every nth child matching a given selector.2The selector by which to filter matches is provided as an argument to :nth-child(), again due to how selectors operate independently of one another in a sequence as dictated by the existing selector syntax. So in your case, it would look like this:(An astute reader will note right away that this ought to be :nth-child(odd of tr.row) instead, since the simple selectors tr and :nth-child() operate independently of one another as well. This is one of the problems with functional pseudo-classes that accept selectors, a can of worms I'd rather not open in the middle of this answer. Instead I'm going to go with the assumption that most sites will not have any other elements than tr elements as siblings of one another in a table body, which would make either option functionally equivalent.)Of course, being a brand new proposal in a brand new specification, this probably won't see implementation until a few years down the road. In the meantime, you'll have to stick with using a script, as above.1 If you specify a type or universal selector, it must come first. This does not change how selectors fundamentally work, however; it's nothing more than a syntactic quirk.2 This was originally proposed as :nth-match(), however because it still counts an element relative only to its siblings, and not to every other element that matches the given selector, it has since as of 2014 been repurposed as an extension to the existing :nth-child() instead.Not really..quote from the docsIt is a selector of its own and does not combine with classes. In your rule it just has to satisfy both selector at the same time, so it will show the :nth-child(even) table rows if they also happen to have the .row class.nth-of-type works according to the index of same type of the element but nth-child works only according to index no matter what type of siblings elements are.For exampleSuppose in above html we want to hide all the elements having rest class.In this case nth-child and nth-of-type will work exactly same as all the element are of same type that is <div> so css should beORNow you must be wondering what is the difference between nth-child and nth-of-type so this is the differenceSuppose the html is In the above html the type of .rest element is different from others .rest are paragraphs and others are div so in this case if you use nth-child you have to write like thisbut if you use nth-of-type css can be thisYou may be able to do that with xpath. something like //tr[contains(@class, 'row') and position() mod 2 = 0] might work. There are other SO questions expanding on the details how to match classes more precisely.Here is your answerAll of the questions around using nth-child and skipping hidden tags appear to be redirecting as dupes of this one so I will leave this here. I came across this blog https://blog.blackbam.at/2015/04/09/css-nth-child-selector-ignore-hidden-element/ that uses a clever css approach to make nth-child ignore hidden elements, as follows:The following CSS adds a margin right to every second visible element no matter which element has the cpw class.Hope that helps someone who is following the dupe trail for the ignore hidden elements questions!

What does the double colon (::) mean in CSS?For example:

2013-05-23 01:04:31Z

What does the double colon (::) mean in CSS?For example:It means pseudo element selector. It means the element to the right doesn't exist in the normal DOM, but can be selected.SourceIt was originally only a single colon, but was changed to differentiate it from pseudo classes (like :hover, :first-child, :not etc). It's best to use : for before and after pseudo elements since the single colon has better browser support, namely in earlier IE versions.The :: operator indicates you are selecting a pseudo element, one which does not actually exist as an element but can still be targeted for styling.Example of this include several vendor-specific implementations such as the -ms-clear sample you provide, most browsers also have pseudo elements to style scroll bars and other native UI elements, but there are also a lot of predefined pseudo elements which can be referenced for practical reasons, such as first-line and first-letter.The :before and :after pseudo elements even allow you to insert actual content into the page using CSS with the content rule.CSS3 changes the way pseudo-elements are selected, as the W3C wanted to distinguish pseudo-classes like a:visited from pseudo-elements like p::first-line.

Styling Google Maps InfoWindow

[Styling Google Maps InfoWindow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5634991/styling-google-maps-infowindow)

I've been attempting to style my Google Maps InfoWindow, but the documentation is very limited on this topic. How do you style an InfoWindow?

2011-04-12 12:13:12Z

I've been attempting to style my Google Maps InfoWindow, but the documentation is very limited on this topic. How do you style an InfoWindow?Google wrote some code to assist with this. Here are some examples: Example using InfoBubble, Styled markers and Info Window Custom (using OverlayView).The code in the links above take different routes to achieve similar results. The gist of it is that it is not easy to style InfoWindows directly, and it might be easier to use the additional InfoBubble class instead of InfoWindow, or to override GOverlay. Another option would be to modify the elements of the InfoWindow using javascript (or jQuery), like later ATOzTOA suggested. Possibly the simplest of these examples is using InfoBubble instead of InfoWindow. InfoBubble is available by importing this file (which you should host yourself): http://google-maps-utility-library-v3.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/infobubble/src/infobubble.jsInfoBubble's Github project page.InfoBubble is very stylable, compared to InfoWindow:You can also call it with a given map and marker to open on:As another example, the Info Window Custom example extends the GOverlay class from the Google Maps API and uses this as a base for creating a more flexible info window. It first creates the class:after which it proceeds to override GOverlay:You should then override the methods you need: createElement, draw, remove and panMap. It gets rather involved, but in theory you are just drawing a div on the map yourself now, instead of using a normal Info Window.You can modify the whole InfoWindow using jquery alone...Here the <p> element will act as a hook into the actual InfoWindow. Once the domready fires, the element will become active and accessible using javascript/jquery, like $('#hook').parent().parent().parent().parent().The below code just sets a 2 pixel border around the InfoWindow.You can do anything like setting a new CSS class or just adding a new element.Play around with the elements to get what you need...//CSS put in stylesheetI used the following code to apply some external CSS:Use the InfoBox plugin from the Google Maps Utility Library. It makes styling/managing map pop-ups much easier.Note that you'll need to make sure it loads after the google maps API:I have design google map infowindow with image & some content as per below.You could use a css class too.Good day!

you can use the ::-webkit-scrollbar pseudo-element on the iframe's parent to get rid of those famous 90's scroll bars. Edit: though it's relatively supported, ::-webkit-scrollbar may not suit all browsers. use with caution :)Like this you make the width of the Iframe larger than it should be.

Font size in CSS - % or em?

[Font size in CSS - % or em?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/132685/font-size-in-css-or-em)

When setting the size of fonts in CSS, should I be using a percent value (%) or em? Can you explain the advantage?

2008-09-25 11:18:07Z

When setting the size of fonts in CSS, should I be using a percent value (%) or em? Can you explain the advantage?There's a really good article on web typography on A List Apart.Their conclusion:From http://archivist.incutio.com/viewlist/css-discuss/1408Both adjust the font-size relative to what it was. 1.5em is the same as 150%. The only advantage seems to be readability, choose whichever you are most comfortable with.Given that (nearly?) all browsers now resize the page as a whole, rather than just the text, previous issues with px vs. % vs. ems in terms of accessible font resizing are rather moot. So, the answer is that it probably doesn't matter. Use whatever works for you.The real difference comes apparent when you use it not for font-sizes. Setting a padding of 1em is not the same as 100%. em is always relative to the font-size. But % might be relative to font-size, width, height and probably some other things I don't know about.Regarding the difference between the css units % and em.As far as I understand (at least theoretically/conceptually, but possibly not how these two units might be implemented in browsers) these two units are equivalent, i.e. if you multiply your em value with 100 and then replace em with % it should be the same thing ?If there actually is some real difference between em and % then can someone explain it (or provide a link to an explanation) ?(I wanted to add this comment of mine where it would belong, i.e. indented just below the answer by "Liam, answered Sep 25 '08 at 11:21" since I also want to know why his answer was downvoted, but I could not figure out how to put my comment there and therefore had to write this "thread global" reply)As Galwegian mentions, px is the most reliable for web typography, as everything else you do on the page is mostly laid out in reference to a computer monitor. The problem with absolute sizes is that some browsers (IE) won't scale pixel-value elements on a web-page, so when you try to zoom in/out, everything adjusts except for those elements.I do not know whether IE8 handles this properly, but all other browser vendors handle pixels just fine and it is still a minority case where a user needs to enlarge/diminish text (this text box on SO perhaps being the exception). If you want to get really dirty, you could always add a javascript function for making your text size larger and offer a "small"/"larger" button to the user.Yahoo User Interface library (http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/) has a nice set of base css classes used to "reset" the browser specific settings so that the basis for displaying the site is same for all (supported) browsers.With YUI one is supposed to use percentages.

You can fix it with gimp eg.to simulate RGBA and HSLA background in IE, you can use a gradient filter, with the same start and end color ( alpha channel is the first pair in the value of HEX ) I believe this is the best because on this page has a tool to help you generate alpha-transparent background:"Cross browser alpha transparent background CSS (rgba)" (*now linked to archive.org)the transparent png image will not work in IE 6-, alternatives are:with CSS:or just do it with jQuery:Though late, I had to use that today and found a very useful php script here that will allow you to dynamically create a png file, much like the way rgba works.The script can be downloaded here: http://lea.verou.me/wp-content/uploads/2009/02/rgba.zipI know it may not be the perfect solution for everybody, but it's worth considering in some cases, since it saves a lot of time and works flawlessly.

This code is used by me and it’s mostly perfect. make comment if it’s perfect.You use css to change the opacity. To cope with IE you'd need something like:But the only problem with this is that it means anything inside the container will also be 0.3 opacity. Thus you'll have to change your HTML to have another container, not inside the transparent one, that holds your content.Otherwise the png technique, would work.

I have a header element and a content element:I want the header to be of fixed height and the content to fill up all the remaining height available on the screen, with overflow-y: scroll;. It this possible without Javascript? The trick to this is specifying 100% height on the html and body elements.

Some browsers look to the parent elements (html, body) to calculate the height. forget all the answers, this line of CSS worked for me in 2 seconds :1vh = 1% of browser screen heightsourceFor responsive layout scaling, you might want to use :[update november 2018]

As mentionned in the comments, using the min-height might avoid having issues on reponsive designs[update april 2018] As mentioned in the comments, back in 2011 when the question was asked, not all browsers supported the viewport units.

The other answers were the solutions back then -- vmax is still not supported in IE, so this might not be the best solution for all yet. Actually the best approach is this:This solves everything for me and it helps me to control my footer and it can have the fixed footer no matter if page is being scrolled down.Technical Solution - EDITEDHistorically, 'height' is tricky thing to mold with, compared to 'width', the easiest. Since css focus on <body> for styling to work. The code above - we gave <html> and <body> a height. This is where magic comes into picture - since we have 'min-height' on playing table, we are telling browser that <body> is superior over <html> because <body> holds the min-height. This in turn, allows <body> to override <html> because <html> had height already earlier. In other words, we are tricking browser to "bump" <html> off the table, so we could style independently.The accepted solution will not actually work. 

You will notice that the content div will be equal to the height of its parent, body. 

So setting the body height to 100% will set it equal to the height of the browser window. Let's say the browser window was 768px in height, by setting the content div height to 100%, the div's height will in turn be 768px. Thus, you will end up with the header div being 150px and the content div being 768px. In the end you will have content 150px below the bottom of the page. For another solution, check out this link.You can use vh on the min-height property.You can do as follows, depending on how you are using the margins...With HTML5 you can do this:CSS:HTML:For me, the next worked well:I wrapped the header and the content on a divI used this reference to fill the height with flexbox. The CSS goes like this:For more info about the flexbox technique, visit the referenceYou can also set the parent to display: inline. See http://codepen.io/tommymarshall/pen/cECyHBe sure to also have the height of html and body set to 100%, too.The accepted answer does not work. And the highest voted answer does not answer the actual question. With a fixed pixel height header, and a filler in the remaining display of the browser, and scroll for owerflow. Here is a solution that actually works, using absolute positioning. I also assume that the height of the header is known, by the sound of "fixed header" in the question. I use 150px as an example here:HTML:CSS:(adding background-color for visual effect only)For a more detailed look how this works, with actual content inside the #Content, have a look at this jsfiddle, using bootstrap rows and columns. In this instance I want my main content div to be liquid height so that the whole page takes up 100% of the browser height.height: 100vh;Please let me add my 5 cents here and offer a classical solution:This will work in all browsers, no script, no flex. Open snippet in full page mode and resize browser: desired proportions are preserved even in fullscreen mode.To complete my answer, here is the footer layout:And here is the layout with both header and footer:Unless you need to support IE 9 and below, I would use flexboxYou also need to get body to fill the whole pageCSS PLaY | cross browser fixed header/footer/centered single column layoutCSS Frames, version 2: Example 2, specified width | 456 Berea StreetOne important thing is that although this sounds easy, there's going to be quite a bit of ugly code going into your CSS file to get an effect like this. Unfortunately, it really is the only option.The best solution I found so far is setting a footer element at the bottom of the page and then evaluate the difference of the offset of the footer and the element we need to expand.

If you were setting, border or something single-worded like that instead, your code would work just fine.However, the thing you need to remember for padding-top, and for any hyphenated attribute name, is that in javascript, you remove the hyphen, and make the next letter uppercase, so in your case that'd be paddingTop.There are some other exceptions. JavaScript has some reserved words, so you can't set float like that, for instance. Instead, in some browsers you need to use cssFloat and in others styleFloat. It is for discrepancies like this that it is recommended that you use a framework such as jQuery, that handles browser incompatibilities for you...In addition to other answers, if you want to use the dash notition for style properties, you can also use:I resolve similar problem with:Hope that helps.Assuming you have HTML like this:If you want to modify the style attribute of this div, you'd use Replace [ATTRIBUTE] with the style attribute you want. Remember to remove '-' and make the following letter uppercase. ExamplesThere is also style.setProperty function:

https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CSSStyleDeclaration/setPropertywill beI would recommend using a function, which accepts the element id and an object containing the CSS properties, to handle this. This way you write multiple styles at once and use standard CSS property syntax. Better still you could store the styles in a variable, which will make for much easier property management e.g. Hope that helpsSurprised that I did not see the below query selector way solution,CSSStyleDeclaration solutions, an example of the accepted answerwould also do the job.works for me

How to make a <svg> element expand or contract to its parent container?

[How to make a <svg> element expand or contract to its parent container?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8919076/how-to-make-a-svg-element-expand-or-contract-to-its-parent-container)

The goal is to have the <svg> element expand to the size of its parent container, in this case a <div>, no matter how big or small that container may be.The code:The most common solution to this problem seems to be setting the viewBox attribute on the <svg> element. However, this does not seem to work in cases where elements within the <svg> element have predefined widths and/or heights. For example, the <rect> element, in the above code, has its width and height explicitly set.So the obvious solution is to use % widths and % heights on those elements as well.  But does this even have to be done?  Especially, since <img src=test.svg > works fine and expands/contracts without any problems with explicitly set <rect> heights and widths.If elements like <rect>, and other elements like it, have to have their widths and heights defined in percentages, is there a way in Inkscape to set it so that all elements with the <svg> document use percentage widths, heights, etc.. instead of fixed dimensions?

Define your viewBox to be 100 units in width, then define your rect to be 10 units.  After that, however large you scale the SVG, the rect will be 10% the width of the image.Suppose I have an SVG which looks like this:

 And I want to put it in a div and make it fill the div responsively. My way of doing it is as follows:First I open the SVG file in an application like inkscape. In File->Document Properties I set the width of the document to 800px and and the height to 600px (you can choose other sizes). Then I fit the SVG into this document.Then I save this file as a new SVG file and get the path data from this file.

Now in HTML the code that does the magic is as follows:Note that width and height of SVG are both set to 100%, since we want it to fill the container vertically and horizontally ,but width and height of the viewBox are the same as the width and height of the document in inkscape which is 800px X 600px. The next thing you need to do is set the preserveAspectRatio to "none". If you need to have more information on this attribute here's a good link. And that's all there is to it.One more thing is that this code works on almost all the major browsers even the old ones but on some versions of android and ios you need to use some javascrip/jQuery code to keep it consistent. I use the following in document ready and resize functions:Hope it helps!What's worked for me recently is to remove all height="" and width="" attributes from the <svg> tag and all child tags. Then you can use scaling using a percentage of the parent container's height or width.@robertc has it right, but you also need to notice that svg, #container causes the svg to be scaled exponentially for anything but 100% (once for #container and once for svg).In other words, if I applied 50% h/w to both elements, it's actually 50% of 50%, or .5 * .5, which equals .25, or 25% scale.One selector works fine when used as @robertc suggests.For your iphone You could use in your head balise :

I have used LESS.js before. It's easy to use, something likeI saw SASS.js. How can I use it in a similar way? Parsing a SASS file for use immediately in HTML. It seems like SASS.js is more for use with Node.js?There is no officially sanctioned JavaScript implementation of sass or scss. There are a couple of implementations in progress that I've seen, but none that I can recommend using at this time.However, please a few points:So while it's a little more setup to get started, we (the sass core team) think that server side compilation is the best long term approach. Similarly, the less developers prefer server side compilation for production stylesheets.Since visionmeda/sass.js isn't available anymore and scss-js hasn't been updated in 2 years, I might interest you in sass.js. It's the C++ library libsass (also used by node-sass) compiled to JavaScript using Emscripten. An implementation to compile scss stylesheets linked or inlined in html can be found at sass.link.js.Try out sass.js using the interactive playgroundYESAs we were expecting, after rewriting it on C++, it is possible to compile it in Javascript via Emscripten.This is browser version: https://github.com/medialize/sass.js/As they recommend, for node you can use this one: https://github.com/sass/node-sassI just discovered an interesting Sass.js Playground. A few things may have changed over the years. Check this out:http://medialize.github.io/playground.sass.js/You definitely shouldn't make all of your users compile stylesheets, however a javascript implementation can run on the server as well. I'm also looking for a javascript sass implementation - to use in a node.js app. Is this something the sass team is considering?There is an attempt on GitHub, scss-js. However, it is incomplete and hasn't had any commits in five months.While there is no officially sanctioned JavaScript implementation of sass, there is an official C/C++ port of the Sass engine, known as LibSass. Because LibSass is an official implementation, it's best to opt for a JavaScript library that uses LibSass under the hood.For JavaScript running in a Node.js environment, there's Node-sass.Under the hood, Node-sass uses LibSass itself.For JavaScript running in the browser, there's Sass.js.Under the hood, Sass.js uses a version of LibSass (v3.3.6 at the point of my writing this) that's been converted to JavaScript with Emscripten.

I am creating my application using Django, and am wondering how I can make Django use my CSS file? What settings do I need to do to make Django see the css file?NB: On a local machineIf you're using the development server follow the django project's how-to guide for managing static files to setup your URL's, then reference you media files in the template -- say, an image inside an image folder from /site_media/images/foo.gif.More generally stated, you're asking how to serve a static file from Django. If you are running under Apache, you should read http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/howto/deployment/modpython/If you are running the development server (say, on your laptop), read http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/howto/static-files/Do note the big, fat disclaimer regarding the Django development server:This caused me problems too for a while (404 not found errors). The missing bit for me was to edit the STATICFILES_DIRS tuple in settings.py to give me this:This then picked up my CSS files in a folder called 'media' that was at the top level of my django project.I also had:(make sure you have the leading / above in STATIC_URL)Of course, as said above, you need to have the CSS file properly included from your html files. I had:None.Make sure your template includes the CSS file (as standard HTML does) and put the CSS file on the media server.To clarify: With Django it is highly recommended that you serve all your media (everything that isn't dynamic html) from a different server instance. How you implement that is completely up to you but most people create a subdomain.The official django docs didn't help me. Hope the blog post "Django: How to serve static files" helps some of you.Well the easiest way to use css with django, is to add it to your templates as static-files.But it's a bit like ajax, I didn't find anything that tells how to include it in a standard way.There is a css-compressor module for django if you want to optimise its size.

[What does「i」mean in a CSS attribute selector?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/27506735/what-does-i-mean-in-a-css-attribute-selector)

I have found the following CSS selector in the Google Chrome user agent stylesheet:What does the i mean?

2014-12-16 14:19:04Z

I have found the following CSS selector in the Google Chrome user agent stylesheet:What does the i mean?As mentioned in the comments, it is for case-insensitive attribute matching. This is a new feature in CSS Selectors Level 4.Presently it is available in Chrome 49+, Firefox 47+, Safari 9+, and Opera 37+*. Prior to this it was only available in the Chrome user-agent styles starting around Chrome 39, but could be enabled for web content by setting the experimental features flag.* Earlier versions of Opera may also support it.The above square will be green if the browser supports this feature, red if it does not.That is the case-insensitive flag for attribute selectors, introduced in Selectors 4. Apparently they snuck an implementation of this feature into Chrome as early as August 2014.In a nutshell: this flag tells the browser to match the respective values for the type attribute case-insensitively. The default selector matching behavior for attribute values in HTML is case-sensitive, which is often undesirable because many attributes are defined to have case-insensitive values, and you want to make sure your selector picks up all the right elements regardless of case. type is one example of such an attribute, because it is an enumerated attribute, and enumerated attributes are said to have case-insensitive values.Here are the relevant commits:Note that it's currently hidden within the "Enable experimental Web Platform features" flag, which you can access at chrome://flags/#enable-experimental-web-platform-features. This might explain why the feature went largely unnoticed — features hidden behind that flag can only be used internally and not in public-facing code (such as author stylesheets) unless it is enabled, because they are experimental and therefore not ready for production use.Here's a test case that you can use — compare the results when the flag is enabled and disabled:Note that I use a custom data attribute instead of type to show that it can be used with just about any attribute.I am not aware of any other implementations as of this writing, but hopefully other browsers will catch up soon. This is a relatively simple but extremely useful addition to the standard and I look forward to being able to use it in future.

I would like to have A B and C aligned in the middle.How can I get D to go completely to the right?BEFORE:AFTER:https://jsfiddle.net/z44p7bsx/Below are five options for achieving this layout:Apply position: relative to the flex container.Apply position: absolute to item D.Now this item is absolutely positioned within the flex container.More specifically, item D is removed from the document flow but stays within the bounds of the nearest positioned ancestor.Use the CSS offset properties top and right to move this element into position.One caveat to this method is that some browsers may not completely remove an absolutely-positioned flex item from the normal flow. This changes the alignment in a non-standard, unexpected way. More details: Absolutely positioned flex item is not removed from the normal flow in IE11With a combination of auto margins and a new, invisible flex item the layout can be achieved.The new flex item is identical to item D and is placed at the opposite end (the left edge).More specifically, because flex alignment is based on the distribution of free space, the new item is a necessary counterbalance to keep the three middle boxes horizontally centered. The new item must be the same width as the existing D item, or the middle boxes won't be precisely centered.The new item is removed from view with visibility: hidden.In short:This method is similar to #2, except it's cleaner semantically and the width of D must be known.Starting with Method #2 or #3 above, instead of worrying about equal width for the left and right items to maintain equal balance, just give each one flex: 1. This will force them both to consume available space, thus centering the middle item.You can then add display: flex to individual items in order to align their content.NOTE about using this method with min-height: Currently in Chrome, Firefox, Edge and possibly other browsers, the shorthand rule flex: 1 breaks down to this:That percentage unit (%) on flex-basis causes this method to break when min-height is used on the container. This is because, as a general rule, percentage heights on the children require an explicit height property setting on the parent.This is an old CSS rule dating back to 1998 (CSS Level 2) which is still in effect in many browsers to some degree or another. For complete details see here and here.Here's an illustration of the problem posted in the comments by user2651804:The solution is to not use the percentage unit. Try px or just nothing at all (which is what the spec actually recommends, despite the fact that at least some of the major browsers have appended a percentage unit for whatever reason).This may be the cleanest and most efficient method. There is no need for absolute positioning, fake elements or other hackery.Simply create a grid with multiple columns. Then position your items in the middle and end columns. Basically, just leave the first column empty.If you want to make it aligned, you can simply attach an empty span and split the three child spans into them.Most easy wayVery clear question. I couldn't help but post the answer after a few hours of digging. We Could of solved this with tables, table-cell, absolute positions, transforms but we just had to do it with flexbox :)http://codepen.io/rgfx/pen/BLorgdI expanded on Michael_B's answerHere with the help of SASS as a codepenUsing the display:grid approach, you can simply put all of the ul children into the same cell and then set justify-self:The accepted answer can be changed a bit because you can use grid template areas and do it without fake element

That's fine, but can we also have it stretch or shrink the height to maintain the image proportions?HTMLCSSFor img tags if you define one side then other side is resized to keep aspect ratio and by default images expand to their original size.Using this fact if you wrap each img tag into div tag and set its width to 100% of parent div then height will be according to aspect ratio as you wanted.http://jsfiddle.net/0o5tpbxg/To keep images from stretching in either axis inside a flex parent I have found a couple of solutions. You can try using object-fit on the image which, e.g.http://jsfiddle.net/ykw3sfjd/Or you can add flex-specfic rules which may work better in some cases.No need to add a containing div.The default for the css "align-items" property is "stretch" which is what is causing your images to be stretched to its full original height.  Setting the css "align-items" property to "flex-start" fixes your issue.But that doesn't work as expected if the images that are being set as direct flex items with the current Flexible Box Layout Module Level 1, as far as I know.See these discussions and bug reports might be related:As a workaround, you could wrap each <img> with a <div> or a <span>, or so.jsFiddleAlternatively, you can use CSS table layout instead, which you'll get similar results as flexbox, it will work on more browsers, even for IE8.jsFiddleI have been playing around flexbox lately and i came to solution for this through experimentation and the following reasoning. However, in reality I'm not sure if this is exactly what happens.If real width is affected by flex system. So after width of elements hit max width of parent they extra width set in css is ignored. Then it's safe to set width to 100%.Since height of img tag is derived from image itself then setting height to 0% could do something. (this is where i am unclear as to what...but it made sense to me that it should fix it)(remember saw it here first!)Works only in chrome yetThis behavior is expected. flex container will stretch all its children by default. Image have no exception. (ie, parent will have align-items: stretch property )To keep the aspect ratio we've two solutions:orActually I found out that the container of the image tag need to have a height in order to keep the ratio of the image.

 for example>then in your html your container will wrap the tag imagethis work for IE and other browsersI just had the same issue. Use the flex align to center your elements. You need to use align-items: center instead of align-content: center. This will maintain the aspect ratio, while align-content will not keep the aspect ratio.

If I use a pixel or em value for border-radius, the edge radius is always a circular arc or a pill shape even if the value is greater than the largest side of the element.  When I use percentages, the edge radius is elliptic and starts at the middle of each side of the element resulting in an oval or ellipse shape :Pixel value for border-radius :

Percent value for border-radius :Why doesn't border radius in percentages act the same way as border-radius set with pixel or em values?

When I use percentages, the edge radius is elliptic and starts at the middle of each side of the element resulting in an oval or ellipse shape :Pixel value for border-radius :

Percent value for border-radius :Why doesn't border radius in percentages act the same way as border-radius set with pixel or em values?First, you need to understand that the border-radius property takes 2 values. These values are the radii on the X/Y axis of a quarter ellipse defining the shape of the corner.

If only one of the values is set then the second value is equal to the first one. So border-radius: x is equivalent to border-radius:x/x;.  Refering to the W3C specs : CSS Backgrounds and Borders Module Level 3 border-radius property this is what we can read concerning percentage values:So border-radius:50%; defines the raddi of the ellipse this way :Using one value other than a percentage for border radius (em, in, viewport related units, cm...) will always result in an ellipse with the same X/Y radii. In other words, a circle.When you set border-radius:999px; the radii of the circle should be 999px. But another rule is applied when the curves overlap reducing the radii of the circle to half the size of the smallest side. So in your example it is equal to half the height of the element : 50px. For this example (with a fixed size element) you can obtain the same result with both px and percentages. As the element is 230px x 100px, border-radius: 50%; is equivalent to border-radius:115px/50px; (50% of both sides) :Just divide the first value by the % you want.. so if you want a border-radius of 50%, write:or another example:You can easily do the math in js or SASS.Not an actual answer to the question but a usability advice for anyone that might stumble upon it:  If you want to use a relative unit but don't want the elliptical behaviour of % you can always use em or rem. E.g. border-radius: 1em;

Let's face it, it's the hand we've been dealt. BUT, this does not mean you have an excuse to be lazy in your development, by ignoring current standards in favor of deprecated ones.Out goal should be to maintain compliance with current standards, while supporting as much of the legacy standard as possible.If pseudo-elements use : in CSS2 and :: in CSS3, we should not be using one or the other; we should be using both.To fully answer the original question asked, the following is the most appropriate method of supporting the most current implementation of CSS (version 3), while retaining legacy support for version 2.However, it's become increasingly popular to use polyfills for both new javascript and CSS, so you might just want to stick with using the newer double-colon (::) syntax, and maintain a polyfill for older browsers, so long as that is necessary.For what it's worth according to Browser Stats IE 8.0 has dropped to less than 1% in the USA over the past year.http://gs.statcounter.com/browser-version-partially-combined-market-share/desktop/united-states-of-america/#monthly-201512-201612In December 2015 IE 8.0 had 2.92% of the market.

In December 2016 IE 8.0 had .77% of the market.At that rate of decline it wouldn't be the worst idea to stop supporting old versions of IE and start using :: for Pseudo Elements.Including both notations is certainly safer, but I can't see any browser dropping the single notation for a long time, so only a single one'll be fine (it's valid CSS2.)Personnaly I only use the single colon notation, mostly by habit.

I would like to avoid a manual modification of the Bootstrap files.Go to http://getbootstrap.com/customize/ and toggle just what you want from the BS3 framework and then click "Compile and Download" and you'll get the CSS and JS that you chose.Open up the CSS and remove all but the grid. They include some normalize stuff too. And you'll need to adjust all the styles on your site to box-sizing: border-box - http://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css3_pr_box-sizing.aspCheckout zirafa/bootstrap-grid-only. It contains only the bootstrap grid and responsive utilities that you need (no reset or anything), and simplifies the complexity of working directly with the LESS files.Just choose Grid system and "responsive utilities"

it gives you this: http://jsfiddle.net/7LVzs/Made a Grunt build with the Bootstrap 3.3.5 grid only:https://github.com/horgen/grunt-builds/tree/master/bootstrap-grid~10KB minimized.If you need some other parts from Bootstrap just include them in /src/less/bootstrap.less.I would suggest using MDO's http://getpreboot.com/ instead. As of v2, preboot back ports the LESS mixins/variables used to create the Bootstrap 3.0 Grid System and is much more light weight than using the CSS generator. In fact, if you only include preboot.less there is NO overhead because the entire file is made up of mixins/variables and therefore are only used in pre-compilation and not the final output.It looks like you can download just the grid now on Bootstrap 4s new download features.It's been a while since this question was asked, but maybe now you can forego Bootstrap altogether and use CSS Grid! (it's simpler, neater, more flexible and faster). See this cool article: Stop using Bootstrap — create a practical CSS Grid template for your component based UI

This is matched by :first-child:The difference between :first-child and :first-of-type is that :first-of-type will match the first element of its element type, which in HTML is represented by its tag name, even if that element is not the first child of the parent. So far the child elements we're looking at have all been divs, but bear with me, I'll get to that in a bit.For now, the converse also holds true: any :first-child is also :first-of-type by necessity. Since the first child here is also the first div, it will match both pseudo-classes, as well as the type selector div:Now, if you change the type of the first child from div to something else, like h1, it will still be the first child, but it will no longer be the first div obviously; instead, it becomes the first (and only) h1. If there are any other div elements following this first child within the same parent, the first of those div elements will then match div:first-of-type. In the given example, the second child becomes the first div after the first child is changed to an h1:Note that :first-child is equivalent to :nth-child(1).This also implies that while any element may only have a single child element matching :first-child at a time, it can and will have as many children matching the :first-of-type pseudo-class as the number of types of children it has. In our example, the selector .parent > :first-of-type (with an implicit * qualifying the :first-of-type pseudo) will match two elements, not just one:The same holds true for :last-child and :last-of-type: any :last-child is by necessity also :last-of-type, since absolutely no other element follows it within its parent. Yet, because the last div is also the last child, the h1 cannot be the last child, despite being the last of its type.:nth-child() and :nth-of-type() function very similarly in principle when used with an arbitrary integer argument (as in the :nth-child(1) example mentioned above), but where they differ is in the potential number of elements matched by :nth-of-type(). This is covered in detail in What is the difference between p:nth-child(2) and p:nth-of-type(2)?I have created an example to demonstrate the difference between first-child and first-of-type here.HTMLCSSTo see the complete example, please visit https://jsfiddle.net/bwLvyf3k/1/

I would like to use conditions in my CSS.The idea is that I have a variable that I replace when the site is run to generate the right style-sheet.I want it so that according to this variable the style-sheet changes!It looks like:Can this be done? How do you do this?Not in the traditional sense, but you can use classes for this, if you have access to the HTML. Consider this:and in your CSS file:That's the CSS way to do it.Then there are CSS preprocessors like Sass. You can use conditionals there, which'd look like this:Disadvantages are, that you're bound to pre-process your stylesheets, and that the condition is evaluated at compile time, not run time.A newer feature of CSS proper are custom properties (a.k.a. CSS variables). They are evaluated at run time (in browsers supporting them).With them you could do something along the line:Finally, you can preprocess your stylesheet with your favourite server-side language. If you're using PHP, serve a style.css.php file, that looks something like this:In this case, you will however have a performance impact, since caching such a stylesheet will be difficult.Below is my old answer which is still valid but I have a more opinionated approach today:One of the reasons why CSS sucks so much is exactly that it doesn't have conditional syntax. CSS is per se completely unusable in the modern web stack. Use SASS for just a little while and you'll know why I say that. SASS has conditional syntax... and a LOT of other advantages over primitive CSS too.Old answer (still valid):It cannot be done in CSS in general!You have the browser conditionals like:But nobody keeps you from using Javascript to alter the DOM or assigning classes dynamically or even concatenating styles in your respective programming language.I sometimes send css classes as strings to the view and echo them into the code like that (php):You could create two separate stylesheets and include one of them based on the comparison resultIn one of the you can putIn the other oneI think that the only check you can perform in CSS is browser recognition:Conditional-CSSYou can use calc() in combination with var() to sort of mimic conditionals:conceptSet the server up to parse css files as PHP and  then define the variable variable with a simple PHP statement.Of course this assumes you are using PHP...You can use not instead of if like As far as i know, there is no if/then/else in css. Alternatively, you can use javascript function to alter the background-position property of an element.Yet another option (based on whether you want that if statement to be dynamically evaluated or not) is to use the C preprocessor, as described here.(Yes, old thread. But it turned up on top of a Google-search so others might be interested as well)I guess the if/else-logic could be done with javascript, which in turn can dynamically load/unload stylesheets. I haven't tested this across browsers etc. but it should work. This will get you started:http://www.javascriptkit.com/javatutors/loadjavascriptcss.shtmlThis is a little extra info to the Boldewyn answer above.Add some php code to do the if/elseYou can add container div for all your condition scope.Add the condition value as a class to the container div. (you can set it by server side programming - php/asp...)Now you can use the container class as global variable for all elements in the div using nested selector, without adding the class to each element.CSS is a nicely designed paradigm, and many of it's features are not much used.If by a condition and variable you mean a mechanism to distribute a change of some value to the whole document, or under a scope of some element, then this is how to do it:This way, you distribute the impact of the variable throughout the CSS styles.

This is similar to what @amichai and @SeReGa propose, but more versatile.Another such trick is to distribute the ID of some active item throughout the document, e.g. again when highlighting a menu:  (Freemarker syntax used)Sure,this is only practical with a limited set of items, like categories or states, and not unlimited sets like e-shop goods, otherwise the generated CSS would be too big. But it is especially convenient when generating static offline documents.One more trick to do "conditions" with CSS in combination with the generating platform is this:I am surprised that nobody has mentioned CSS pseudo-classes, which are also a sort-of conditionals in CSS. You can do some pretty advanced things with this, without a single line of JavaScript.Some pseudo-classes:Example:If you're open to using jquery, you can set conditional statements using javascript within the html:This will change the text color of .class to green if the value of Variable is greater than 0.You can use javascript for this purpose, this way:You can use php if you write css in the  Tag

How to change the style of alert box?

[How to change the style of alert box?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7853130/how-to-change-the-style-of-alert-box)

I need to change the style of the "OK" Button in an alert box.

2011-10-21 17:38:18Z

I need to change the style of the "OK" Button in an alert box.The alert box is a system object, and not subject to CSS. To do this style of thing you would need to create an HTML element and mimic the alert() functionality. The jQuery UI Dialogue does a lot of the work for you, working basically as I have described: Link.I tried to use script for   alert() boxes styles using java-script.Here i used those JS and CSS.Refer this coding JS functionality.And CSS for alert() BoxAnd HTML file: And also View this DEMO: JSFIDDLE and DEMO RESULT IMAGEI use SweetAlert, It's Awesome, You will get lots of customization option as well as all callbacksNot possible. If you want to customize the dialog's visual appearance, you need to use a JS-based solution like jQuery.UI dialog.Option1. you can use AlertifyJS , this is good for alertOption2. you start up or just join a project based on webapplications, the design of interface is maybe good. Otherwise this should be changed. In order to Web 2.0 applications you will work with dynamic contents, many effects and other stuff. All these things are fine, but no one thought about to style up the JavaScript alert and confirm boxes.

Here is the they way    create simple js file name jsConfirmStyle.js. Here is simple js codeCreate simple html file

    One option is to use altertify, this gives a nice looking alert box.Simply include the required libraries from here, and use the following piece of code to display the alert box.The output will look like this. To see it in action here is the demoYou need to create your own alert box like this:The js portion gets the element in the HTML to create the alert box, then deletes it after the user clicks ok.You can call the alert using jAlert("Custom Text", "Ok!");I know this is an older post but I was looking for something similar this morning.

I feel that my solution was much simpler after looking over some of the other solutions. 

One thing is that I use font awesome in the anchor tag.I wanted to display an event on my calendar when the user clicked the event. So I coded a separate <div> tag like so:I find it easier to use class names in my jquery since I am using asp.net.Below is the jquery for my fullcalendar app.You must have your own google calendar id and api keys.I hope this helps when you need a simple popup display.Styling alert()-boxes ist not possible. You could use a javascript modal overlay instead.I don't think you could change the style of browsers' default alert boxes. You need to create your own or use a simple and customizable library like xdialog. Following is a example to customize the alert box. More demos can be found here.I use sweetalert2 library. It's really simple, a lot of customization, modern, animated windows, eye-catching, and also nice design. Check this linkI use AlertifyJS to style my dialogues.

My immediate thought was to invert the color of the background as the text. This involves simply parsing the background and inverting its RGB value.Something like this: http://jsfiddle.net/2VTnZ/2/mix-blend-mode does the trick:Addition (March 2018):

Following, a nice tutorial explaining all different types of modes/implementations: https://css-tricks.com/css-techniques-and-effects-for-knockout-text/I've found the BackgroundCheck script to be very useful.It detects the overal brightness of the background (be it a background image or a color), and applies a class to the assigned text-element (background--light or background--dark), dependent on the brightness of the background.It can be applied to still and moving elements.(Source)If you are using ES6, convert hex to RGB then can use this:Here's my attempt:Then to use it:This will straight away, make the text either black or white as appropriate. To do the icons:Then each icon could look like 'save' + iconSuffix + '.jpg'.Note that this won't work where any container overflows its parent (for example, if the CSS height is 0, and overflow isn't hidden).

Difference between CSS3 transitions' ease-in and ease-out

What’s the difference between CSS3 transitions’ ease-in, ease-out, etc.?

2012-03-09 05:25:18Z

What’s the difference between CSS3 transitions’ ease-in, ease-out, etc.?CSS3's transitions and animations support easing, formally called a "timing function". The common ones are ease-in, ease-out, ease-in-out, ease, and linear, or you can specify your own using cubic-bezier().Basically, easing out is to slow to a halt, easing in is to slowly accelerate, and linear is to do neither. You can find more detailed resources at the documentation for timing-function on MDN.And if you do want the aforementioned precise effects, the amazing Lea Verou’s cubic-bezier.com is there for you! It’s also useful for comparing the different timing functions graphically.Another, the steps() timing function, acts like linear, but only performs a finite number of steps between the transition’s beginning and its end. steps() has been most useful to me in CSS3 animations, rather than in transitions; a good example is in loading indicators with dots. Traditionally, one uses a series of static images (say eight dots, two changing colour each frame) to produce the illusion of motion. With a steps(8) animation and a rotate transform, you’re using motion to produce the illusion of separate frames! How fun.

Here's an example:I would expect, the third example with class="basic extra" should have a blue border, since the in extra specified border would overwrite the border from basic. I'm using FF 3 on ubuntu 9.04The order in which the attributes are overwritten is not determined by the order the classes are defined in the class attribute, but instead where they appear in the CSS.The text in the div will appear green, and not red; because .myClass2 is further down in the CSS definition than .myClass1. If I were to swap the ordering of the class names in the class attribute, nothing would change.The order of classes in the attribute is irrelevant.  All the classes in the class attribute are applied equally to the element.The question is: in what order do the style rules appear in your .css file.  In your example, .basic comes after .extra so the .basic rules will take precedence wherever possible.If you want to provide a third possibility (e.g., that it's .basic but that the .extra rules should still apply), you'll need to invent another class, .basic-extra perhaps, which explicitly provides for that.This can be done, but you have to get a little creative with your selectors. Using attribute selectors, you can specify things like "begins with", "ends with", "contains", etc. See example below using your same markup, but with attribute selectors.

If you're using Google Maps v2, call checkResize() on your map after resizing the container.  linkUPDATEGoogle Maps JavaScript API v2 was deprecated in 2011. It is not available anymore.for Google Maps v3, you need to trigger the resize event differently:See the documentation for the resize event (you'll need to search for the word 'resize'): http://code.google.com/apis/maps/documentation/v3/reference.html#eventUpdate This answer has been here a long time, so a little demo might be worthwhile & although it uses jQuery, there's no real need to do so.UPDATE 2018-05-22With a new renderer release in version 3.32 of Maps JavaScript API the resize event is no longer a part of Map class.The documentation states source: https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/new-renderergoogle.maps.event.trigger(map, "resize"); doesn't have any effect starting from version 3.32The popular answer google.maps.event.trigger(map, "resize"); didn't work for me alone.

I have implemented fancybox2 on a dev site.When I engage the fancybox  (click the link etc) the whole html shifts behind it - and goes to the top. I have it working fine in another demo, but when I drag the same code to this project it jumps to the top. Not only with the links to inline divs, but also for simple image gallery.Has anyone experienced this?This can actually be done with a helper in Fancybox 2.http://davekiss.com/prevent-fancybox-from-jumping-to-the-top-of-the-page/Jordanj77 is correct but easiest solution is to just go to stylesheet jquery.fancybox.css and comment out the row saying overflow: hidden !important; in section .fancybox-lockI realize this is an old question, but I think I have found a good solution for it. 

The problem is that fancy box changes the overflow value of the body in order to hide the browser scrollbars. As Dave Kiss points out, we can stop fancy box from doing this by adding the following parameters:But, now we can scroll the main page while looking at our fancy box window. It is better than jumping to the top of the page, but it is probably not what we really want. We can prevent scrolling the right way by adding the next parameters:And add these functions from galambalaz. See: How to disable scrolling temporarily?The problem is that fancyBox changes the overflow value of the body in order to hide the browser scrollbars.  I couldn't find an option to toggle this behavior.You could remove this section of the fancyBox code to prevent it:Despite the fact, that the proper way of solving this problem is via the options, which fancybox provides (refer to this answer), CSS could be used to solve the problem. There is no need to edit the library's css file, just add this to the main stylesheet of the application:The code resets the original overflow of the element. The problem is that overflow: hidden; hides the scrollbar on the <html> element, which causes the page to "jump" to the top. In order to preserve the position of the scrollbar, we overwrite the overflow with overflow: visible;This also helpedThe accepted answer is not complete as it does not actually solve the problem it just avoids it! Here is a more complete answer that actually gives you the desired functionality while fixing the window jump issue:    Maybe this answer is alil late but maybe it could help in the future, if after clicling/closing a image fancybox makes your website scroll to the top, you could just delete the :or better use: In fancyBox version: 2.1.5 (Fri, 14 Jun 2013) that part of the code is at line 897.You can actually code like this if you are using fancybox default function:I fixed it with:in .fancybox-lock body in jquery.fancybox.css. And scrollbar not jumping :)

I'm very new to HTML/CSS and I'm trying to display some text as like 50% transparent.  So far I have the HTML to display the text with full opacityHowever, I'm not sure how to change its opacity. I've tried looking online, but I'm not sure exactly what to do with the code I find.opacity applies to the whole element, so if you have a background, border or other effects on that element, those will also become transparent. If you only want the text to be transparent, use rgba.Also, steer far, far away from <font>. We have CSS for that now.Check Opacity, You can set this css property to the div, the <p> or using <span> you want to make transparentAnd by the way, the font tag is deprecated, use css to style the textEdit: This code will make the whole element transparent, if you want to make ** just the text ** transparent check @Mattias Buelens answerJust use the rgba tag as your text color. You could use opacity, but that would affect the whole element, not just the text. Say you have a border, it would make that transparent as well. Your best solution is to look at the "opacity" tag of an element.For example:So in your case it should look something like :However don't forget the  tag isn't supported in HTML5.You should use a CSS too :)What about the css opacity attribute? 0 to 1 values.But then you probably need to use a more explicit dom element than "font". For instance:As an additional information I would of course suggest you use CSS declarations outside of your html elements, but as well try to use the font css style instead of the font html tag.For cross browser css3 styles generator, have a look at http://css3please.com/Easy! after your:add this one: you just have to change the ".6" for a decimal number between 1 and 0There is no CSS property like background-opacity that you can use only for changing the opacity or transparency of an element's background without affecting the child elements, on the other hand if you will try to use the CSS opacity property it will not only changes the opacity of background but changes the opacity of all the child elements as well.

In such situation you can use RGBA color introduced in CSS3 that includes alpha transparency as part of the color value. Using RGBA color you can set the color of the background as well as its transparency.try to play around with mix-blend-mode: multiply;MDNtutorial

I want to avoid JQuery. Is it possible?This uses javascript, not jquery directly. It might help get you started.For those who are still searching for a solution without a separate javascript code. There is little easy solution without writing a javascript or jquery function:JsFiddle DemoIf you want to show the value in text box, simply change output to input.Update:Either use element's Id or name, both are supported in morden browsers.version with editable input:http://jsfiddle.net/Xjxe6/an even better way would be to catch the input event on the input itself 

rather than on the whole form (performance wise) :Here's a fiddle (with the id added as per Ryan's comment).If you want your current value to be displayed beneath the slider and moving along with it, try this:Note that this type of HTML input element has one hidden feature, such as you can move the slider with left/right/down/up arrow keys when the element has focus on it. The same with Home/End/PageDown/PageUp keys.If you're using multiple slides, and you can use jQuery, you can do the follow to deal with multiple sliders easily:Also, by using oninput on the <input type='range'> you'll receive events while dragging the range.I have a solution that involves (Vanilla) JavaScript, but only as a library. You habe to include it once and then all you need to do is set the appropriate source attribute of the number inputs. The source attribute should be the querySelectorAll selector of the range input you want to listen to.It even works with selectcs. And it works with multiple listeners. And it works in the other direction: change the number input and the range input will adjust. And it will work on elements added later onto the page (check https://codepen.io/HerrSerker/pen/JzaVQg for that)Tested in Chrome, Firefox, Edge and IE11For people don't care about jquery use, here is a short way without using any idTry This :and in jQuery section :if you still looking for the answer you can use input type="number" in place of type="range" min max work if it set in that order:

1-name

2-maxlength

3-size

How can I create the opposite effect when the mouse leaves the item area, with an animation from black to #999?jsFiddle(Have in mind that I do not wish to answer only this example, but the entire "opposite of :hover" issue.)If I understand correctly you could do the same thing by moving your transitions to the link rather than the hover state:http://jsfiddle.net/spacebeers/sELKu/3/The definition of hover is:By that definition the opposite of hover is any point at which the mouse is not over it. Someone far smarter than me has done this article, setting different transitions on both states - http://css-tricks.com/different-transitions-for-hover-on-hover-off/Just use CSS transitions instead of animations.Live demoNo there is no explicit property for mouse leave in CSS. You could use :hover on all the other elements except the item in question to achieve this effect. But Im not sure how practical that would be. I think you have to look at a JS / jQuery solution. You can use CSS3 transition Some good links:http://css-tricks.com/different-transitions-for-hover-on-hover-off/http://www.alistapart.com/articles/understanding-css3-transitions/Just add a transition to the element you are messing with. Be aware that there could be some effects when the page loads. Like if you made a border radius change, you will see it when the dom loads.You have misunderstood :hover; it says the mouse is over an item, rather than the mouse has just entered the item.You could add animation to the selector without :hover to achieve the effect you want.Transitions is a better option: http://jsfiddle.net/Cvx96/The opposite of :hover appears to be :link. (edit: not technically an opposite because there are 4 selectors :link, :visited, :hover and :active. Five if you include :focus.)For example when defining a rule .button:hover{ text-decoration:none } to remove the underline on a button, the underline shows up when you roll off the button in some browsers. I've fixed this with .button:hover, .button:link{ text-decoration:none }This of course only works for elements that are actually links (have href attribute)Although answers here are sufficient, I really think W3Schools example on this issue is very straightforward (it cleared up the confusion (for me) right away).In summary, for transitions where you want the "enter" and "exit" animations to be the same, you need to employ transitions on the main selector .button rather than the hover selector .button:hover. For transitions where you want the "enter" and "exit" animations to be different, you will need specify  different main selector and hover selector transitions. Put your duration time in the non-hover selection:Just add a transition and the name of the animation on the class inicial, in your case, ul li a, just add a "transition" property and that is all you need

IE7+ supports attribute selectors:Element input with attribute type which contains a value that is equal to, begins with, contains or ends with a certain value.Other safe (IE7+) selectors are:Which for <p><span/><span/></p> would effectively give you:Further reading:

Browser CSS compatibility on quirksmode.comI'm surprised that everyone else thinks it can't be done. CSS attribute selectors have been here for some time already. I guess it's time we clean up our .css files.Sadly the other posters are correct that you're 

...actually as corrected by kRON, you are ok with your IE7 and a strict doc, but most of us with IE6 requirements are reduced to JS or class references for this, but it is a CSS2 property, just one without sufficient support from IE^h^h browsers.Out of completeness, the type selector is - similar to xpath - of the form [attribute=value] but many interesting variants exist. It will be quite powerful when it's available, good thing to keep in your head for IE8.You can do this with jQuery. Using their selectors, you can select by attributes, such as type. This does, however, require that your users have Javascript turned on, and an additional file to download, but if it works...Sorry, the short answer is no.  CSS (2.1) will only mark up the elements of a DOM, not their attributes.  You'd have to apply a specific class to each input.Bummer I know, because that would be incredibly useful.I know you've said you'd prefer CSS over JavaScript, but you should still consider using jQuery.  It provides a very clean and elegant way of adding styles to DOM elements based on attributes.

Apply display: flex; to the parent container and adjust the placement of its children by justify-content: space-between; like this:Can be seen online here - http://jsfiddle.net/skip405/NfeVh/1073/Note however that flexbox support is IE10 and newer. If you need to support IE 9 or older, use the following solution:2.You can use the text-align: justify technique here.The working example can be seen here: http://jsfiddle.net/skip405/NfeVh/4/. This code works from IE7 and aboveIf inline-block elements in HTML are not separated with space, this solution won't work - see example http://jsfiddle.net/NfeVh/1408/ . This might be a case when you insert content with Javascript.If we don't care about IE7 simply omit the star-hack properties. The working example using your markup is here - http://jsfiddle.net/skip405/NfeVh/5/. I just added the header:after part and justified the content.In order to solve the issue of the extra space that is inserted with the after pseudo-element one can do a trick of setting the font-size to 0 for the parent element and resetting it back to say 14px for the child elements. The working example of this trick can be seen here: http://jsfiddle.net/skip405/NfeVh/326/Taking advantage of @skip405's answer, I've made a Sass mixin for it:It accepts 3 parameters. The container, the left and the right element. 

For example, to fit the question, you could use it like this:If you don't want to use floats, you're going to have to wrap your nav:...and add some more specific css:You may need to do a little more, but that's a start.If you're already using JavaScript to center stuff when the screen is too small (as per your comment for your header), why not just undo floats/margins with JavaScript while you're at it and use floats and margins normally.You could even use CSS media queries to reduce the amount JavaScript you're using.I think one possible solution to this is to use display: table:JSFiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/yxxrnn7j/1/New ways to align items right:Grid:DemoBootstrap 4.

Is there a CSS selector to select this element by its inline style attribute value?something like

2011-12-08 06:05:38Z

Is there a CSS selector to select this element by its inline style attribute value?something likeThe inline style attribute is no different to any other HTML attribute and can be matched with a substring attribute selector:It is for this very reason however that it's extremely fragile. As attribute selectors don't support regular expressions, you can only perform exact substring matches of the attribute value. For instance, if you have a space somewhere in the attribute value, like this:It won't match until you change your selector to accommodate the space. And then it will stop matching values that don't contain the space, unless you include all the permutations, ad nauseum. But if you're working with a document in which the inline style declarations themselves are unlikely to change at all, you should be fine.Note also that this is not at all selecting elements by their actual specified, computed or used values as reflected in the DOM. That is not possible with CSS selectors.Including ";" works better for me.

Our webpage background images are having problems in FireFox as well as Safari in iOS on iPads/iPhones with white space showing up on the right side of the page. The background images extend fine on other browsers but we're having difficulty not extending the full length of the browser on those browsers. Take a look at our site on FireFox to see what I mean. I added:into your CSS at the very top above the other classes and it seemed to fix your issue.Your updated .css file is available hereDebug your CSS for Ghost CSS Elements.Use this bookmark to debug your CSS: https://blog.wernull.com/2013/04/debug-ghost-css-elements-causing-unwanted-scrolling/Or add the CSS directly yourself:In my case a Facebook Like Button caused the problem.After exploring some of the helpful strategies provided here, I found that I only needed to add iOS specific CSS (I put it at the bottom of my main css sheet.) Seems like hiding the overflow-x was the answer for me. I assume that stating the width at 100% helps in the event that my content goes wide. It should be noted that I was only having this issue in iOS. If it is also in Firefox, just the html and body block should probably be used as the @media is specifically targeting mobile devices.Please hip me if this seems incorrect to anyone :)This is a pretty old question, but I thought I'd add my 2 cents.  I've tried the above solutions, including the ghost css, which I will definitely be saving for future use.  But none of these worked in my situation.  Here's how I fixed my issue.  Hopefully this will help someone else. Open inspector (or whatever your preference) and starting with the first div in body tag,  add display: none; to just that element.  If the scroll bar disappears, you know that element contains the element that's causing the issue.  Then, remove the first css rule and go down one level into the containing element.  Add the css to that div, and if the scroll bar goes away, you know that element is either causing, or containing the offending element.  If adding the CSS does nothing, you know it was not that div that caused the issue, and either another div in the container  is causing it, or the container itself is causing it.  This may be too time consuming for some.  Lucky for me, my issue was in the header, but I can imagine this taking a bit of time if your issue was say, in the footer or something.  overflow-x: hidden; works perfect for me.The problem is in the file : style.css - line 721remove the lines :This basically gives a shadow gradient only to the footer. In Firefox, it is the first line that is causing the problem.I've also had the same issue ( Website body background rendering a right white margin in iPhone Safari ) and found that adding the background image to the <html> tag fixed the problem.BeforeAfterApparently the (-o-min-device-pixel-ratio: 3/2) is causing problems.  On my test site it was causing the right side to be cut off.  I found a workaround on github that works for now. Using(-o-min-device-pixel-ratio: ~"3/2") seems to work fine. I see the question has been answered to a general standard, but when I looked at your site I noticed there is still a horizontal scroll-bar. I also notice the reason for this:

You have used the code:which is being used alongside code stating that the element has a width of 100%, causing an element with a total width of 112% of screen size. To fix this, either remove the padding, replace the padding with a margin of 12% for the same effect, or change the width (or max-width) of the element to 88%. This occurs in main.css at line 343. Hope this helps!I had the same issue, so tried a few things. One of which seemed to work for me - removing the width and adding a float to the body tag.May not work for all instances, but in the scenario I recently had, hiding overflow on content elements was a no go...I was experiencing the white line to the right on my iPad as well in horizontal position only. I was using a fixed-position div with a background set to 960px wide and z-index of -999. This particular div only shows up on an iPad due to a media query. Content was then placed into a 960px wide div wrapper.

The answers provided on this page were not helping in my case.

To fix the white stripe issue I changed the width of the content wrapper to 958px. Voilá. No more white right white stripe on the iPad in horizontal position.This question has been hanging around for a while, but none of the fixes I could find worked for me (having the same issue with ipad), but I managed my own solution which should work for most people I imagine.Here's my code:Enjoy!

[text-overflow:ellipsis in Firefox 4? (and FF5)](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4927257/text-overflowellipsis-in-firefox-4-and-ff5)

The text-overflow:ellipsis; CSS property must be one of the few things that Microsoft has done right for the web.All the other browsers now support it... except Firefox.The Firefox developers have been arguing over it since 2005 but despite the obvious demand for it, they can't seem to actually bring themselves to implement it (even an experimental -moz- implementation would be sufficient).A few years ago, someone worked out a way to hack Firefox 3 to make it support an ellipsis. The hack uses the -moz-binding feature to implement it using XUL. Quite a number of sites are now using this hack.The bad news? Firefox 4 is removing the -moz-binding feature, which means this hack won't work any more.So as soon as Firefox 4 is released (later this month, I hear), we're going to be back to the problem of having it not being able to support this feature.So my question is: Is there any other way around this? (I'm trying to avoid falling back to a Javascript solution if at all possible)[EDIT]

Lots of up-votes, so I'm obviously not the only one who wants to know, but I've got one answer so far which basically says 'use javascript'. I'm still hoping for a solution that will either not need JS at all, or at worst only use it as a fall-back where the CSS feature doesn't work. So I'm going to post a bounty on the question, on the off chance that someone, somewhere has found an answer.[EDIT]

An update: Firefox has gone into rapid development mode, but despite FF5 now being released this feature still isn't supported. And now that the majority of users have upgraded from FF3.6, the hack is no longer a solution. The good news I'm told that it might be added to Firefox 6, which with the new release schedule should be out in only a few months. If that's the case, then I guess I can wait it out, but it's a shame they couldn't have sorted it sooner.[FINAL EDIT]

I see that the ellipsis feature has finally been added to Firefox's "Aurora Channel" (ie development version). This means that it should now be released as part of Firefox 7, which is due out toward the end of 2011.

and then do something like the following:EDIT 09/30/2011FF7 is out, this bug is resolved and it works!EDIT 08/29/2011This issue is marked as resolved and will be available in FF 7; currently set to release on 09/27/2011.  Mark your calendars and get ready to remove all those hacks you've put in place.OLDI have another answer:  wait.The FF dev team is in hot pursuit to resolve this issue.They have tentative fix set for Firefox 6.Easy there, imaginary, over-reactive person.  Firefox is on the fast dev track.  FF6 is set for release six weeks after Firefox 5.  Firefox 5 is set for release June 21st, 2011.So that puts the fix sometime in the beginning of August 2011...hopefully.You can sign up for the mailing list following the bug from the link in the original poster's question.Or you can click here; whichever is easiest.I must say I'm a little disappointed that the only browser specific hack in my application is going to be to support FF4. The above javascript solution doesn't account for variable width fonts. Here is a more verbose script that accounts for this. The big problem with this solution is that if the element containing the text is hidden when the code is run then the width of the box isn't known. This was a deal breaker for me so I stopped working on/testing it... but I thought I'd post it here in case it is of use to someone. Be sure to test it well as my testing was less than exhaustive. I intended to add a browser check to only run the code for FF4 and let all the other browsers use their existing solution.This should be available for fiddling here:

http://jsfiddle.net/kn9Qg/130/HTML:CSS: Javascript (uses jQuery)It would be called like:I have run into this gremlin over the past week as well. Since the accepted solution does not account for variable width fonts and wwwhack's solution has a While Loop, I will throw in my $.02.I was able to drastically reduce the processing time of my problem by using cross-multiplication.  Basically, we have a formula that looks like this:The variable x in this case is what we need to solve.  When returned as an Integer, it will give the new length that the over-flowing text should be.  I multiplied the MaxLength by 80% to give the ellipses enough room to show.Here is a full html example:I understand this is a JS only fix, but until Mozilla fixes the bug, I'm just not smart enough to come up with a CSS solution.  This example works best for me because the JS is called every time a grid loads in our application.  The column-width for each grid vary and we have no control over what type of computer our Firefox users view our app (which, of course, we shouldn't have that control :) ).This pure CSS solution is really close, except for the fact that it causes ellipsis to appear after every line.

How to apply a style to an embedded SVG?

When an SVG is directly included in a document using the <svg> tag, you can apply CSS styles to the SVG via the document's stylesheet. However, I am trying to apply a style to an SVG which is embedded (using the <object> tag).Is it possible to use anything such as the following code?Short answer: no, since styles don't apply across document boundaries.However, since you have an <object> tag you can insert the stylesheet into the svg document using script.Something like this, and note that this code assumes that the <object> has loaded fully:It's also possible to insert a <link> element to reference an external stylesheet:Yet another option is to use the first method, to insert a style element, and then add an @import rule, e.g styleElement.textContent = "@import url(my-style.css)".Of course you can directly link to the stylesheet from the svg file too, without doing any scripting. Either of the following should work:or:Update 2015: you can use jquery-svg plugin for apply js scripts and css styles to an embedded SVG.You can do this without javsscrpt by putting a style block with your styles inside the SVG file itself.If the only reason for using the  tag to inlcude the SVG is that you do not want to clutter your source code with the markup from the SVG, you should take a look at SVG injectors like SVGInject. SVG injection uses Javascript to inject an SVG file inline into your HTML document. This allows for clean HTML source code while making the SVGs fully styleable with CSS. A basic example looks like this:

Let's say I've got a div that has a width of 50% of the body. How do I make its height equal to that value? So that when the browser window is 1000px wide, the div's height and width are both 500px.

Let's say I've got a div that has a width of 50% of the body. How do I make its height equal to that value? So that when the browser window is 1000px wide, the div's height and width are both 500px.This can be done with a CSS hack (see the other answers), but it can also be done very easily with JavaScript.Set the div's width to (for example) 50%, use JavaScript to check its width, and then set the height accordingly. Here's a code example using jQuery:If you want the box to scale with the browser window on resize, move the code to a function and call it on the window resize event. Here's a demonstration of that too (view example full screen and resize browser window):This can actually be done with only CSS, but the content inside the div must be absolutely positioned.  The key is to use padding as a percentage and the box-sizing: border-box CSS attribute:Adjust percentages to your liking. Here is a JSFiddleFor this to work i think you need to define the padding to ex. top? like this:anyways, thats how i got it to work, since with just padding all arround it would not be a square.I made a CSS approach to this that is sized by the viewport width, but maxes out at 100% of the viewport height. It doesn't require box-sizing:border-box. If a pseudo element cannot be used, the pseudo-code's CSS can be applied to a child.

Anyone have an idea of how I should write my CSS rules to display these variants?They use regular CSS.Just use your regular font family like this:Now you decide what "weight" the font should have by addingfor semi-boldfor bold (700)for extra bold (800)Like this its fallback proof, so if the google font should "fail" your backup font Arial/Helvetica(Sans-serif) use the same weight as the google font.Pretty smart :-)Note that the different font weights have to be specifically imported via the link tag url (family query param of the google font url) in the header.For example the following link will include both weights 400 and 700:font-family:'Open Sans' , sans-serif;For light:

font-weight : 100;

Or

font-weight : lighter;For normal:

font-weight : 500;

Or

font-weight : normal;For bold:

font-weight : 700;

Or 

font-weight : bold;For more bolder:

font-weight : 900;

Or 

font-weight : bolder;Here's the issue:  You can't specify font weights that don't exist in the font set from Google.  Click on the SEE SPECIMEN link below the font, then scroll down to the STYLES section. There you'll see each of the "styles" available for that particular font.  Sadly Google doesn't list the CSS font weights for each style.  Here's how the names map to CSS font weight numbers:Note that very few fonts come in all 9 weights.you can use the weight value specified in the Google Fonts.

The content of the div will take no room but will force the div to displayIt has width but no content or height. Add a height attribute to the class test1.There are different methods to make the empty DIV with float: left or float: right visible.Here presents the ones I know:Try to add display:block; to your test1Too late to answer, but nevertheless.While using CSS, to style the div (content-less), the min-height property must be set to "n"px to make the div visible (works with webkits and chrome, while not sure if this trick will work on IE6 and lower)Code:&#160; may do the trick; works in XSL docsYou add to this DIV's CSS position: relative, it will do all the work.

For testing purpose, add height: 100px; and check.

and also it will be better if you give overflow-y:auto; instead of overflow: auto;, because this makes the element to scroll only vertical but not horizontal.If you don't know the height of the container and you want to show vertical scrollbar when the container reaches a fixed height say 100px, use max-height instead of height property.For more information, read this MDN article.You have to add max-height property.You can set :I got an amazing scroller on my div-popup. To apply, add this style to your div element:The height you specify will be the height of the div and once if you have contents to exceed this height, you have to scroll it.Thank you.I'm not quite sure what you're attempting to use the div for, but this is an example with some random text.Mr_Green gave the correct instructions when he said to add overflow-y: auto as that restricts it to vertical scrolling.

I.e. you cannot access ../something/something.sth and changing relative path to absolute or anything else won't help.Supposing you have the following file structure:In CSS you can access image1, for example, using the line ../images/image1.png.NOTE: If you are using Chrome, it may doesn't work and you will get an error that the file could not be found. I had the same problem, so I just deleted the entire cache history from chrome and it worked.If you store stylesheets/images in a folder so that multiple websites can use them, or you want to re-use the same files on another site on the same server, I have found that my browser/Apache does not allow me to go to any parent folder above the website root URL. This seems obvious for security reasons - one should not be able to browse around on the server any place other than the specified web folders.Eg. does not work: www.mywebsite.com/../imagesAs a workaround, I use Symlinks:Go to the directory of www.mywebsite.com

How to style a <select> dropdown with CSS only without JavaScript?

As it tells there, only in Chrome and to some extent in Firefox you can achieve what you want. Otherwise, unfortunately, there is no cross browser pure CSS solution for styling a select.There is no cross-browser way of styling option elements, certainly not to the extent of your second screenshot. You might be able to make them bold, and set the font-size, but that will be about it...I've played around with select items before and without overriding the functionality with JavaScript, I don't think it's possible in Chrome. Whether you use a plugin or write your own code, CSS only is a no go for Chrome/Safari and as you said, Firefox is better at dealing with it.

Is there a way to fix a position on the x-axis only? So when a user scrolls up, the div tag will scroll up with it, but not side to side?Its a simple technique using the script also. You can check a demo here too.JQueryCSSUpdate Credit: @PierredeLESPINAYAs commented, to make the script support the changes in the css without having to recode them in the script. You can use the following.Demo :)This is an old thread but CSS3 has a solution.Have a look at this blog post.Demonstration:And this documentation.If your block is originally positioned as static, you may want to try thisNo, it's not possible with pure CSS. That kind of positioning fixes the element in the viewport. I'd suggest simply fixing the element to one of the sides of the viewport (i.e. top, bottom, left or right) so that it doesn't interfere with other content.Now that mobile is over 70% from the internet market you can create something smart and responsive to do that.You can create this very easy with only css, use a overflow-x:scroll for a container and a overflow-y:scroll for another container. You can easily position the container elements with width:100vw and height:100vh.Middle click on the example to test it. Works best on mobile because you dont see the scroll bars.Starx's solution was extremely helpful to me. But I had some problems when I tried to implement a vertical scrolling sidebar with it. Here was my initial code, based on what Starx wrote:It's slightly different from Starx's solution, because I think his code is designed to allow a menu to float horizontally instead of vertically. But that's just an aside. The problem I had with the above code is that in a lot of browsers, or depending on the resource load of the computer, the menu movements would be choppy, whereas the initial css solution was nice and smooth. I attribute this to browsers being slower at firing javascript events than at implementing css.My alternate solution to this choppiness problem is set the frame to fixed instead of absolute, then cancel out the horizontal movements using starx's method. You might say all I'm doing is trading vertical scrolling choppiness for horizontal scrolling choppiness. But the thing is, 99% of scrolling is vertical, and it's much more annoying when that is choppy than when horizontal scrolling is.Here's my related post on this matter, if I haven't already exhausted everyone's patience: Fixing a menu in one direction in jqueryI stumbled on this post looking for a nice way to keep my header/navigation bar centered and responsive to size changes.As we scroll, the bar moves upwards off the screen.

It's easy to set inline CSS values with javascript. If I want to change the width and I have html like this:All I need to do is:It will change the inline stylesheet values.

Example:Using this Javascript:I get the following:This is a problem, because not only do I not want to change inline values, If I look for the width before I set it, when I have:The value returned is Null, so if I have Javascript that needs to know the width of something to do some logic (I increase the width by 1%, not to a specific value), getting back Null when I expect the string "50%" doesn't really work.So my question: I have values in a CSS style that are not located inline, how can I get these values?

How can I modify the style instead of the inline values, given an id?Ok, it sounds like you want to change the global CSS so which will effictively change all elements of a peticular style at once.  I've recently learned how to do this myself from a Shawn Olson tutorial.  You can directly reference his code here.Here is the summary:You can retrieve the stylesheets via document.styleSheets.  This will actually return an array of all the stylesheets in your page, but you can tell which one you are on via the document.styleSheets[styleIndex].href property.  Once you have found the stylesheet you want to edit, you need to get the array of rules.  This is called "rules" in IE and "cssRules" in most other browsers.  The way to tell what CSSRule you are on is by the selectorText property.  The working code looks something like this:Let me know how this works for ya, and please comment if you see any errors.Please! Just ask w3 (http://www.quirksmode.org/dom/w3c_css.html)!

Or actually, it took me five hours... but here it is!The function is really easy to use.. example:Oh..

Gathering the code in the answers, I wrote this function that seems running well on my FF 25.This is a way to put values in the css that will be used in JS even if not understood by the browser. e.g. maxHeight for a tbody in a scrolled table.Call :CCSStylesheetRuleStyle('default', "#mydiv", "height");CCSStylesheetRuleStyle('default', "#mydiv", "color", "#EEE");I don't know why the other solutions go through the whole list of stylesheets for the document. Doing so creates a new entry in each stylesheet, which is inefficient. Instead, we can simply append a new stylesheet and simply add our desired CSS rules there.Note that we can override even inline styles set directly on elements by adding " !important" to the value of the property, unless there already exist more specific "!important" style declarations for that property.I don't have rep enough to comment so I'll format an answer, yet it is only a demonstration of the issue in question.It seems, when element styles are defined in stylesheets they are not visible to getElementById("someElement").styleThis code illustrates the issue... Code from below on jsFiddle.In Test 2, on the first call, the items left value is undefined, and so, what should be a simple toggle gets messed up. For my use I will define my important style values inline, but it does seem to partially defeat the purpose of the stylesheet.Here's the page code...I hope this helps to illuminate the issue.SkipYou can get the "computed" styles of any element.IE uses something called "currentStyle", Firefox (and I assume other "standard compliant" browsers) uses "defaultView.getComputedStyle".You'll need to write a cross browser function to do this, or use a good Javascript framework like prototype or jQuery (search for "getStyle" in the prototype javascript file, and "curCss" in the jquery javascript file).That said if you need the height or width you should probably use element.offsetHeight and  element.offsetWidth.Mind, if you add an inline style to the element in question, it can act as the "default" value and will be readable by Javascript on page load, since it is the element's inline style property:This simple 32 lines gist lets you identify a given stylesheet and change its styles very easily:I've never seen any practical use of this, but you should probably consider DOM stylesheets. However, I honestly think that's overkill.If you simply want to get the width and height of an element, irrespective of where the dimensions are being applied from, just use element.offsetWidth and element.offsetHeight.Perhaps try this:

The list still displays in IE7 (but without the close bracket and left align numbers):EDIT: Included multiple line fix by stragerRefer to list-style-type CSS property. Or when using counters the second argument accepts a list-style-type value. For example the following will use upper roman:The CSS for styling lists is here, but is basically:However, the specific layout you're after can probably only be achieved by delving into the innards of the layout with something like this (note that I haven't actually tried it):You can also specify your own numbers in the HTML - e.g. if the numbers are being provided by a database:The seq attribute is made visible using a method similar to that given in other answers. But instead of using content: counter(foo), we use content: attr(seq).Demo in CodePen with more stylingStole a lot of this from other answers, but this is working in FF3 for me. It has upper-roman, uniform indenting, a close bracket.I suggest playing with the :before attribute and seeing what you can achieve with it. It will mean your code really is limited to nice new browsers, and excludes the (annoyingly large) section of the market still using rubbish old browsers,Something like the following, which forces a fixed with on the items. Yes, I know it's less elegant to have to choose the width yourself, but using CSS for your layout is like undercover police work: however good your motives, it always gets messy.But you're going to have to experiment to find the exact solution.The numbers line up better if you add leading-zeroes to the numbers, by setting list-style-type to:Borrowed and improved Marcus Downing's answer.  Tested and works in Firefox 3 and Opera 9.  Supports multiple lines, too.There is the Type attribute which allows you to change the numbering style, however, you cannot change the full stop after the number/letter.The docs say regarding list-style-position: outsideFurther up that page is the stuff about markers.One example is:Nope... just use a DL:I have it. Try the following:The catch is that this definitely won't work on older or less compliant browsers: display: inline-block is a very new property.Quick and dirt alternative solution. You can use a tabulation character along with preformatted text. Here's a possibility:and your html:Note that the space between the li tag and the beggining of the text is a tabulation character (what you get when you press the tab key inside notepad).If you need to support older browsers, you can do this instead:The other answers are better from a conceptual point of view.  However, you can just left-pad the numbers with the appropriate number of '&ensp;' to make them line up.  * Note: I did not at first recognize that a numbered list was being used.  I thought the list was being explicitly generated.I will give here the kind of answer i usually don't like to read, but i think that as there are other answers telling you how to achive what you want, it could be nice to rethink if what you are trying to achive is really a good idea.First, you should think if it is a good idea to show the items in a non-standard way, with a separator charater diferent than the provided.I don't know the reasons for that, but let's suppose you have good reasons.The ways propossed here to achive that consist in add content to your markup, mainly trough the CSS :before pseudoclass. This content is really modifing your DOM structure, adding those items to it.When you use standard "ol" numeration, you will have a rendered content in which the "li" text is selectable, but the number preceding it is not selectable. That is, the standard numbering system seems to be more "decoration" than real content. If you add content for numbers using for example those ":before" methods, this content will be selectable, and dued to this, performing undesired vopy/paste issues, or accesibility issues with screen readers that will read this "new" content in addition to the standard numeration system.Perhaps another approach could be to style the numbers using images, although this alternative will bring its own problems (numbers not shown when images are disabled, text size for number not changing, ...).Anyway, the reason for this answer is not just to propose this "images" alternative, but to make people think in the consequences of trying to change the standard numeration system for ordered lists.This code makes numbering style same as headers of li content.Modern browsers will interpret the value attribute and will display it as you expect. See MDN documentation.Also have a look at the <ol> article on MDN, especially the documentation for the start and attribute.

How can I hide an HTML table row <tr> so that it takes up no space?  I have several <tr>'s set to style="display:none;", but they still affect the size of the table and the table's border reflects the hidden rows.I would really like to see your TABLE's styling. E.g. "border-collapse"Just a guess, but it might affect how 'hidden' rows are being rendered.Can you include some code? I add style="display:none;" to my table rows all the time and it effectively hides the entire row.You can set <tr id="result_tr" style="display: none;"> and then show it back with JavaScript:Thought I'd add to this a potential other solution:<tr style='visibility:collapse'><td>stuff</td></tr>I've only tested it on Chrome but putting this on the <tr> hides the row PLUS all the cells inside the row still contribute to the widths of the columns.  I will sometimes make an extra row at the bottom of a table with just some spacers that make it so certain columns can't be less than a certain width, then hide the row using this method.  (I know you're supposed to be able to do this with other css but I've never gotten that to work)Again, I'm in a purely chrome environment so I have no idea how this functions in other browsers.If display: none; doesn't work, how about setting height: 0; instead? In conjunction with a negative margin (equal to, or greater than, the height of the top and bottom borders, if any) to further remove the element? I don't imagine that position: absolute; top: 0; left: -4000px; would work, but it might be worth a try.For my part, using display: none works fine.Add some of the following line-height:0px;font-size:0px;height:0px;margin:0;padding:0;I forget which one does it.  I think it's line-height for IE6.I was having the same issue, I even added style="display: none" to each cell.In the end I used HTML comments 

    <!-- [HTML] -->You can use style display:none with tr to hide and it will work with all browsers.This happened to me and I was baffled as to why.  Then I noticed that if i removed any nbsp; i had within the rows, then the rows didn't take up any space.is working perfectly for me..You need to put the change the input type to hidden, all the functions of it work but it is not visible on the pageas long as the input type is set to that you can change the rest.

Good Luck!!I was having same problem and I resolved the issue.

Earlier css was overflow:hidden; z-index:999999;I change it to overflow:visible;HTML:JavaScript:position: absolute will remove it from the layout flow and should solve your problem - the element will remain in the DOM but won't affect others.You can set

At my disposal is PHP, Javascript, JQuery but I'd kill for a CSS-only solution. I don't care if it doesn't work in IE.Update 2018-04-11Here's a Javascript-less, CSS-only solution. The image will dynamically be centered and resized to fit the window.The [other, old] solution, using JQuery, sets the height of the image container (body in the example below) so that the max-height property on the image works as expected. The image will also automatically resize when the client window is resized.Note: User gutierrezalex packaged a very similar solution as a JQuery plugin on this page.Here is a simple CSS only solution (JSFiddle), works everywhere, mobile and IE included:CSS 2.0:HTML:CSS3 introduces new units that are measured relative to the viewport, which is the window in this case. These are vh and vw, which measure viewport height and width, respectively. Here is a simple CSS only solution:The one caveat to this is that it only works if there are no other elements contributing height on the page. If you are willing to put a container element around your image, a pure CSS solution is simple. You see, 99% height has no meaning when the parent element will extend vertically to contain its children. The parent needs to have a fixed height, say... the height of the viewport.HTMLCSSPlay with the fiddle.Resize Image to Fit the Screen by the Longest Side maintaining its Aspect RatioMy general lazy CSS rule:This may zoom in on your image if it is low-res to begin with (that's to do with your image quality and size in dimensions.

And NONE was from the "internal" folder (Resources/assets). It was a pre-requisite to have the spare CSS PUBLIC and then build with assetic FROM there.These are the results:So... ONLY

 - Div C

are the allowed syntaxes.Here there is the TWIG code:The container.css:And a.css, b.css, c.css, etc: all identical, just changing the color and the CSS selector.The "directories" structure is:Directories

All this came, because I did not want the individual original files exposed to the public, specially if I wanted to play with "less" filter or "sass" or similar... I did not want my "originals" published, only the compiled one.But there are good news. If you don't want to have the "spare CSS" in the public directories... install them not with --symlink, but really making a copy. Once "assetic" has built the compound CSS, and you can DELETE the original CSS from the filesystem, and leave the images:Compilation process

Note I do this for the --env=prod environment.Just a few final thoughts:BUT ANYWAY, CAUTION NOW: As now the originals are not there anymore (rm -Rf), there are only two solutions, not three. The working div "B" does not work anymore as it was an asset() call assuming there was the original asset.

So you have two choices:I'll post what worked for me, thanks to @xavi-montero.Put your CSS in your bundle's Resource/public/css directory, and your images in say Resource/public/img.Change assetic paths to the form 'bundles/mybundle/css/*.css', in your layout.In config.yml, add rule css_rewrite to assetic:Now install assets and compile with assetic:This is good enough for the development box, and --symlink is useful, so you don't have to reinstall your assets (for example, you add a new image) when you enter through app_dev.php.For the production server, I just removed the '--symlink' option (in my deployment script), and added this command at the end:All is done. With this, you can use paths like this in your .css files: ../img/picture.jpegI had the same problem and I just tried using the following as a workaround. Seems to work so far. You can even create a dummy template that just contains references to all those static assets.Notice the omission of any output which means nothing shows up on the template. When I run assetic:dump the files are copied over to the desired location and the css includes work as expected.If it can help someone, we have struggled a lot with Assetic, and we are now doing the following in development mode:I offen manage css/js plugin with composer which install it under vendor.

2012-09-29 22:17:33Z

Is there a way to use Sass or Compass or anything like that without Ruby? I have been looking around google and this site and can't find anything, any help would be appreciated. Thank youSass was originally written for Ruby, but now they've created libSass which is a C/C++ port of the Sass engine, which makes it easier to integrate the engine into an IDE or another language. At this point, you can use the Sass engine in Ruby, Node.js, Python, PHP, Java, .NET and others. For more information, visit libSass. Also, your IDE might have a plugin which would support Sass, without the need of ruby by using the libSass.The original answer below may or may not apply to your situation (depends on whether or not your language has implemented support for libSass or not). I decided to leave it the way it is for archive reasons.Sass (requires Ruby)Compass (requires Ruby, as it's based on SASS)Less (written in js, requires node.js or less.js included in the page)These are the main processors out there that I know of.

You may write your own parser/port for any another language of choice.In other words, no you can't use sass/compass without having Ruby because the program itself (sass & compass) IS written in Ruby. So you'll definitely need it in order to run it.It's true that the question is not clear enough, but i'll try to address some issues. There are other CSS pre-processors that don't rely on Ruby (two coming to my mind right now are Less, which i've used and liked, but not as powerful as Sass, and Stylus, which i haven't used, both based on JavaScript), but as you're specifically asking about Sass+Compass, and as i'm still looking for the same answer, i'll talk about that.@JamundFerguson said:Sass is a pre-processing language. There's a compiler built in Ruby for it and anyone can write a compiler in any language. There's a C implementation of a Sass compiler called libsass which can be used on any language that allows to import C libs. It's the library used by node-sass, which is a compiler built in Node.js, which I didn't tried yet and don't know how it could work and if it's ready for production use. It may be a question of time for Compass to be ported (maybe you end up doing that?) and so we can have a compiler which doesn't depends on the Ruby gem (currently, there's a node-compass module that does relies on the Ruby gem).So far i've mentioned the possibility for a Node.js compiler, which, as you may know, it's a JavaScript environment, being the language of the web and my language of choice. But you didn't specified which language you would like the compiler to be written into. I think there may be compilers built in many languages, for example, @EricMeyer mentioned a Python compiler. Maybe he's using pyScss? That seems to have built-in support for Compass. But then you need a Python environment. So the thing is: you'll need some environment for a compiler unless you run natively compiled binaries. (Less has less.js which can be included on the page to run client-side and avoid the compiling step, but it's not meant for using it on production.)I've worked for a year with CodeKit, which does very well, compiles Sass/Compass, Less, Stylus and template languages like Haml, Slim, Jade, etc. Rebuilds your assets when they change automatically and you see the changed on your browser immediately. The only thing that i didn't liked was that when moving to a different computer, installing CodeKit, checking out project and trying to use it, i had to reconfigure the project settings, which i had to remember so i could get to a build like the one i made in the other computer. Also i started working with a team, and they had also to configure the project with the same settings (sometimes not having the same project config lead to ugly inconsistencies) and also members of the team using Ubuntu couldn't use it. That's why i started to think on making a command-line tool to build projects and discovered Grunt immediately, and fell in love with it.

As @Dave mentioned, there's Scout and also there's LiveReload, but haven't used them.Conclusion is i have not a strong conclusion. I'm still looking for the same answer, but i hope this answer sheds a little bit of light on the status of compiling Sass/Compass outside of the Ruby environment.Actually there is a library that provides binding for Node.js to libsass, the C version of the Sass: https://npmjs.org/package/node-sassIt allows you to natively compile .scss files to css at incredible speed without Ruby installed.To install just run:And there is also a Grunt extension if needed: https://github.com/sindresorhus/grunt-sass (this is what I've been looking for in this question)Find out more at: https://github.com/andrew/node-sassJust a little bit of an update on this, you can use SCSS/SASS files and generate the correct files on the fly without installing Ruby by using a program called Scout.Scout has its own self contained ruby environment and is coded in java so make sure you java is up to date before using. Linky here.Regards :)You can actually parse sass without ruby, you can use node-sass.

details here: https://github.com/andrew/node-sassIf this is for .NET, there is now a wrapper for libsass. Available from Nuget.Adobe Brackets (free, open source)  can compile LESS, SASS and Stylus when the files are changed, and update styles during live preview, you just need to install required extensions from the extension manager.

Get Brackets and enjoy !Edit: As other questions suggest node-sass is also a good option if you have nodejs already installed.

[Export CSS changes from inspector (webkit, firebug, etc)](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3355111/export-css-changes-from-inspector-webkit-firebug-etc)

When I'm working with CSS, I'll often test in a browser - say, Chrome - right click an element, click Inspect Element, and edit the CSS right there. The use of arrow keys to change things like margin and padding makes lining things up super easy.It's not too hard to then take those changes and apply them to the CSS file, but it would be cool if I could just right click the selector in the inspector and select "export" or "copy", and have the contents available in my clipboard.Does something like this exist?

While in the Elements section, just click on the "filename:linenumber" link next to the CSS rules.  The CSS file that shows up will contain all of the modifications.This place exactly:In Chrome, you can right-click a CSS file in the Sources tab and click "Local Modifications"This shows you all of your local changes. Each revision is timestamped and you can rollback to  any previous revision.See the Live Editing and Revision History section of this tutorial.Firediff is a Firebug add-on that tracks changes done in Firebug. It logs everything you'll do in the HTML pane (great) but also your brief use of the Web Developer Toolbar extension (not so great), say Shift-Ctrl-F to obtain a font-size information in px.I have seen a Firebug extension in Chrome but didn't test it, I use Firediff with Firefox.I've suggested this product on SO before (I'm not affiliated with them in any way).http://www.skybound.ca/Excellent product. Sounds like exactly what you're looking for and much more.EDIT: Several other answers here have mentioned Google Chrome's ability to link to your local files (which is very very cool). Check out the other answers!I built a Chrome extension that does exactly this.It's called StyleURL - it takes whatever CSS changes you made in Chrome Inspector and outputs valid CSS as the diff: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/styleurl/emplcligcppnlalfjknjbanolhlnkmgpHere's an example where I added "padding-bottom: 50px" to this page:

It's open-source and on GitHub too: https://github.com/Jarred-Sumner/styleurl-extensionIf you edit external CSS, then you can drag its latest revision out of the Resources panel into any text editor that supports DnD (see http://www.webkit.org/blog/1463/web-inspector-styles-enhanced/, the "Persisting Changes" section for more detail.) You can also revert your CSS changes to any earlier version of the stylesheet resource (in the right-click popup menu of any stylesheet revision.)As mentioned by cloudworks, the answer to this has changed. This can now be accomplished rather well by the Chrome DevTools Autosave extension. This tool tracks CSS and JavaScript changes made within the Chrome Developer Tools console, and saves them back to local files. For instructions to install and setup the extension, please refer to the guide written by @addyosmani on his blog, here.There is also a handy screencast which details the extension rather well.With Workspaces you can have your CSS saved as you type them in your inspector (in Chrome). The problem is that every change is automatically saved and there's no way to disable this feature, as pointed in http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/developertools/revolutions2013/ and Disable automatic saving of CSS changes in Chrome Developer Tools. In Chrome there is also the Changes tab in the console drawer that displays all the modifications of CSS. It's not an export, but at least it is very convenient to quickly grasp what has changed. If you're using the Firefox stock dev tools you can edit the css directly in the tools dialog - click the CSS viewport button (that's the button at the top with the {} symbol) and edit your css directly. It will update in realtime in the browser and when you're done just copy-paste it directly into your css file. Nice!To add an answer for Safari specifically — it's kind of possible.When you edit CSS in the Styles section in the Inspector for an existing CSS file, you can hit Cmd-S to re-save the entire file with the changes.  However, if you're using a meta language like Sass / preprocessor / generating your CSS with bundling etc, I don't think this really solves that problem, though it may be possible with CSS source maps.When you edit CSS at the top of the Styles section, under Style Attribute to add inline styles (not tied to an existing CSS file), it doesn't seem possible to easily export all of those changes.  For now, I'm just copying and pasting the overrides manually for each element.The official Apple docs are a little dated but found here: Web Inspector Tutorial - Editing Code to Change Your Webpage.In Chrome, in the css inspector you can click and hold the + button, then choose to add your changes to the inspector-stylesheet.  It's not as convenient as directly editing in your css-selectors, but what you write will all be in inspector-stylesheet.cssMy in-beta-soon product LIVEditor does this exactly.To let you understand it easily, you can think of Firebug's inspector is embedded into your text editor.That way you don't have to make the changes manually again in your code editor after you tweaking it using Firebug or Webkit's developer tools.

CSS border less than 1px [duplicate]

The default border:1px is too big. However, border: 0.5px solid; is not working. 

Is there a CSS solution that would make the border half the size?

The default border:1px is too big. However, border: 0.5px solid; is not working. 

Is there a CSS solution that would make the border half the size? A pixel is the smallest unit value to render something with, but you can trick thickness with optical illusions by modifying colors (the eye can only see up to a certain resolution too).Here is a test to prove this point:Which gives the illusion that the last DIV has a smaller border width, because the blue border blends more with the white background.Alpha values may also be used to simulate the same effect, without the need to calculate and manipulate RGB values.It's impossible to draw a line on screen that's thinner than one pixel. Try using a more subtle color for the border instead.try giving border in % for exapmle 0.1% according to your need.The minimum width that your screen can display is 1 pixel. So its impossible to display less then 1px. 1 pixels can only have 1 color and cannot be split up.You can still define the border attribute and give it a value of 0 pixels, useful when one side needs this value.Examples:

Retina displays, high-res background images

[Retina displays, high-res background images](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/16154494/retina-displays-high-res-background-images)

This might sound like a silly question.If I use this CSS snippet for regular displays (Where box-bg.png is 200px by 200px);and if I use a media query like this to target retina displays (With the @2x image being the high-res version); Do I need to double the size of the .box div to 400px by 400px to match the new high res background image?

This min--moz-device-pixel-ratio: is not a typo. It is a well documented bug in certain versions of Firefox and should be written like this in order to support older versions (prior to Firefox 16).

- SourceAs @LiamNewmarch mentioned in the comments below, you can include the background-size in your shorthand background declaration  like so:However, I personally would not advise using the shorthand form as it is not supported in   iOS <= 6 or Android making it unreliable in most situations.Here's a solution that also includes High(er)DPI (MDPI) devices > ~160 dots per inch like quite a few non-iOS Devices (f.e.: Google Nexus 7 2012):As @3rror404 included in his edit after receiving feedback from the comments, there's a world beyond Webkit/iPhone. One thing that bugs me with most solutions around so far like the one referenced as source above at CSS-Tricks, is that this isn't taken fully into account.

The original source went already further.As an example the Nexus 7 (2012) screen is a TVDPI screen with a weird device-pixel-ratio of 1.325. When loading the images with normal resolution they are upscaled via interpolation and therefore blurry. For me applying this rule in the media query to include those devices succeeded in  best customer feedback.If you are planing to use the same image for retina and non-retina screen then here is the solution. Say that you have a image of 200x200 and have two icons in top row and two icon in bottom row. So, it's four quadrants.Scaling and positioning of the sprite icons to 50% than actual value, you can get the expected result.Another handy SCSS mixin solution by Ryan Benhase.For more info about above mixin READ HERE. 

CSS :after not adding content to certain elements

I'm having trouble understanding the behavior of the CSS :after property. According to the spec (here and here):This doesn't seem to place restrictions on which elements can have a :after (or :before) property. However, it seems to only work with specific elements... <p> works, <img> doesn't, <input> doesn't, <table> does. I'm could test more, but the point is made. Note that this seems pretty consistent across browsers. What determines whether an object can accept a :before and :after property?img and input are both replaced elements.:before and :after only work with non-replaced elements.From the spec:With span:before, span:after, the DOM looks like this:Evidently, that won't work with <img src="" />.:before and :after are not required to work for replaced elements, and CSS specifications do not specify how they would work for them, and the concept of replaced element is somewhat vague.The CSS 2.1 specification clearly suggests that they can work for replaced elements, just saying that it does not「fully define」how. This relates to the issue that a replaced element is expected to have its own visual rendering, which is not controlled by CSS, whereas the pseudo-elements should add something to the content of the element. The spec adds that this will be defined「in more detail」in a future specification, but this has not taken place so far.Browser vendors just decided to avoid problems by not implementing these pseudo-elements for some elements at all.It is not clear at all what「replaced element」means, and the meaning appears to have changed somewhat. It is often interpreted as meaning the same as empty element (an element with EMPTY declared content, i.e. an element that cannot have any content), but CSS 2.1 itself shows a sample style sheet with the selector br:before (though browsers have ignored this, implementing br their own way). It can be argued that more and more elements have moved into the scope of CSS rendering, at least in part. For example, an input element (incuding its font, colors, etc.) is largely controllable with CSS in modern browsers.Current browsers (Firefox, IE, Chrome) do not seem to support the :after and :before pseudo-elements for empty elements other than hr. For hr, IE and Chrome place the generated content inside a bordered box, which is the implementation of hr; the content makes the box taller. Firefox places the content of both (!) pseudo-elements after the horizontal rule that is its implementation of hr. This variation illustrates the kinds of「interaction」problems that are referred to in CSS 2.1.It is often claimed that these pseudo-elements cannot be used for empty elements since their HTML definitions do not allow any content. This is a category error. The syntax rules of a markup language do not restrict what you can do in CSSTo conclude, :after and :before are currently not usable for empty elements (except marginally for hr), but this is mainly due to implementations and may change in the future.Elements that doesn't have closing tag are void elements and they can't display content inside them:https://www.w3.org/TR/html5/syntax.html#void-elementsAll Blink, Webkit and Quantum browsers allow you to create pseudo elements only on checkboxes but this is controversial since no spec allow this behavior.Here an example:

How do I set the size of an HTML text box?

2010-01-24 01:24:04Z

How do I set the size of an HTML text box?Just use:orDepending on what you mean by 'textbox'.Your markup:The CSS:Keep in mind that text box size is a "victim" of the W3C box model. What I mean by victim is that the height and width of a text box is the sum of the height/width properties assigned above, in addition to the padding height/width, and the border width. For this reason, your text boxes will be slightly different sizes in different browsers depending on the default padding in different browsers. Although different browsers tend to define different padding to text boxes, most reset style sheets don't tend to include <input /> tags in their reset sheets, so this is something to keep in mind.You can standardize this by defining your own padding. Here is your CSS with specified padding, so the text box looks the same in all browsers:I added 1 pixel padding because some browsers tend to make the text box look too crammed if the padding is 0px. Depending on your design, you may want to add even more padding, but it is highly recommend you define the padding yourself, otherwise you'll be leaving it up to different browsers to decide for themselves. For even more consistency across browsers, you should also define the border yourself.Your textbox code:Your CSS code:orSo, first you select your element with attributes (look at first example) or classes(look last example). Later, you assign height and width values to your element.This works for me in IE 10 and FF 23If you don't want to use the class method you can use parent-child method to make changes in the text box.For eg. I've made a form in my form div. HTML Code: Now CSS code will be like:Problem solved. Lookout! The width attribute is clipped by the max-width attribute.

So I used....Try:This is way it remains independent of what textsize has been set for the textbox. You are increasing the height using padding instead Try this code :This way it remains independent of what textsize has been set for the textbox. You are increasing the height using padding instead.Elements can be sized with the height and width attributes.You can make the dependent input width versus container width.

You will have to hover the mouse over the button and thus cannot use it (mouse) in the inspector. Are there any shortcuts or other ways to accomplish this in the inspector?Now you can see both the pseudo-class style rules and force them on elements. To see the rules like :hover in the Styles pane click the small dotted box button in the top right.To force an element into :hover state, right click it.Alternatively, you can use Event Listener Breakpoints sidebar pane in the Scripts panel and select to pause in mouseover handlers.Alternatively, you can use Event Listener Breakpoints sidebar pane in the Scripts panel and select to pause in mouseover handlers.It's a little annoying, but you need to right click on the element, and then, keeping your mouse over the link, use your keyboard select the 'Inspect Element' link and press enter. This should show you the css for the hover pseudo class for the selected element.Here's hoping they make this a little easier in future builds. You can also mouseover on an element, and then click CTRL+SHIFT+C to inspect that element.in firebug:source: https://stackoverflow.com/a/11272205/2165415I'm not sure that I right understand your question but if you want to see the event handler code you can just inspect the element and look at Event Listeners sidebar pane of Elements Panel.

Another way is just press pause button in Scripts Panel and just hover the element.

The debugger will stop at the first instruction of the first event handler.Please have a look on below link for answerSee :hover state in Chrome Developer Tools
