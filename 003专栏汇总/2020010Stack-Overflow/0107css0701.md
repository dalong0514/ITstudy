I'm using twitter bootstrap for some web app I'm forced to do (I'm not a web developer) and I can't find a way to disable the row lines for tables.As you can see from the Bootstrap documentation, the default table style contains line rows.Regards,Add this to your main CSS:Use this for newer versions of bootstrap:In Bootstrap 3 I've added a table-no-border classbootstrap.min.css is more specific than your own stylesheet if you just use .table td. So use this instead:This is what worked for me..Had to whip out the !important to make it stick.Got the same question from a friend. My suggestion which does not require !Important looks like this: I add a custom class "no-border" which can be added to the bootstrap table.You can see my go at a solution hereThe other way around, if you have problems ADDING the lines to your panel dont forget to add the  to your TABLE.

By default (http://getbootstrap.com/components/#panels), it is suppose to add the line but It helped me to add the  tag so now the row lines are shown.The following example "probably" wont display the lines between rows:The following example WILL display the lines between rows:

CSS to make an empty cell's border appear?

[CSS to make an empty cell's border appear?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57002/css-to-make-an-empty-cells-border-appear)

What CSS should I use to make a cell's border appear even if the cell is empty?IE 7 specifically.

2008-09-11 16:08:06Z

What CSS should I use to make a cell's border appear even if the cell is empty?IE 7 specifically.If I recall, the cell dosn't exist in some IE's unless it's filled with something...If you can put a &nbsp; (non-breaking space) to fill the void, that will usually work. Or do you require a pure CSS solution?Apparently, IE8 shows the cells by default, and you have to hide it with empty-cells:hide But it doesn't work at all in IE7 (which hides by default).Another way of making sure there is data in all cells: If you set the border-collapse property to collapse, IE7 will show empty cells. It also collapses the borders though so this might not be 100% what you wantThe question asked for a CSS solution, but on the off-chance an HTML solution will do, here is one:Try adding these two attributes to the table element:     frame="box" rules="all"

like this:I just found the following. It's standards compliant but it doesn't work in IE. sigh.I happened across this question and haven't seen any answers that really addressed the issue.The problem results because IE7 does not see any internal content for the cell; in programming terms the cell is resulting as a null and like most things, you cannot border a null or perform any action on it.  The browser needs an element/object that has a layout, in order to apply a border/layout.Even empty <div></div> or <span></span> do not contain content, thus there is nothing to render, resulting in that null case again.However, you can trick the browser into thinking the cell has content, by giving the empty div/span layout properties.  The easiest way is to apply the CSS style zoom:1.This workaround is better than using a &nbsp;, since it doesn't unnecessarily mess up screen readers, and isn't misrepresenting the value of the cell.  In newer browser you can use the empty-cell:<show|hide> alternative.Note: in lieu of Tomalak's comment, it should be understood that hasLayout has nothing to do with null, it was merely a comparison of how the browser interacts and renders hasLayout similarly to how a database or programming language interacts with nulls.  It is a strech, but I thought it might be easier to understand for those programmers turned web designers.Ideally, you shouldn't have any empty cells in a table. Either you have a table of data, and there's no data in that specific cell (which you should indicate with "-", or "n/a/", or something equally appropriate, or - if you must - &nbsp;, as suggested), or you have a cell that needs to span a column or row, or you're trying to achieve some layout with a table that you should be using CSS for.Can we have a bit more detail?This question's old, but still a top result in Google, so I'll add what I've found:Simply adding border-collapse: collapse to the table style fixed this problem for me in IE7 (and didn't affect the way they're displayed in FF, Chrome, etc).Best to avoid the extraneous code of adding an &nbsp; or other spacing element when you can fix with CSS.I guess this can't be done with CSS;

You need to put a &nbsp; in every empty cell for the border to show in IE...empty-cell only fixed Firefox (YES I really did have this issue in Firefox) IE 7 & 8 were still problematic..This worked for me in both Firefox 3.6.x, IE 7 & 8, Chrome, and Safari:============================================================Had to use the * to make sure the table style was only applied to the IE browser.Try this if you can't use non-breakable space:I create a div style that has the same font color as the background of your cell and write anything (usually a "-" "n/a" or "empty") to give the cell content. It shows up if you highlight the page, but when viewed normally looks how you want.I use a mix of html and css to create cross browser table grids:html<table cellspacing="1" style="background-color:#000;" border="0">cssI haven't seen any issues with any browsers so far."IE" isn't a useful term in this context anymore now that IE8 is out.IE7 always does "empty-cells:show" (or so I'm told ... Vista).

IE8 in any of its "Quirks" or "IE7 Standards" modes always does "empty-cells:hide".

IE8 in "Standards" mode defaults to "empty-cells:show" and supports the attribute via CSS.As far as I know, every other browser has correctly supported this for several years (I know it was added in Firefox 2).I'm taking this from another website but:Use for the CSS for the table and TD element respectively.

If you are to ignore IE6, you could do (CSS2.1):CSS3 (IE9+):You can substitute [disabled=disabled] (attribute value) with [disabled] (attribute presence).As said by jensgram, IE6 does not support attribute selector.

You probably finally realized this between posting this question and today, but the very nature of selectors makes it impossible to navigate through hierarchically unrelated HTML elements.Or, to put it simply, since you said in your comment that... it's just not possible with selectors alone, without modifying the markup in some way as shown by the other answers.You have to use the jQuery .eq() solution.use nth-child(item number)

EXOR:nth-of-type(item number)

same your codeYes, you can do this.  For example, to style the td tags that make up the different columns of a table you could do something like this:This isn't so much an answer as a non-answer, i.e. an example showing why one of the highly voted answers above is actually wrong.I thought that answer looked good. In fact, it gave me what I was looking for: :nth-of-type which, for my situation, worked. (So, thanks for that, @Bdwey.)I initially read the comment by @BoltClock (which says that the answer is essentially wrong) and dismissed it, as I had checked my use case, and it worked. Then I realized @BoltClock had a reputation of 300,000+(!) and has a profile where he claims to be a CSS guru. Hmm, I thought, maybe I should look a little closer.Turns out as follows: div.myclass:nth-of-type(2) does NOT mean "the 2nd instance of div.myclass". Rather, it means "the 2nd instance of div, and it must also have the 'myclass' class". That's an important distinction when there are intervening divs between your div.myclass instances.It took me some time to get my head around this. So, to help others figure it out more quickly, I've written an example which I believe demonstrates the concept more clearly than a written description: I've hijacked the h1, h2, h3 and h4 elements to essentially be divs. I've put an A class on some of them, grouped them in 3's, and then colored the 1st, 2nd and 3rd instances blue, orange and green using h?.A:nth-of-type(?). (But, if you're reading carefully, you should be asking "the 1st, 2nd and 3rd instances of what?"). I also interjected a dissimilar (i.e. different h level) or similar (i.e. same h level) un-classed element into some of the groups.Note, in particular, the last grouping of 3. Here, an un-classed h3 element is inserted between the first and second h3.A elements. In this case, no 2nd color (i.e. orange) appears, and the 3rd color (i.e. green) shows up on the 2nd instance of h3.A. This shows that the n in h3.A:nth-of-type(n) is counting the h3s, not the h3.As.Well, hope that helps. And thanks, @BoltClock.Perhaps using the "~" selector of CSS?See my example on jsfiddle

I want to disable Pinch and Zoom on Mobile devices.What configuration should I add to the viewport ?Link : http://play.mink7.com/n/dawn/EDIT: Because this keeps getting commented on, we all know that we shouldn't do this. The question was how do I do it, not should I do it.Add this into your  for mobile devices. Then do your widths in percentages and you'll be fine:Add this in for devices that can't use viewport too:This is all I needed:    To everyone who said that this is a bad idea I want to say it is not always a bad one. Sometimes it is very boring to have to zoom out to see all the content. For example when you type on an input on iOS it zooms to get it in the center of the screen. You have to zoom out after that cause closing the keyboard does not do the work. Also I agree that when you put many I hours in making a great layout and user experience you don't want it to be messed up by a zoom. But the other argument is valuable as well for people with vision issues. However In my opinion if you have issues with your eyes you are already using the zooming features of the system so there is no need to disturb the content. Unfortunately, the offered solution doesn't work in Safari 10+, since Apple has decided to ignore user-scalable=no. This thread has more details and some JS hacks: disable viewport zooming iOS 10+ safari?this will prevent any zoom action by the user in ios safari and also prevent the "zoom to tabs" feature:jsfiddle: https://jsfiddle.net/vo0aqj4y/11/IE has its own way: A css property, -ms-content-zooming. Setting it to none on the body or something should disable it.Disable pinch to zoom in IE10http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ie/hh771891(v=vs.85).aspxFound here you can use user-scalable=no:Try with min-width property. Let me explain you. Assume a device with screen width of 400px (for an instance). When you zoom in, the fonts gets larger and larger. But boxes and divs remains with same width. If you use min-width,  you can avoid decreasing your div and box.

It's not necessary that they look exactly like toggle buttons.How can I do this only with CSS and HTML?EDIT: I will be satisfied making the little circle disappear and changing the style when the button is checked/unchecked.Depending on which browsers you aim to support, you could use the :checked pseudo-class selector in addition to hiding the radio buttons.Using this HTML:You could use something like the following CSS:For instance, (to keep the custom CSS brief) if you were using Bootstrap, you might add class="btn" to your <label> elements and style them appropriately to create a toggle that looks like:...which just requires the following additional CSS:I've included this as well as the extra fallback styles in a radio button toggle jsFiddle demo. Note that :checked is only supported in IE 9, so this approach is limited to newer browsers.However, if you need to support IE 8 and are willing to fall back on JavaScript*, you can hack in pseudo-support for :checked without too much difficulty (although you can just as easily set classes directly on the label at that point).Using some quick and dirty jQuery code as an example of the workaround:You can then make a few changes to the CSS to complete things:*If you're using Modernizr, you can use the :selector test to help determine if you need the fallback. I called my test "checkedselector" in the example code, and the jQuery event handler is subsequently only set up when the test fails.Here's my version of that nice CSS solution JS Fiddle example posted above.http://jsfiddle.net/496c9/HTMLCSSStyled with coloured buttons :)Example Image (you can run the code below):After looking for something really clean and straight forward, I ended up building this with ONE simple change from another code that was  built only thinking on checkboxes, so I tryed the funcionality for RADIOS and it worked too(!).The CSS (SCSS) is fully from @mallendeo (as established on the JS credits), what I did was simply change the type of the input to RADIO, and gave the same name to all the radio switches.... and VOILA!! They deactivate automatically one to the other!!Very clean, and as you asked it's only CSS and HTML!!It is exactly what I was looking for since 3 days after trying and editing more than a dozen of options (which mostly requiered jQuery, or didn't allow labels, or even wheren't really compatible with current browsers).

I also included 2 labels for each radio, one before and one after.

That approach also means you can keep things accessible for users who aren't on a normal web browser-- just hide your ul by default and show the radio buttons.I know this is an old question, but since I was just looking to do this, I thought I would post what I ended up with.

If I have:then will stretch to fill that space. I want the image to stay the same size, but for it to take up that much space in the DOM. Do I have to add an encapsulating <div> or <span>? I hate adding markup for styling.Yes you need an encapsulating div:with something like:Other solutions (padding, margin) are more tedious (in that you need to calculate the right value based on the image's dimensions) but also don't effectively allow the container to be smaller than the image.Also, the above can be adapted much more easily for different layouts. For example, if you want the image at the bottom right:2017 answerCSS object fit works in all current browsers. It allows the img element to be larger without stretching the image. You can add object-fit: cover; to your CSS.Load the image as a background for a div.Instead of:doAll browsers will crop the part of the image that doesn't fit.

This has several advantages over wrapping it an element whose overflow is hidden:Update: This answer is from before object-fit; you should now probably use object-fit/object-position. It is still useful for older browsers, for extra properties (such as background-repeat), and for edge cases (For example, workaround Chrome bugs with flexbox and object-position and FF's (former?) issues with grid + autoheight + object-fit. Wrapper divs in grid / flexbox often give... unintuitive results.)CSS3 object-fit Am not sure how far its been implemented by webkit, IE and firefox.

The only thing that comes to mind is padding, but for that you would have to know the image's dimensions beforehand.You can use as below :you can try setting the padding instead of the height/width.What I can think of is to stretch either width or height and let it resize in ratio-aspect.

The color: transparent; covers an issue with Webkit browsers still displaying 1px of the text.Wrap the text in a span and set visibility:hidden; Visibility hidden will hide the element but it will still take up the same space on the page (conversely display: none removes it from the page as well).Tends to work well from my exprience.Mini tip:I had the following scenario:I hided the text with font-size: 0, so I could use a FontAwesome icon for it. This worked on Chrome 36, Firefox 31 and IE9+.I wouldn't recommend color: transparent because the text stil exists and is selectable.

Using line-height: 0px didn't allow me to use :after. Maybe because my element was a inline-block.Visibility: hidden: Didn't allow me to use :after.text-indent: -9999px;:  Also moved the :after elementWorks flawlessly. Another option is to hide based on bootstraps "sr-only" class.  If you wrap the text in a span with the class "sr-only" then the text will not be displayed, but screen readers will still have access to it.  So you would have:If you are not using bootstrap, still keep the above, but also add the below css to define the "sr-only" class:I have followed the best answer of Loktar and it worked very well. The only problem I had was with Chrome (my current version is 27.0.1453.94 m).

The problem I had was that it seems Chrome is aware that the text in the link is not visible and it puts the link a little bit lower then it is supposed to be (something like margin-top, but it is not possible to change it).

This happens with all the ways in which we make the text invisible:

- line-height: 0; 

- font-size: 0;

- text-indent:-9999px;I was able to fix this problem by adjusting the vertical-align of the link like this:I hope this is helpfulJust need to add font-size: 0; to your element that contains text.

This works well.You can put an image into ::before pseudoelement and set the same  dimensions for  as is the image + add overflow:hidden, like:I was able to fix this problem by setting  font-size: 0 . How about display: none;That hides anything.

wwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww What can I add to the above string to fit it neatly within a few lines in a div or within the browser window?This question has been asked here before:Long story short:As far as CSS solutions go you have: overflow: scroll; to force the element to show scrollbars and overflow:hidden; to just cut off any extra text. There is text-overflow:ellipsis; and word-wrap: break-word; but they are IE only (break-word is in the CSS3 draft, however, so it will be the solution to this 5 years from now).Bottom line is that if it is very important for you to stop this from happening with wrapping the text over to the next line the only reasonable solution is to inject  &shy; (soft hyphen), <wbr> (word break tag), or &#8203; (zero-width space, same effect as &shy; minus hyphen) in your string server side. If you don't mind Javascript, however, there is the hyphenator which seems to be pretty solid.word-wrap: break-word; is available in IE7+, FF 3.5 and Webkit enabled browsers (Safari/Chrome etc). To handle IE6 you will also need to declare word-wrap: break-all;If FF 2.0 is not on your browser matrix then using these is a viable solution. Unfortunately it does not hyphenate the preceding line where the word is broken which is a typographical nightmare. I would suggest using the Hyphenator as suggested by Paolo which is unobtrusive JavaScript. The fall-back for non JavaScript enabled users will then be the broken word without hyphens. I can live with that for the time being. This problem will most likely arise in a CMS, where the web designer does not have control over what content will be entered or where line-breaks and soft-hyphens may be implemented.I have taken a look at the W3 specification where hyphenation in CSS3 is discussed. Unfortunately it appears there are a few suggestions but nothing concrete yet. It appears the browser vendors are yet to implement anything either yet. I have checked both Mozilla and Webkit for proprietory code but there is no sign of any.word-break:break-all works a treatJust mentioned this over here but probably more relevant to this question. The best property shortly will be overflow-wrap. and the best value if it gets implemented would be:Doesen't seem to be supported in any way just yet at the time of writing on the iphone or firefox, and overflow-wrap:hyphenate isn't even in the working draft. in the meantime i'd use:I use the code for preventing all long strings, urls and so on..Hopefully someday we'll get access to the word-wrap property in CSS3: Force Wrapping: the 'word-wrap' property.Someday...Normally Cells will do this naturally, but you could force this behavior on a div with:Always specify line-height property - if you don't specify, it might cause the failure of your word-break: break-all; property.It seems that this does the trick for latest Chrome:I have not checked any browsers but Chrome.

Why is the margin:top for 'Main Data' not working in the code above?

2010-11-16 19:46:33Z

Why is the margin:top for 'Main Data' not working in the code above?You could put the two floated divs into another one that's got "overflow: hidden" set:edit — To add a bit to this 5-year-old answer: I think the cause of the confusing behavior is the somewhat complicated process of margin collapse. A good trick with the original HTML from the OP is to add a CSS rule like this:Poof!  Now (without my additional <div>) it works fine! Well, except for that extra pixel from the borders. In particular, I think it's a combination of the way that clear: both works and the margin collapse rules that result in the unexpected layout from the code in the OP.edit again — For the complete (and, I think, completely accurate) story, see Mark Amery's excellent answer. The details have some complexity that this answer glosses over.While Pointy shows how you can wrap the floats in a div, alternatively you can insert an empty div between the floats and the main data section. For example:This might prove useful in cases where adding a div wrapper around some HTML is not desirable.The logic behind this in the spec is mind-bending, and involves a complicated interaction of the rules for clearance and collapsing margins.You're probably familiar with the conventional CSS box model, in which the content box is contained within a padding box contained within a border box contained within a margin box:For elements with clear set to something other than none, an additional component may be introduced to this model: clearance.In other words, the box model in those cases really looks more like this:But when is clearance introduced, and how big should it be? Let's start with the first of those questions. The spec says:Let's apply this logic to the question asker's code. Remember, we're trying to explain the position of the third div in the code below (backgrounds added to aid in visualisation):Let us imagine, as the spec asks us to, that clear is set to none on the third div, instead of both. Then what would the snippet above look like?Here, the third div is overlapping the two floated divs. But wait; why is this so? Sure, it's allowable for floated elements to overlap block-level ones (per the Floats spec, "Since a float is not in the flow, non-positioned block boxes created before and after the float box flow vertically as if the float did not exist."), but our third div has loads of margin-top on it, and comes after the two floated divs; shouldn't the two floated divs appear at the top of the body, and the third div appear 200px down, well below them?The reason this doesn't occur is that the margin of the third div collapses into the margin of the divs' parent (in this case, the body - but the same behaviour happens if you wrap all three divs in a parent div). The Collapsing margins spec (quoted below with several irrelevant details omitted) tells us that:The third div in our example certainly isn't the body's first child, but it is its first in-flow child. Note that per https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS22/visuren.html#positioning-scheme:Since the first and second div in our example are floated, only the third div is in-flow. Thus its top margin adjoins the top margin of its parent, and the margins collapse - pushing down the entire body, including the two floated elements. Thus the third div overlaps its siblings despite having a large margin-top. Consequently - in this hypothetical case, where the third element's clear is set to none - we satisfy the condition that:Thus:How much clearance? The spec gives browsers two options, with a couple of clarifying notes:Before we can start applying these rules, we immediately hit a complication. Remember that collapsing margin that we had to take into account in the hypothetical case where clear was none? Well, it doesn't exist in this non-hypothetical case where we're calculating the clearance to use, because the existence of the clearance inhibits it. Recall the collapsing margin rules from 8.3.1, quoted earlier, dictate that margins are only adjoining if:(emphasis added). As such, the third div's top margin and the top margin of its parent are no longer adjoining. We can simulate this pre-clearance scenario in our example snippet by keeping clear: none but adding padding-top: 1px to the body, which also disables margin collapse, per the rule quoted above.Now, unlike when the margins were collapsed, our third div is comfortably below its two floated siblings. But we have already decided, based upon a hypothetical scenario where the margins did collapse, that clearance must be added; all that remains is to choose the amount of clearance, in order to:And so we have no choice but to apply a negative clearance to the third div, in order to drag its top border edge up to touch the bottom outer edge (also known as margin edge) of the floated elements above it. As such, if the floated elements are each 10px high and the third div has 200px of top margin, -190px of clearance will be applied. That, at last, gets us to the final result seen by the question asker:(Note that if you inspect the third div in the snippet above using your browser's dev tools, you will still be able to see the 200px of top margin above the div, going way out above all the rest of the content - it's just that the entire margin box has been hauled upwards by the large negative clearance.)Simple!Pointy and Randall Cook have excellent answers.  I thought I'd show one more solution.  If you make the 3rd element "float: left;" AND "clear: both;", it should have the desired effect of giving the 3rd element a 200 pixel margin.  Here's a link to an example.This also might affect other followup elements as to whether they need to be floats or not.  However, it might also have the desired effect.Alternative solution:http://jsfiddle.net/9EY4R/Note: Having made this suggestion I have to immediately retract it as not generally a good idea, but in some limited situations may appropriate;The panel with items is called order-details with this cssIn the above fiddle - the yellow panel has a margin-top, but unless it is greater than the tallest floated item then it won't do anything (of course that's the whole point of this question).If you set the margin-top of the yellow panel to 20em then it will be visible because the margin is calculated from the top of the outer blue box.Use 'padding-top' in your main data div instead. Or, alternatively, wrap the main data div in one with 'padding-top'.Try setting a bottom margin on one of the floated elements. Alternatively, you can wrap the floats in a parent element, and use a css hack to clear it without additional markup.Sometimes a combination of position relative and margin can solve these type of problems.I use this technique for my alignright and alignleft classes in WordPress.For instance if I want a "bottom margin" that is respected by clearing elements you can use.For your example you could do something like

Z-index only affects positioned elements.

I just added this in firebug and it fixed:I would avoid using a negative z-index. Simply change z-index of #page to 0.As jlego already said a relative position should fix it.

By the way I would suggest ensuring that there is no shadow left or right of the #primaryNav. Since #primaryNav has a width of 100% a shadow on the side makes a horizontal scrollbar appear.For fixing this you could set a overflow:hidden to #iframeI took a look at your site and I think the border-bottom property of #primaryNav is covering up your shadow.

Demo http://jsfiddle.net/ilpo/fzndodgx/5/The simplest way to fix this issue would be by setting the value for the background-origin property as border-box .The following are the relevant background properties that determine the way the background gradient is displayed for this case:Now combining all three we can see that the border must be repeated as much as possible for it to be present even under the borders and that it's starting position is after the border of the box. This implies that the background must be repeated in a cyclic manner so as to fill up the area under the border on the left side. Because of this the left border has the color as the right end of the gradient and vice-versa.By changing it to border-box, we are making the background get positioned with respect to the border box.  This setting also has an effect on the size of the background image and the reason for it is described below in detail.Setting box-sizing as border-box does not bring about any change because that property affects only the size of the box. It has absolutely no effect on the following:As per W3C spec, the below is how the image's dimensions are calculated when no explicit size is provided (default value is auto).Note how it talks about the size of the image and not that of the box. In essence, irrespective of the size of the box, the size of the background image would be calculated based on the definition for keyword contain when the image itself has no intrinsic height (which CSS gradients don't have unlike images). The definition for contain is as follows: Background positioning area is defined as follows (under background-origin property definition):Thus, when the image has no intrinsic height (and in this case no background-size also), the size of the image would be equal to that of background-origin's value (which in our case is padding-box). This is why even setting the box-sizing as border-box has no effect.Note: emphasis within the quoted texts are all mineIf you explicitly set the background-size as the size of the box, you would notice how the issue is resolved on the right side but not on the left side. This is because now the image is large enough to not repeat under the right border but its starting point is still after the left border.The background is repeating itself under the border. The background runs only in the "body" of the element, under the border is an expansion and repeat starts occurring.See this example with no-repeat on the border.UPDATEPlaying with background position & size can help by expanding the background and then adjusting it's location.Check this fiddle out.Or see snippet:The gradient starts within the padding box according to the default CSS box model behaviour, so it makes sense that the very start and very end colours appear until infinity either side of the gradient, where the border would be.The same is true of this gradient (NSFW):It continues infinitely in the starting value (violet) to the left, and continues infinitely with the end value (orange) to the right. It can continue infinitely upwards with this gradient, and so it does.That's my understanding of why this is appearing so, a solution would to use a different box model.The default value of background-origin property is padding-box which means the background is positioned and sized relative to the padding box.The background also extends below border since the background-clip property defaults to border-box; it simply repeats itself below the border. This is why you see the right side of background below left border and vice versa.So, just change the origin:Alternately you can play with background size and position: add 20px to the background size and position it at -10px -10px:Other answers have already shown how to fix the issue, but I thought I should just point out that if you increase the border-width it becomes apparent that the background is actually repeating.will produceIf you don't want to use box-shadow, you could use border-image and adjust the colors of the gradient: http://jsfiddle.net/9pcuj8bw/5/Careful this works not on IE10 or lower: http://caniuse.com/#feat=border-image

I'm using the text-decoration: line-through in CSS, but I can't seem to find any way to vary the line thickness without inelegant hacks like <hr> or image overlays.Is there any elegant way to specify the thickness of a line-through?Here's a pure CSS method that doesn't require any unnecessary wrapper elements. As an added bonus, not only can you adjust the thickness of the strikeout, but you can control its color separately from the text color:Use RGBa colors to make the strikeout semi-transparent:Or even make the strikeout a gradient! Just use a background combined with a height, in place of a border:This works in IE9 (sans gradient) and up – or even IE8 if you use the single-colon :after syntax and manually write the negative margin-top value instead of using calc().The main downside is that this only works on a single line of text. But hey, you take what you can get ;-)This seems to be a longstanding question without an ideal solution for multi-line strikethroughs.Conveniently, using CSS gradients, you can easily adjust your line thickness like so:See the demo and full vendor prefixing here: http://codepen.io/pearlchen/pen/dhpxushort answer: no. it depends on the font, it's the same for the thickness of underline—it changes with the thickness of the textI have an idea but it would require adding an additional element for each level of thickness.htmlcssBTW the spaces in the second span are specials - you will have to use alt+0160 or alt+255.

You can use pixels unit too on the negative top when ull try to position it precisely.There is another alternative which involve using first text-decoration and then style <strike> or <del> and see if you can nudge it vertically without moving the text with it.htmlcssBoth are working fine here, but remember to use a transitional doctype cause <strike> has been deprecated.No.However, if the strike-through color is the same as the text color, you can easily get away with using a custom image in the background.If you require different colors, then overlaying the custom strike-through image is the only way to go.I realize this is old, but there is a way to do it using nested span tags:Strikethrough is dependent upon the size of the font, so if you double the outer span it will make the line twice as thick.  Then, you need to reduce the inner one by half.  The vertical-align is  necessary or else the line is too high, making it appear to almost be an overline.In action:  http://jsfiddle.net/moodleboy/deep3qw8/Works in Chrome/FF, but not Safari, IE10 or Opera.  Works on Chrome on Mac, but not Windows.I've found another approach for multiline text:http://output.jsbin.com/weqovenopi/1/This approach assumes repeating an image (1px width and npx height). Also it works independent on the font-size.Only one disadvantage - background renders under the text.The line thickness is determined by the font (family, size, etc.).  There is no provision in CSS for changing this http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-CSS1/#text-decorationThis does not answer the question, but is relevant in that it solves the lack of a unique strike-through using scripting. I am not a purist, but I believe this is a x-browser solution.I couldn't find an appropriate method here so I used

background-image with a linear-gradient and ex CSS length units.Unfortunately this means that using different font faces will render the strikethrough in a slightly different position (if the fonts have different x-heights).

As you can see, the list-items in the first row have same height. But items in the second row have different heights. I want all items to have a uniform height.Is there any way to achieve this without giving fixed-height and only using flexbox?Here is my code The answer is NO.The reason is provided in the flexbox specification:In other words, when there are multiple lines in a row-based flex container, the height of each line (the "cross size") is the minimum height necessary to contain the flex items on the line.Equal height rows, however, are possible in CSS Grid Layout:Otherwise, consider a JavaScript alternative.You can accomplish that now with display: grid:Although the grid itself is not flexbox, it behaves very similar to a flexbox container, and the items inside the grid can be flex.The grid layout is also very handy in the case you want responsive grids. That is, if you want the grid to have a different number of columns per row you can then just change grid-template-columns:and so on...You can mix it with media queries and change according to the size of the page.Sadly there is still no support for container queries / element queries in the browsers (out of the box) to make it work well with changing the number of columns according to the container size, not to the page size (this would be great to use with reusable webcomponents).More information about the grid layout:https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Grid_LayoutSupport of the Grid Layout accross browsers: https://caniuse.com/#feat=css-gridNo, you can't achieve that without setting a fixed height (or using a script).Here are 2 answers of mine, showing how to use a script to achieve something like that:If you know the items you are mapping through, you can accomplish this by doing one row at a time. I know it's a workaround, but it works. For me I had 4 items per row, so I broke it up into two rows of 4 with each row height: 50%, get rid of flex-grow, have <RowOne /> and <RowTwo /> in a <div> with flex-column. This will do the trickThis seems to be working in cases with fixed parent height (tested in Chrome and Firefox):If it's not possible to use grids for some reason, maybe it's the solution.In your case height will be calculated automatically, so you have to provide the height

use this you can do it by fixing the height of "P" tag or fixing the height of "list-item".I have done by fixing the height of "P"and overflow should be hidden.for same height you should chage your css "display" Properties. For more detail see given example.

The CSS2 box model tells us that adjoining vertical margins collapse.I find it quite annoying, being the source of many design bugs. I hope that by understanding the purpose of collapsing margins, I will understand when to use them and how to avoid them when they are not needed.What is the purpose of this feature?The general meaning of "margin" isn't to convey "move this over by 10px" but rather, "there must be 10px of empty space beside this element."I've always found this is easiest to conceptualize with paragraphs.If you just gave paragraphs margin-top: 10px and had no margins on any other elements, a series of paragraphs would be spaced beautifully. But of course, you'd run into trouble when placing another element underneath a paragraph. The two would touch.If margins didn't collapse, you'd hesitate to add margin-bottom: 10px to your previous code, because then any pair of paragraphs would get spaced 20px apart, while paragraphs would separate from other elements by only 10px.So vertical margins collapse. By adding top and bottom margins of 10px you're saying, "I don't care what margin rules any other elements have. I demand at least 10px of padding above and below each of my paragraphs."

https://stackoverflow.com/a/48004111/2575724Fileformat.info is a pretty good reference for this stuff. In your case, it's already in hex, so the hex value is f066. So you'd do:The code points used in icon font tricks are usually Private Use code points, which means that they have no generally defined meaning and should not be used in open information interchange, only by private agreement between interested parties. However, Private Use code points can be represented as any other Unicode value, e.g. in CSS using a notation like \f066, as others have answered. You can even enter the code point as such, if your document is UTF-8 encoded and you know how to type an arbitrary Unicode value by its number in your authoring environment (but of course it would normally be displayed using a symbol for an unknown character).However, this is not the normal way of using icon fonts. Normally you use a CSS file provided with the font and use constructs like <span class="icon-resize-small">foo</span>. The CSS code will then take care of inserting the symbol at the start of the element, and you don’t need to know the code point number.At first link fontwaesome CSS file in your HTML file then create an after or before pseudo class like "font-family: "FontAwesome";

    content: "\f101";" then save. I hope this work good.

Bootstrap Spacing includes a wide range of shorthand responsive margin and padding. In below example mr-1 set the margin or padding to $spacer * .25.Example:You can read more at Bootstrap Spacing.This will provide permanent spacing.If you want use margin, remove the class on every button and use :last-child CSS selector.Html :Css :Depends on how much space you want. I'm not sure I agree with the logic of adding a "col-XX-1" in between each one, because you are then defining an entire "column" in between each one.If you just want "a little spacing" in between each button, I like to add padding to the encompassing row. That way, I can still use all 12 columns, while including a "space" in between each button.Bootply: http://www.bootply.com/ugeXrxpPvDUse btn-primary-spacing class for all buttons remove margin-left classExample : CSS will be like :You can use built-in spacing from Bootstrap so no need for additional CSS there. This is for Bootstrap 4. Adding margins to a button makes it wider so that les buttons fit in the grid system. If only a visual effect is important, then give the button a white border with [style="margin:0px; border:solid white;"] This leaves the button width unaffected.The original code is mostly there, but you need btn-groups around each button.  In Bootstrap 3 you can use a btn-toolbar and a btn-group to get the job done; I haven't done BS4 but it has similar constructs.using bootstrap you can add  <div class="col-sm-1 col-xs-1 col-md-1 col-lg-1"></div> between buttons.

Here is what I have so far (also available as a jsFiddle)As long as the flex container has no height itself, you can set height: 0% on the first flex item. Because it has no height to inherit from its parent, any percentage height will cause it to collapse. It will then grow with its contents.In this example I have removed the -webkit prefix. It's only really required for Safari and the prefix can be added above the non-prefixed version. I also removed flex-direction: row as it is the default value.I know this is an old question but a better solution is to set the flex item to align to the top using flex-start.Setting the height of the children to max-content will prevent them to shrink.

To fix this, add this to your css:Another option is to put all of the fields that you want on a single line within a single form-group.

Only thing is that the labels are a little too high so I added padding-top:5px to center them with my inputs.To make it work in Chrome (and bootply) i had to change code in this way:I had problems aligning the label to the input(s) elements so I transferred the label element inside the form-inline and form-group too...and it works..

I would like to have the map div on the right, and on the left (next to the map) the list placed on top and the second div below the list(but still on the right to the map)Any ideas?I think what you want requires an extra wrapper div.use clear:left; or clear:both in your css.Float the #list and #similar the right and add clear: right; to #similarLike so:You might need a wrapper(div) around all of them though that's the same width of the left and right element.what u can also do i place an extra "dummy" div before your last div.Make it 1 px heigh and the width as much needed to cover the container div/bodyThis will make the last div appear under it, starting from the left.

CSS Animation and Display None

[CSS Animation and Display None](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/13037637/css-animation-and-display-none)

I have a CSS Animation for a div that slides in after a set amount of time. What I would like is for a few divs to fill the space of the animated div that slides in, which it will then push those elements down the page. When I attempt this at first div that slides in still takes up space even when it is not visible. If I change the div to display:none the div doesn't slide in at all. How do I have a div not take up space until it is timed to come in (using CSS for the timing.)I am using Animate.css for the animations.Here is what the code looks like: As the code shows I would like the main div to be hidden and the other divs show at first.

EDITI have attempted what Duopixel suggested but either I mis-understood and am not doing this correctly or it doesn't work. Here is the code: HTML CSSCSS (or jQuery, for that matter) can't animate between display: none; and display: block;. Worse yet: it can't animate between height: 0 and height: auto. So you need to hard code the height (if you can't hard code the values then you need to use javascript, but this is an entirely different question);You mention that you're using Animate.css, which I'm not familiar with, so this is a vanilla CSS.You can see a demo here: http://jsfiddle.net/duopixel/qD5XX/There are a few answers already, but here is my solution:I use opacity: 0 and visibility: hidden. To make sure that visibility is set before the animation, we have to set the right delays.I use http://lesshat.com to simplify the demo, for use without this just add the browser prefixes.(e.g. -webkit-transition-duration: 0, 200ms;)So as soon as you add the class hidden to your element, it will fade out.I had the same problem, because as soon as display: x; is in animation, it won't animate.I ended up in creating custom keyframes, first changing the display value then the other values. May give a better solution.Or, instead of using display: none; use position: absolute; visibility: hidden; It should work.You can manage to have a pure CSS implementation with max-heightYou might have to also set padding, margin and border to 0, or simply padding-top, padding-bottom, margin-top and margin-bottom.I updated the demo of Duopixel here : http://jsfiddle.net/qD5XX/231/The following will get you to animate an element whenCSSJavaScriptWhen animating height (from 0 to auto), using transform: scaleY(0); is another useful approach to hide the element, instead of display: none;:Here is my solution to the same problem.Moreover I have an onclick on the last frame loading another slideshow, and it must not be clickable until the last frame is visible.Basically my solution is to keep the div 1 pixel high using a scale(0.001), zooming it when I need it. If you don't like the zoom effect you can restore the opacity to 1 after zooming the slide.Other keyframes are removed for the sake of bytes. Please disregard the odd coding, it is made by a php script picking values from an array and str_replacing a template: I'm too lazy to retype everything for every proprietary prefix on a 100+ divs slideshow.

Prevent flex items from stretching

2015-11-24 06:41:48Z

Sample:

I have two questions, please:You don't want to stretch the span in height?

You have the possiblity to affect one or more flex-items to don't stretch the full height of the container.To affect all flex-items of the container, choose this:

You have to set align-items: flex-start; to div and all flex-items of this container get the height of their content.To affect only a single flex-item, choose this:

If you want to unstretch a single flex-item on the container, you have to set align-self: flex-start; to this flex-item. All other flex-items of the container aren't affected.Why is this happening to the span?

The default value of the property align-items is stretch. This is the reason why the span fill the height of the div.Difference between baseline and flex-start?

If you have some text on the flex-items, with different font-sizes, you can use the baseline of the first line to place the flex-item vertically. A flex-item with a smaller font-size have some space between the container and itself at top. With flex-start the flex-item will be set to the top of the container (without space).

How to debug CSS/Javascript hover issues

[How to debug CSS/Javascript hover issues](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1080803/how-to-debug-css-javascript-hover-issues)

I often find myself wanting to debug CSS layout issues that involve DOM changes caused by Javascript in reaction to a hover event or different CSS rules applying due to the :hover selector.Normally, I'd use Firebug to inspect the element that's giving me trouble and see what its CSS properties were, and where those properties come from. However, when hovering is involved, it becomes impossible, because as soon as you move your mouse down to the Firebug panel, the elements you're interested in are no longer hovered, the CSS rules that apply are different, and (in the case of JS hovers) the DOM is changed.Is there any way I can "freeze" the state of the DOM and application of :hover in order to inspect the DOM as it was during a hover event?Any other ideas on how to debug this sort of issue are welcome, of course.

However, when hovering is involved, it becomes impossible, because as soon as you move your mouse down to the Firebug panel, the elements you're interested in are no longer hovered, the CSS rules that apply are different, and (in the case of JS hovers) the DOM is changed.Is there any way I can "freeze" the state of the DOM and application of :hover in order to inspect the DOM as it was during a hover event?Any other ideas on how to debug this sort of issue are welcome, of course.Add an onmouseover function handler to the element that is taking the :hover.  Inside that function, call console.info(element) on whichever element you'd like to know about.When you run this with firebug active, the element will be available to inspect in the firebug console.You can do this in Firebug but its a little "buggy". If you inspect the element and then click off the the html tab, to the DOM tab for instance, when you go back to the html tab the "style" css tab on the right will have an arrow drop down selector where you can select the :hover state of that element to be active. Sucks to have to switch tabs to get it to show but it works for me.When inspecting links, Firebug shows the default CSS state, i.e. styles applied to a:link. By default, the :hover and :active styles are not shown. Fortunately, you can change the state of the link by clicking Style and choosing the appropriate option:In firebug, while in the HTML view, look to the right-side panel and find the "Styles" tab. Click the down arrow and select :hover.In Firefox (v33.1.1):Some JavaScript toolkits, such as Dojo use CSS classes such as dijitButtonHover to style rather than :hover.So the Style tab :hover trick doesn't work.Instead, you can right-click the Node (who's CSS classes change) in the HTML tab, and "Break on Attribute Change"In Chrome (version 35):for css issues, i find web developer plugin invaluable:http://chrispederick.com/work/web-developer/load it, then you have 2 possible tools at your disposal.the latter would also return all classes applied to the element.of course it has other great uses such as, superb debugging of forms, including of editing of hidden fields and cookies (which can be used for penetration testing)You can also inspect that element, then on the style the tab there should be a little drop down arrow. It will have something like "Show User Agent", "Expand Shorthand Properties", then there should be 2 more under that (I'm guessing that you are inspecting something that has a hover state) :active and :hover select the :hover and you should be golden.I had the same problem and found that whilst I couldn't inspect hover objects in Firefox with Firebug, Safari's Web Inspector would freeze the current state and allow inspection.  To activate Safari's web inspector just enter the following line into the terminal and restart Safari:Activate the hover element in the browser, then right click and select 'Inspect Element'. The page will freeze in it's current state allowing you to inspect the fleeting objects to your heart's content. There is no perfect solution (mouseover/hover-simulation effect) in firebug.However, there are a couple ways to edit your hover state in firebug:I often make some alternate CSS or Javascript to "freeze" my hovered event; tweak it to perfection with Firebug and put my hover back in place.Yes, you can right-click "Inspect element" when triggering the hover state. This worked for me in Firebug and WebKit.I know this post is a bit old, but for those who find this on Google, I created a cross browser tool that allows you to visualize your HTML / CSS layout just by moving the mouse.  You can easily view elements in their hover state.HTML Box Visualizer - GitHubIn newer Firefox versions (at least v57 and above), the inspector's UI is slightly different than when the other answers were posted. To enable and freeze the :active/:hover/:focus state of an element, inspect it (right click -> Inspect element) and in the inspector click on:Result:Source (images are licensed under CC-BY-SA v2.5, The Mozilla Contributors)

Because css on its own will not be enough to produce the effect you need.You can play with the left and top css attributes to show the error message on top, left, right or bottom of the element.

For example to show the error on the top:And so on. You can refer to jQuery documentation about css for more options.Here is the css I used. The result looks exactly like the one you want. With as little CSS as possible:And here is the background image you need:

(source: scriptiny.com)  If you want the error message to be displayed after a group of options or fields. Then group all those elements inside one container a 'div' or a 'fieldset'. Add a special class to all of them 'group' for example. And add the following to the begining of the errorPlacement function:If you only want to handle specific cases you can use attr instead:That should be enough for the error message to be displayed next to the parent element.You may need to change the width of the parent element to be less than 100%.I've tried your code and it is working perfectly fine for me. Here is a preview:

I just made a very small adjustment to the message padding to make it fit in the line:You can change those numbers to increase/decrease the padding on top/bottom or left/right. You can also add a height and width to the error message. If you are still having issues, try to replace the span with a div And then give the container a width (this is very important)About the blank page. As I said I tried your code and it is working for me. It might be something else in your code that is causing the issue.I use jQuery BeautyTips to achieve the little bubble effect you are talking about. I don't use the Validation plugin so I can't really help much there, but it is very easy to style and show the BeautyTips. You should look into it. It's not as simple as just CSS rules, I'm afraid, as you need to use the canvas element and include an extra javascript file for IE to play nice with it.A few things:First, I don't think you really need a validation error for a radio fieldset because you could just have one of the fields checked by default. Most people would rather correct something then provide something. For instance:is more likely to be changed to the right answer as the person DOESN'T want it to go to the default. If they see it blank, they are more likely to think "none of your business" and skip it.Second, I was able to get the effect I think you are wanting without any positioning properties. You just add padding-right to the form (or the div of the form, whatever) to provide enough room for your error and make sure your error will fit in that area. Then, you have a pre-set up css class called "error" and you set it as having a negative margin-top roughly the height of your input field and a margin-left about the distance from the left to where your padding-right should start. I tried this out, it's not great, but it works with three properties and requires no floats or absolutes:Unfortunately I can't comment with my newbie reputation, but I have a solution for the issue of the screen going blank, or at least this is what worked for me. Instead of setting the wrapper class inside of the errorPlacement function, set it immediately when you're setting the wrapper type. });I'm assuming doing it this way allows the validator to know which div elements to remove, instead of all of them. Worked for me but I'm not entirely sure why, so if someone could elaborate that might help others out a ton.That answer really helped me, in my case i had to filter some elements out and have special aligment on their error div,Add following css to your .validate method to change the css or functionality        If you could provide some reason as to why you need to replace the label with a div, that would certainly help...Also, could you paste a sample that'd be helpful ( http://dpaste.com/ or http://pastebin.com/)

This is what I started but it just has a straight line:I'm not sure it's your shape but it's close - you can play with the values:https://jsfiddle.net/7fjSc/9/I think this is the right way to make a shape like you want. By using the SVG possibilities, and an container to keep the shape responsive.My implementation uses the svg element in html and I also made a generator for making the wave you want:https://smooth.ie/blogs/news/svg-wavey-transitions-between-sectionshttps://jsfiddle.net/1b8L7nax/5/My pure CSS implementation based on above with 100% width. Hope it helps!I like ThomasA's answer, but wanted a more realistic context with the wave being used to separate two divs. So I created a more complete demo where the separator SVG gets positioned perfectly between the two divs.Now I thought it would be cool to take it further. What if we could do this all in CSS without the need for the inline SVG? The point being to avoid extra markup. Here's how I did it:Two simple <div>:Demo Wavy divider (with CSS pseudo-elements to avoid extra markup)It was a bit trickier to position than with an inline SVG but works just as well. (Could use CSS custom properties or pre-processor variables to keep the height and padding easy to read.)To edit the colors, you need to edit the URL-encoded SVG itself.Pay attention (like in the first demo) to a change in the viewBox to get rid of unwanted spaces in the SVG. (Another option would be to draw a different SVG.)Another thing to pay attention to here is the background-size set to 100% 100% to get it to stretch in both directions.Recently an awesome tool called Get Waves was introduced where you can simply from UI create your own waves and then export this to SVG format. This is as simple as going to the https://getwaves.io/ website and enjoying it!Here's another way to do it :)  The concept is to create a clip-path polygon with the wave as one side.  This approach is fairly flexible.  You can change the position (left, right, top or bottom) in which the wave appears, change the wave function to any function(t) which maps to [0,1]).  The polygon can also be used for shape-outside, which lets text flow around the wave when in 'left' or 'right' orientation.At the end, an example you can uncomment which demonstrates animating the wave.

You can use the border-radius to get the round effect, as shown by Rikudo Sennin and RoToRa!If you wish to have a progress bar without adding some code PACE can be an awesome tool for you.Just include pace.js and a CSS theme of your choice, and you get a beautiful progress indicator for your page load and AJAX navigation.

Is it possible to have a placeholder on a select tag?or may be a possible work around?

2013-07-11 20:38:45Z

Is it possible to have a placeholder on a select tag?or may be a possible work around?EDIT: This did/does work at the time I wrote it, but as Blexen pointed out, it's not in the spec. Add an option like so: The correct way:According to Mozilla Dev Network, placeholder is not a valid attribute on a <select> input.Instead, add an option with an empty value and the selected attribute, as shown below. The empty value attribute is mandatory to prevent the default behaviour which is to use the contents of the <option> as the <option>'s value.In modern browsers, adding the required attribute to the <select> element will not allow the user to submit the form which the element is part of if the selected option has an empty value.If you want to style the default option inside the list (which appears when clicking the element), there's a limited number of CSS properties that are well-supported. color and background-color are the 2 safest bets, other CSS properties are likely to be ignored.In my option the best way (in HTML5) to mark the default option is using the custom data-* attributes.1 Here's how to style the default option to be greyed out:However, this will only style the item inside the drop-down list, not the value displayed on the input. If you want to style that with CSS, target your <select> element directly. In that case, you can only change the style of the currently selected element at any time.2If you wanted to make it slightly harder for the user to select the default item, you could set the display: none; CSS rule on the <option>, but remember that this will not prevent users from selecting it (using e.g. arrow keys/typing), this just makes it harder for them to do so.1 This answer previously advised the use of a default attribute which is non-standard and has no meaning on its own.

2 It's technically possible to style the select itself based on the selected value using JavaScript, but that's outside the scope of this question. This answer, however, covers this method.

With inline styles you are targeting the element directly. You can't use other selectors there.What you can do however is define different classes in your stylesheet that define different colours and then add the class to the element.The key is to use background-color: inherit; on the pseudo element. See: http://jsfiddle.net/EdUmc/You can, using CSS variables (more precisely called CSS custom properties).Browser compatibilityIf you really need it inline, for example because you are loading some user-defined colors dynamically, you can always add a <style> element right before your content.Example use case with PHP and some (wordpress inspired) dummy functions:Since HTML 5.2 it is valid to place style elements inside the body, although it is still recommend to place style elements in the head.Reference: https://www.w3.org/TR/html52/document-metadata.html#the-style-elementI resolved a similar problem by border-color: inherit, see:

I got a table-cell with fixed width and height and if text is too large, cell size should remain the same and text should be hidden by overflow:hidden.Table-cell, however, expands beyond 100px if too much text is added. Any tricks to prevent it from expanding?Text should be several lines in length, so "white-space:nowrap" solution is not applicableBy CSS 2.1 rules, the height of a table cell is「the minimum height required by the content」. Thus, you need to restrict the height indirectly using inner markup, normally a div element (<td><div>content</div></td>), and set height and overflow properties on the the div element (without setting display: table-cell on it, of course, as that would make its height obey CSS 2.1 table cell rules).I don't think that the accepted answer actually fully solves the problem. You wanted to have a vertical-align: middle on the table-cells content. But when you add a div inside the table-cell and give it a height the content of that inner DIV will be at the top. 

Check this jsfiddle. The overflow:hidden; works fine, but if you shorten the content so that it's only one line, this line won't be centered verticallyThe solution is not to add a DIV inside the table-cell but rather outside. Here's the Code:You can do either of the following:good luck!Try something like this:-In css you can't set table-cells max height, and if you white-space nowrap then you can't break it with max width, so the solution is javascript working in all browsers.So, this can work for you.For Limiting max-height of all cells or rows in table with Javascript:This script is good for horizontal overflow tables.This script increase the table width 300px each time, maximum 4000px until rows shrinks to max-height(160px) ,  and you can also edit numbers as your need.Source: HTML Table Solution Max Height Limit For Rows Or Cells By Increasing Table Width, JavascriptUse the style below:With the HTML being:if you are using display:table-cell, max-height will not work for div of this style.

so the solution which worked for me is to set the max height of inner div TryMight this fit your needs?This is what you want:

CSS keyframe animation CPU usage is high, should it be this way?

I use following keyframe animation on several elements:On my computer I am getting around 40% CPU usage both in Chrome and Firefox. 

Is it the current state of animations (nice but not usable for now) or am I missing some magic property?You can check the following sample with the same animation:

http://jsfiddle.net/Nrp6Q/Yes, this is normal because you have several infinite-loop animations on the page. The CPU is therefore continually doing work while these elements are rendered. There is a "magic" property that will significantly cut-down the CPU usage and that is:This will composite the elements into their own layers (by tricking the browser into thinking it will be doing 3D transforms) and the browser should, in most cases, take advantage of GPU acceleration, lessening the burden on the CPU. For me this cut it down by about 20% (almost half).To read more about this technique take a look at: http://ariya.blogspot.com/2011/07/fluid-animation-with-accelerated.htmlAdditionally, the more keyframes you have in the animation, the more taxing it will be as well. Just try the animation with the middle keyframe cut out and you will see another substantial (~10-12%) drop in CPU usage.Lastly, not all properties are equal -- box-shadow is much harder for the browser to animate smoothly than, say, background-color. Leaving all of the keyframes intact but dropping the box-shadow property, using the translateZ(0) trick had my CPU usage hovered at only 10-11%.As much as it pains me to say this, for infinite-loop animations an animated .gif is going to perform much, much better than CSS3 in the current state of browser animation, especially if you plan for many of them to remain rendered on the page for some time.Update 2017:For those still finding their way to this question and answer, translate3d(0, 0, 0) provides the same benefit as translateZ(0), you're just also setting translateX() and translateY() at the same time. Please ignore the comment by @Farside as he uses translate3d(X, Y, Z) in his demo but does not compare it to translate(X, Y), which would show that using this technique still makes a significant difference.According to this question, some people have found better performance across all browsers, especially Chrome, with transform: rotateZ(360deg).One of the possible ways to reduce the load on CPU, is to use a so called null transform hack, which is often hailed as something of a silver bullet. In many cases it will drastically improve rendering performance in WebKit and Blink browsers like Chrome, Opera and Safari.The null transform hack basically does two things:To "force" a browser, simply add one of these CSS properties to the element:When working with 3D transforms, it's good to have these properties as well to improve the performance:Enabling a hardware acceleration in CSS3 for a lot of objects may slow down performance!

Apparently, each null 3D transform creates a new layer. However, force-hacking layer creation may not always be the solution to certain performance bottlenecks on a page. Layer creation techniques can boost page speed, but they come with a cost: they take up memory in system RAM and on the GPU. So even if the GPU does a good job, the transfer of many objects might be a problem so that using GPU acceleration might not be worth it. The cite from W3C:Moving a few big objects has a higher performance, than moving lots of small items when using 3D-acceleration. So they must be used wisely and you need to make sure that hardware-accelerating your operation will really help the performance of your page, and that a performance bottleneck is not being caused by another operation on your page.Moreover, a GPU is designed specifically for performing the complex mathematical/geometric calculations, and offloading operations onto the GPU can yield massive power consumption. Obviously, when hardware kicks in, so does the battery of the target device. The progress is not standing on the one place... W3C introduced the will-change CSS property. To cut the long story short, the will-change property allows you to inform the browser ahead of time of what kinds of changes you are likely to make to an element, so that it can set up the appropriate optimizations before they're needed.Here's what they say in the the draft:Using will-change, hinting to the browser about an upcoming transformation can be as simple as adding this rule to the element that you’re expecting to be transformed:When developing for mobile, developers are forced to take the wide array of device constraints into consideration while writing mobile web apps. Browsers are becoming smarter, and sometimes, it's better to leave the decision to the platform itself, instead of overlapping acceleration and forcing the behavior in a hacky-way.I had a similar case of high CPU usage when animating some elements with CSS3. I was animating the "left"-property of ~7 elements, with some opacity- and shadow-properties used in my whole page. I decided to switch to jQuery.animate, which sadly didn't improve the performance at all. My CPU (i7) was still at ~9-15% while displaying the page, several tricks (translateZ, etc) didn't really improve the performance either - while having my layout messed up (some absolute-positioned elements were involved, ouch!).Then I stumbled upon this wonderful extension: http://playground.benbarnett.net/jquery-animate-enhanced/I simply referenced the .js-file, didn't make a single change at the jQuery transitions, and my CPU usage is now 1-2% on the very same page.My recommendation: when facing CPU issues using CSS3 transitions, switch to jQuery + the animate-enhanced-plugin.You can also use this on any of the following class elements where you want to use GPU instead of CPUTo a particular case of 'pulsing' background animation, reported here, I've come up with a css+js solution.In my case the background animation was on background-position property rather than on the background-color, but the principle is the same.Ok, let's say you have a block with a particular background:Let's style it: (scss)Now it's time to make the effect happen by adding a class 'animated' to the block with some JavaScript:This improved performace in my case by ~15 times.(i) Note to calculate seconds for transition and timeouts correctly both in css and js if you want values different from 5 seconds.

Is there some kind of "not" CSS selector?For example when I write the following line in my CSS, all input fields inside an tag with class classname will have a red background.How do I select all input fields that are OUTSIDE of a tag with class classname?

With current browser CSS support, you can't.Newer browsers now support it- see Sam's answer for more info.(See other answers for the alternatives in CSS.)

If doing it in JavaScript/jQuery is acceptable, you can do:Mozilla supports negation pseudo-class:See also: http://developer.mozilla.org/en/Mozilla_CSS_support_chartNote that the negation pseudo class is in the Selectors Level 3 Recommendation and works in recent versions of Firefox, Chrome and Safari (at least). Sample code below.Wouldn't you do that by setting the 'global' background to red, then using the classname to alter the others?I would do thisThere is no way to select the parent of matched elements with CSS. You would have to use JavaScript to select them.From your question I assume you have markup that looks more or less like this:One option is to add a class to a higher element, say the <form>, and write a rule to style all of the inputs of the form. I.E:OrIf you want to select them based on the fact that they are not inside of an element with a specific class, you're out of luck without the use of JavaScript.I think the closest you can get is to only affect direct descendants with a declarationThis code for example will only affect input fields directly under divs with class "maincontent"Inputs are a bit annoying because, unlike most other html elements, there isn't necessarily a way of resetting all the css properties back to their default value.If the styling is non-critical (ie a nice to have but doesn't affect functionality) I would use jQuery to get an array of all the inputs, check their parents, and then only carry out the styling on those outside that div. Something like:(By the way, I'm no jQuery expert, so there might be some errors in the above, but in principle something like this should work)

Since this rule appears later in the source order, it overrides any previous or external declarations.I'd argue this isn't exactly the most robust or elegant approach, but it illustrates the most basic example.Another solution I ran across tonight, which worked for my needs, was to add box-sizing attributes:These attributes force the border to be part of the box model's width and height and correct the issue as well.According to caniuse.com » box-sizing, box-sizing is supported in IE8+.If you're using LESS or Sass there is a Bootstrap mixin for this.LESS:Sass:

VictorI like to use "django-crispy-forms" which is the successor to django-uni-form.  It's a great little API and has great support for Bootstrap.I tend to use the template filters for quickly porting old code and quick forms, and the template tags when I need more control over the rendering.This is what I came up with:When django-crispy-forms cannot be used (e.g. when the template treats individually each field of the form), jcmrgo's answer is the only way to go. Based on his answer, here is a solution for Bootstrap 3 (leaving his version for Boostrap 2), and with adjustment of field classes inside the template. While field classes are not reachable from within the template with Django's standard library (which leads to that extra forms or template tags in other solutions), here is a solution that sets the right classes to field tags without having to code outside the template:This needs django-widget-tweaks installed and widget_tweaks added to INSTALLED_APPS.You could do something like this:In order to add CSS attributes to Django generated forms it's enough to use the following code in your forms.py:It will produce the following HTML code:I definitely recommend https://github.com/dyve/django-bootstrap-toolkitFor Example, you could created a class which defines the attributes the way you want and just call it accordingly.Bootstrap styles forms with <div>s rather than <p>s. So, if you want it to look nice, you need to go bootstrap way 100% IMHO. And here is my preferred way of doing it:Use django-bootstrap3 app. Example:Notice the horizontal in 1) form class attribute 2) bootstrap_form layout and 3) buttons layout.Here is my version using django_tweaks with a better looking result. I find render_field lighter to use than adding filters. I have also added bootstrap formatted alert messages and turned off navigator validation (with novalidate). I am relatively new to Django so don't hesitate to comment if you find any non-senseThe fastest and easiest way would be to define your own base class that extends the Django Form class, and redefine its as_p method to output in the format Bootstrap requires. Then change your forms to inherit from your new Form class instead of Django's.besides what other friends said, I would recommend using 'django-widget-tweaks'.the answer would be sth like this:

See word-wrap in IE.How do you solve this problem?I haven't personally used it, but Hyphenator looks promising.Also see related (possibly duplicate) questions:in CSS3: I was trying to solve the same problem and I found de solution here:http://perishablepress.com/press/2010/06/01/wrapping-content/Solution: adding to the container the following CSS propertiesThe idea is using them all so you get better cross-browser compatibilityHope this helpsI like to use the overflow: auto CSS property/value pairing.  This will render the parent object the way you'd expect it to appear.  If the text within the parent is too wide, scrollbars appear within the object itself.  This will keep the structure the way you want it to look and provide the viewer with the ability to scroll over to see more.Edit: the nice thing about overflow: auto compared to overflow: scroll is that with auto, the scrollbars will only appear when overflowing content exists.  With scroll, the scrollbars are always visible.I'm surprised that nobody has mentioned one of my favorite solutions to this problem, the <wbr> (optional line-break) tag. It's fairly well-supported in browsers and essentially tells the browser that it can insert a line-break if it's necessary. There's also the related zero-width space character, &#8203; with the same meaning.For the use case mentioned, displaying user comments on a web page, I would assume that there is already some output formatting to prevent injection attacks, etc. So it's simple to add these <wbr> tags every N characters in words that are too long, or in links.This is especially useful when you need control over the format of the output, which CSS doesn't always let you do.I would put the post in a div that would have a fixed width setting overflow to scroll (or to hide completely depending on the content).so like:But that's just me.EDIT: As cLFlaVA points out... it is better to use auto then scroll.

[Fading out text on overflow with css if the text is bigger than allowed](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/22808040/fading-out-text-on-overflow-with-css-if-the-text-is-bigger-than-allowed)

I am trying to create a text fade-out effect when the amount of text is bigger than the row can handle. I am achieving this with the mixture of max-height, overflow and linear-gradient. Something like this.The full fiddle is available. I am trying to achieve effect similar to this one  and I am kind of close. The problem is that in my case text start to fade-out from the very beginning and I want it to start fading out only if it is really close to maximum size. Lets say start fading out if it is already 150px. Also I am using only -webkit prefix and I assume that there may be other prefixes that I can add for other rendering engines.Is there a way to do this in pure CSS?

So you can try using some kind of transparent linear gradient layer placed on top of the text area, we can achieve this in a neat way using the pseudo-element :before like this:FiddleI’d suggest something like this:Apply the gradient to an absolutely positioned pseudo-element (:after), that get’s positioned at say 160px from top with 40px height – that way, it’ll not be shown at all in shorter boxes (because of their max-height in combination with overflow:hidden). And the gradient itself is from totally transparent (rgba(0,0,0,0)) to solid black.http://jsfiddle.net/b9vtW/2/I think your are looking for something like this, right?http://jsfiddle.net/QPFkH/If you don't need to rely on percentage values, use box-shadow instead of background-image. It makes it possible to let the user interact with the elements behind your fading-thingy, without the need of pointer-events: none (http://caniuse.com/#feat=pointer-events):But be warned, box-shadow can slow down scrolling:I recomend you to use http://www.colorzilla.com/gradient-editor/.What you are looking for may be:and if not workign as you wish, copy and paste those css in the url (css window) and modifie it at will.Your code is correct just the liner gradient percent must be setTry the fiddle linkhttp://jsfiddle.net/ShinyMetilda/kb4fL/1/You could alse specfiy it in pixel like thisBoth works the sameI had a similar problem with a bootstrap button which has a vertical gradient and also change of gradient on hover.

Please help. Thanks in advance.First, There is no such css-changes event out of the box, but you can  create one by your own, as onchange is for :input elements only. not for css changes.There are two ways to track css changes.   First way:Second way:If you control the css changes, the second option is a lot more elegant and efficient way of doing it.Documentations:Please don't use techniques described in other answers here. They are either not working with css3 animations size changes, floating layout changes or changes that don't come from jQuery land. You can use a resize-detector, a event-based approach, that doesn't waste your CPU time.https://github.com/marcj/css-element-queriesIt contains a ResizeSensor class you can use for that purpose.Disclaimer: I wrote this libraryFor future sake I'll post this.

It still loads the content but the content is hidden and you have a blank Fancybox. *cry*The solution is very simple, but took me about 2 hours and half the hair on my head to find it.Simply wrap your content with a (redundant) div that has display: none and Bob is your uncle.VoilaThe way I figured this out was going through the example index.html/style.css that comes packaged with the Fancybox installation. If you view the code that is used for the demo website and basically copy/paste, you'll be fine.To get an inline Fancybox working, you will need to have this code present in your index.html file:Remember to be precise about what folders your script files are placed in and where you are pointing to in the Head tag; they must correspond.Just something I found for Wordpress users,As obvious as it sounds, If your div is returning some AJAX content based on say a header that would commonly link out to a new post page, some tutorials will say to return false since you're returning the post data on the same page and the return would prevent the page from moving. However if you return false, you also prevent Fancybox2 from doing it's thing as well. I spent hours trying to figure that stupid simple thing out. So for these kind of links, just make sure that the href property is the hashed (#) div you wish to select, and in your javascript, make sure that you do not return false since you no longer will need to.Simple I know ^_^

Why should I use a container div in HTML?

[Why should I use a container div in HTML?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/354739/why-should-i-use-a-container-div-in-html)

I have noticed a common technique is to place a generic container div in the root of the body tag:Is there a valid reason for doing this? Why can't the css just reference the body tag?

2008-12-10 00:34:27Z

I have noticed a common technique is to place a generic container div in the root of the body tag:Is there a valid reason for doing this? Why can't the css just reference the body tag?The container div, and sometimes content div, are almost always used to allow for more sophisticated CSS styling.  The body tag is special in some ways.  Browsers don't treat it like a normal div; its position and dimensions are tied to the browser window.But a container div is just a div and you can style it with margins and borders.  You can give it a fixed width, and you can center it with margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto.Plus, content, like a copyright notice for example, can go on the outside of the container div, but it can't go on the outside of the body, allowing for content on the outside of a border.THis method allows you to have more flexibility of styling your entire content.  Effectivly creating two containers that you can style.  THe HTML Body tag which serves as your background, and the div with an id of container which contains your content.This then allows you to position your content within the page, while styling a background or other effects without issue.  THink of it as a "Frame" for the content.The most common reasons for me are so that:Certain browsers (<cough> Internet Explorer) don't support certain properties on the body, notably width and max-width.I know this is an old question, but i faced this issue myself redesigning a website.

Troy Dalmasso got me thinking. He makes a good point. So, i started to see if i could get it working without a container div.I could when i set the width of the body. In my case to 960px.This is the css i use:This nicely centers the inline-blocks which also have a fixed width.Hope this is of use to anyone.This is one of the biggest bad habits perpetrated by front end coders.All the answers above me are wrong. The body does take a width, margins, borders, etc and should act as your initial container. The html element should act as your background "canvas" as it was intended. In dozens of sites I've done I've only had to use a container div once.I'd be willing to be that these same coders using container divs are also littering their markup with divs inside of divs--everywhere else.Dont' do it. Use divs sparingly and aim for lean markup.-=-=-

UPDATE - Not sure what's wrong with SO because I can edit this answer from 5 years ago but I can't reply to the comments as it says I need 50 Rep before I can do so. Accordingly, I'll add my answer to the replies it received here.

-=-=-I just found this, years after my answer, and see that there are some follow up replies. And, surely you jest?The installed placeholder site you found for my domain, which I never claimed was my markup or styling, or even mentioned in my post, was very clearly a basic CMS install with not one word of content (it said as much on the homepage). That was not my markup and styling. That was the Silverstripe default template. And I take no credit for it. It is, though, perhaps one of only two examples I can think of that would necessitate a container div.Example 1: A generic template designed to accommodate unknowns. In this case you were seeing a default CMS template that had divs inside of divs inside of divs.The horror.Example 2: A three column layout to get the footer to clear properly (I think this was probably the scenario I had that needed a container div, hard to remember because that was years ago.)I did just build (not even finished yet) a theme for my domain and started loading content. For this easily achieved example of semantic markup, click the link.http://www.bitbeyond.comFrankly, I'm baffled that people think you actually need a container div and start with one before ever even trying just a body. The body, as I heard it explained once by one of the original authors of the CSS spec, was intended as the "initial container".Markup should be added as needed, not because thats just the way you've seen it done.div tags are used to style the webpage so that it look visually appealing for the users or audience of the website. using container-div in html will make the website look more professional and attractive and therefore more people will want to explore your page.Well,The container div is very good to have, because if You want the site centered, You just can't do it just with body or html... But You can, with divs. Why container? Its usually used, just because the code itselve has to be clean and readable. So that is container... It contains all website, in case You want to mess with it around :)Good luckMost of the browser are taking web page size by default. So, sometime page will not display same in different browser. So, by using  user can change for specific HTML element. For example, user can add margin, size, width, height etc of specific HTML tag. 

HTML element which defaults to display:inline-block?

<div> defaults to block<span> defaults to inlineIs there one that defaults to inline-block?If not, what special tag name would be appropriate for me to apply 'inline-block' using CSS?

Or should I stick to using a class?From what I can tell the <img> tag is the only inline-block by default. To be on the safe side I would recommend a class, you never know when changing all elements of a certain type will come back to bite you. Or, you could always make up your own tag and assign display:inline-block; to it. This way you aren't changing the default functionality of standard elements...EDITIt also appears that button, textarea, input, and select elements are also inline-blockSources:According to this img is inline-block http://dev.w3.org/html5/markup/img.html#img-displayAnd here claims that button, textarea, etc. are as well: http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/sample.htmlEDIT #2While the source above claims that img tags are inline-block it seems (thanks to Alohci) that they are just inline http://jsfiddle.net/AQ2yp/The following were tested in Firefox:button is inline-block: http://jsfiddle.net/GLS4P/textarea is inline: http://jsfiddle.net/235vc/input is inline: http://jsfiddle.net/RFKe8/select is inline-block: http://jsfiddle.net/5B4Gs/Strictly speaking, no there isn't. The W3 HTML specifications do not ever specify default CSS property values for any elements. They do provide a "default style sheet" for HTML 4, but developers are only encouraged to use it - it is not a requirement or any sort of mandate. The HTML 5 specifications indicate "typical default display properties" but, again, those are not required (also keep in mind that HTML 5 is still a working draft anyways).So that leaves all default values up to the browser and how the developers actually feel elements should be displayed to a user. No one can guarantee that a specific element will display as inline-block or any other way in someone's browser. You should always explicitly set that if you want it to happen. Don't rely on "defaults."This is up to you and how you are designing your pages. You should always use elements that are semantically appropriate to the content contained within them. If the element will always be used in a context which will require inline-block display, by all means set it to that in your style sheet. Otherwise, you will have to resort to classes or more specific selectors in order to make your elements display properly.Here is a Fiddle that gets the default display value for a majority of HTML tags.FiddleIn chrome, the default inline-block elements are: "INPUT", "BUTTON", "TEXTAREA", "SELECT"In principle, it depends on the browser what the default value for the display property is for each element. Even HTML5 drafts do not prescribe what values must be used, though it presents「expected rendering」of elements in terms of CSS.According the default style sheet for HTML in the CSS 2.1 specification, the elements that have display: inline-block by default are button, input, select, and textarea. Browsers use such settings, except that in Firefox, this only applies to button and select.In the Rendering section of HTML5 CR, the meter and progress elements are additionally describes as having inline block as「expected rendering」, and browsers that have implemented these elements appear to behave that way. The keygen element is also described as being an inline block, but Firefox does not do that (it implemented keygen internally as select in the DOM); IE does not support keygen at all; Chrome implements it as suggested.Since all of these elements have rather specialized meanings, functionality, and rendering idiosyncracies, none of them is adequate for general use as an element that is an inline block by default and may have various meanings. What you can use for such an element is normally span or div, depending on whether you prefer inline or block as the default rendering.You can check my codepen with all HTML elements and their display property by default. Some tags are syntax-broken, but it does not matter for our purpose.Currently, there are 5 elements with display: inline-block in FF :And additional 2 (including 5 above) in Chrome:button, textarea, input, and select default to inline-block.In the event you would want to inline-block a div you'd give it a class name.Then...CORRECTIONI was mistaken about img. It seems it defaults to inline and not inline-blockNow you can create a Custom Element (for example: <inline-block> or whatever) that will have its CSS property display set to inline-block by default.My solution to this is declaring what I call a slice.CSSUsageThis isn't really a true answer to the question right now, but with enough support, it may someday be.<seg> short for "segment".  As in, segments of a line.with the polyfill:It really would be nice if there was an official one, but there is not, so here is the best (IMO) suggested name for such an element that I know of.YES there is an element that defaults to inline.The answer is the span element.

But if there are elements with font-size grater then 12px, they will not change.Is there any way to do it with CSS?No. While you can set a base font size on body using the font-size property, anything after that that specifies a smaller size will override the base rule for that element. In order to do what you are looking to do you will need to use Javascript.You could iterate through the elements on the page and change the smaller fonts using something like this:Here is a Fiddle where you can see it done: http://jsfiddle.net/mifi79/LfdL8/2/In CSS3 there is a simple but brilliant hack for that:This is because the static part of calc() defines the minimum. Even though the dynamic part might shrink to something near 0.This is probably not exactly what you want, but in CSS 4, you can use the max-function. 

As of mid-December 2019, the CSS4 min/max-function is exactly what you want: 

(tread with care, all non-Chromium based browsers don't support it just yet)Example:That way the font-size will be 1em (if 1em > 12px), but at least 12px.Unfortunatly this awesome CSS3 feature isn't supported by any browsers yet, but I hope this will change soon!Edit:As per December 11th 2019, support arrived in Chrome/Chromium 79 (including on Android, and in Android WebView), and as such also in Microsoft Chredge aka Anaheim including Opera 66 and Safari 11.1 (incl. iOS)Firefox support is still missing, but Mozilla does already document it: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/min

https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/maxUse a media query. Example:

This is something im using the original size is 1.0vw but when it hits 1000 the letter gets too small so I scale it upThis site I m working on is not responsive for >500px but you might need more. The pro,benefit for this solution is you keep font size scaling without having super mini letters and you can keep it js free.Looks like I'm a bit late but for others with this issue try this codeuse whatever tag you prefer and size you prefer (replace the 3)is used for a max size.CSS Solution:Just in case if some need scss mixin:AFAIK it's not possible with plain CSS,

but you can do a pretty expensive jQuery operation like:jsBin demoInstead of using the Global Selector * I'd suggest you (if possible) to be more specific with your selectors.Judging by your above comment, you're OK doing this with jQuery — here goes:A cleaner way to do this might be to have a "min-font" class in your CSS that sets font-size: 12px, and just add the class instead:The font-min-size and font-max-size CSS properties were removed from the CSS Fonts Module Level 4 specification (and never implemented in browsers AFAIK). And the CSS Working Group replaced the CSS examples with font-size: clamp(...) which doesn't have the greatest browser support yet so we'll have to wait for browsers to support it.

I have a table and I want to set a fixed width of 30px on the td's. the problem is that when the text in the td is too long, the td is stretched out wider than 30px. Overflow:hidden doesn't work either on the td's, I need some way of hiding the overflowing text and keeping the td width 30px.It's not the prettiest CSS, but I got this to work:Examples, with and without ellipses: you also can try to use that:http://www.w3schools.com/cssref/pr_tab_table-layout.aspIt is not only the table cell which is growing, the table itself can grow, too.

To avoid this you can assign a fixed width to the table which in return forces the cell width to be respected:(Using overflow: hidden and/or text-overflow: ellipsis is optional but highly recommended for a better visual experience)So if your situation allows you to assign a fixed width to your table, this solution might be a better alternative to the other given answers (which do work with or without a fixed width)The above suggestions trashed the layout of my table so I ended up using:This is horrible to maintain but was easier than re-doing all the existing css for the site. Hope it helps someone else.Chrome 37.

for non fixed table:first two important! else - its flow away!This workaround worked for me...Put a div inside td and give following style width:50px;overflow: hidden; to the div

I am trying to dynamicly change the width of a div using CSS and no jquery. The following code will work in the following browsers: http://caniuse.com/calcI want also support IE 5.5 and higher, i found the following: expression. Is this the correct usage:Can I also support Opera and the Android browser?Almost always box-sizing: border-box can replace a calc rule such as calc(100% - 500px) used for layout.For example:If I have the following markup:Instead of doing this: (Assuming that the sidebar is 300px wide)Do this:PS: I won't work in IE 5.5 (hahahaha) , but it will work in IE8+ , all mobile, and all modern browsers (caniuse)Width DemoHeight DemoI just found this post from Paul Irish's blog where he also shows off box-sizing as a possible alternative for simple calc() expressions: (bold is mine)NB: The above technique does indeed look the same as would a corresponding calc() statement. There is a difference though. When using a calc() rule the value of the width of the content div will actually be 100% - width of fixed div, however with the above technique, the actual width of the content div is the full 100% width, yet it has the appearance of 'filling up' the remaining width. (which is probably good enough for want most people need here)That said, if it is important that the content div's width is actually 100% - fixed div width  then a different technique - which makes use of block formatting contexts - may be used (see here and here for the gory details):1) float the fixed width div2) set overflow:hidden or overflow:auto on the content divJust have a fallback before the calc will do the trick. See more here https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/calcuse thisJust spent the best part of 3 hours trying to workaround this for a specific case on andriod devices, couldnt get box sizing to work so i've linked it into my JS as a dirty workaround... no jQuery required though! :) Taken on working code on andriod 2.3.JS with event listenersHope this helps anyone who cant get the box-sizing working!

PS I have experienced problems with ios using this... Change #menuLog width with % or px and you will see magic. Works with every device even < 2.3I wanted to add the no-calc, no-border-box (i.e., CSS2) alternative.Normal-flow block elements initially have width: auto, which is effectively the width of the containing block minus the margin, border, and padding widths.The example above can be done, without border-box, simply asSimilarly, withthe effective width is 100% - 1px - 1em - 1rem.For absolutely positioned elements, height: auto has similar properties:Here the effective height is 100% - 1px - 1em - 1rem.

The middle bit I'm talking about is the white div, midcontent which has CSS values:So yes, obviously height:100% didn't work. Additionally, ALL parent containers have height set.Here's the general structureDid you remember setting the height of the html and body tags in your CSS? This is generally how I've gotten DIVs to extend to full height:This might be of some help: http://www.webmasterworld.com/forum83/200.htmA relevant quote:This is an old question. CSS has evolved. There now is the vh (viewport height) unit, also new layout options like flexbox or CSS grid to achieve classical designs in cleaner ways.In case also setting the height of the html and the body to 100% makes everything messier for you as it did for me, the following worked for me:The - 33rem is the height of the elements coming after the one we want to take full height, i.e., 100vh. By subtracting the height, we will make sure there is no overflow and it will always be responsive (assuming we are working with rem instead of px).if setting height to 100% doesn't work, try min-height=100% for div. You still have to set the html tag.

My HTML code is just dividing the pages into two columns, 65%,35% respectively.In the response div, I have variable data; in the note div, I have fixed data. 

Even though the two divs have two different sets of data, I need them to display with the same height so that the background colors appear to fill a box containing both. Naturally, the problem is the response div, as its height varies depending on the amount of data currently being displayed within it.How might I ensure that the height of the two columns are always equal?Wrap them in a containing div with the background color applied to it, and have a clearing div after the 'columns'.Updated to address some comments and my own thoughts:This method works because its essentially a simplification of your problem, in this somewhat 'oldskool' method I put two columns in followed by an empty clearing element, the job of the clearing element is to tell the parent (with the background) this is where floating behaviour ends, this allows the parent to essentially render 0 pixels of height at the position of the clear, which will be whatever the highest priorly floating element is.The reason for this is to ensure the parent element is as tall as the tallest column, the background is then set on the parent to give the appearance that both columns have the same height.It should be noted that this technique is 'oldskool' because the better choice is to trigger this height calculation behaviour with something like clearfix or by simply having overflow: hidden on the parent element.Whilst this works in this limited scenario, if you wish for each column to look visually different, or have a gap between them, then setting a background on the parent element won't work, there is however a trick to get this effect.The trick is to add bottom padding to all columns, to the max amount of size you expect that could be the difference between the shortest and tallest column, if you can't work this out then pick a large figure, you then need to add a negative bottom margin of the same number.You'll need overflow hidden on the parent object, but the result will be that each column will request to render this additional height suggested by the margin, but not actually request layout of that size (because the negative margin counters the calculation). This will render the parent at the size of the tallest column, whilst allowing all the columns to render at their height + the size of bottom padding used, if this height is larger than the parent then the rest will simply clip off.You can see an example of this technique on the bowers and wilkins website (see the four horizontal spotlight images the bottom of the page).If you are trying to force a floating div to match another to create a column effect, this is what I do. I like it because it's simple and clean.I think this makes sense. It seems to work well even with dynamic content.Here is a jQuery plugin to set the heights of multiple divs to be the same. And below is the actual code of the plugin.The correct solution for this problem is to use display: table-cellImportant: This solution doesn't need float since table-cell already turns the div into an element that lines up with the others in the same container. That also means you don't have to worry about clearing floats, overflow, background shining through and all the other nasty surprises that the float hack brings along to the party.CSS:HTML:Related:You should wrap them in a div with no float.I also use the clearfix patch on here http://www.webtoolkit.info/css-clearfix.htmlI can't understand why this issue gets pounded into the ground when in 30 seconds you can code a two-column table and solve the problem.This div column height problem comes up all over a typical layout. Why resort to scripting when a plain old basic HTML tag will do it? Unless there are huge and numerous tables on a layout, I don't buy the argument that tables are significantly slower.Flex does this by default.CSS: https://jsfiddle.net/784pnojq/1/BONUS: multiple rowshttps://jsfiddle.net/784pnojq/2/I recommend you wrap them both in an outer div with the desired background color.You can always use a background image to do it too. I tend to vote for this option 100% of the time as the only other perfect solution is the Jquery option.As with using the outer div with a background color you'll end up having to have the content in both divs reaching the same height.This code will let you have a variable number of rows (with a variable number of DIVs on each row) and it will make all of the DIVs on each row match the height of its tallest neighbour:If we assumed all the DIVs, that are floating, are inside a container with the id "divContainer", then you could use the following:Having had the same sort of problem as well, requiring three divs next to each other with different content, with right-borders to 'seperate' them, the only solution that worked was a slightly modified version of the jQuery option in another answer. Remember you also need the script found here.Below is my slightly modified version of the script, which just allows for a true min-height setting (as I needed my boxes to be at least a certain height).It works like a charm and doesn't slow anything down :)

Cheers.Here's where I found the above:

https://productforums.google.com/forum/#!topic/chrome/tYHSqc-fqsoI got it fixed with the JS solution, but also needed to use the latest google hosted jquery (1.11) to get it fixed.I just faced the same issue. I it was due to HTTP/S protocol mismatch as described here. Use https version of URL.See similar problem in question Strange Issue while Google Font Rendering.Solution is in loading the desired font (I my case 'Fira Sans') from the Mozilla CDN instead of Google CDN.It is not a actual solution but it works better for me than everything else in this thread. I changed the font. I had Fira Sans and now just changed to Roboto which works out of the box. i just used to delete roboto font from my windows fonts and every thing work right now.it is maybe beacause you have older version of font on your system . i guess .I was trying to work with Meg's answer,but like many others it didn't work for me either.For using Google Font,found this trick[Adding Screenshots for steps].1) Just take the url from the css or standard link as highlighted.2) Open the link in another tab, copy whole css code(i.e. font-face) in your css file and run.Not sure about performance as many http calls are getting added, or just try copying one font-face.Image for step 1

Image for step 2

It's possible that the element has text-rendering: optimizeLegibility set which can cause this, or similar, issues.  Changing it to auto fixed this problem for me with a Foundation 5 project that sets it to optimizeLegibility by default.If anyone is still struggling with this issue (2019), there seems to be a bug in Google Fonts CSS generator script.I loaded my fonts with the following tag:Every @font-face in the file contained a line like this:As you can see, the local('sans-serif') is placed prior to the remote URL, which is wrong. This causes Chrome to load the default sans-serif font instead of the requested one.A simple fix is to reorder the font-weight part of the URL, from Roboto:400,300 to Roboto:300,400. This causes the generator to not include the local('sans-serif') source.Hope it helps someone.I'm just sharing what worked for me. Your results may vary.I had main.css with an @import of multiple fonts, separated by a | (pipe) character. This had been working up until today. I kept all of my Google Font imports in the main CSS file because I didn't have that many. Today I added one that simply wouldn't render, either in Chrome or Firefox. I tried a different font - same problem.Finally, I made a separate @import in another CSS file that gets loaded for several pages on the site (let's call it navbar_pages.css, for example) - this CSS gets included in the relevant pages via <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="/css/navbar_pages.css">, just like main.css does.For some reason, having the @import in a separate CSS file solved the problem.I suspect it is due to a limit on the number of fonts that can be called in a single @import call. More testing should be done to pin down the cause, but for now there is my workaround. If anyone has insights, please chime in with a comment.It may not be a silver bullet, but fixe the issue on our site by moving the fontawesome css link to the bottom of our pages as well as weblike fix listed above.If people are still having this problem before you try all the great solutions on here try using an !important tag in your css to see if that will fix it, as it did for me and I am not sure if the bug is the same as the old Chrome bug.Checkout plugin I made: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/fontfix/ekgfbmjaehhpbakdbpfmlepngjkaalokIt does the web realign with pure javascript, which force browser to redraw whole page.

However, I just noticed that my default-type text inputs do not get the styles. Why is this the case? And how can I address this?The CSS uses only the data in the DOM tree, which has little to do with how the renderer decides what to do with elements with missing attributes.So either let the CSS reflect the HTMLor make the HTML explicit.If it didn't do that, you'd never be able to distinguish betweenand because all attributes would always be defined on all elements. (For example, table always has a border attribute, with 0 for a default.)By CSS specifications, browsers may or may not use information about default attributes; mostly the don’t. The relevant clause in the CSS 2.1 spec is 5.8.2 Default attribute values in DTDs. In CSS 3 Selectors, it’s clause 6.3.4, with the same name. It recommends:「Selectors should be designed so that they work whether or not the default values are included in the document tree.」It is generally best to explicitly specify essential attributes such as type=text instead of defaulting them. The reason is that there is no simple reliable way to refer to the input elements with defaulted type attribute.Because, it is not supposed to do that.input[type=text] { } is an attribute selector, and will only select those element, with the matching attribute.To be compliant with all browsers you should always declare the input type. Some browsers will assume default type as 'text', but this isn't a good practice.try this

How to optimize website for touch devices

[How to optimize website for touch devices](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2607248/how-to-optimize-website-for-touch-devices)

On a touch device like iPhone/iPad/Android it can be difficult to hit a small button with your finger. There is no cross-browser way to detect touch devices with CSS media queries that I know of. So I check if the browser has support for Javascript touch events. Until now, other browsers haven't supported them, but the latest Google Chrome on dev channel enabled touch events (even for non touch devices). And I suspect other browser makers will follow, since laptops with touch screens are coming. Update: It was a bug in Chrome, so now the JavaScript detection works again.This is the test I use:The problem is that this only tests if the browser has support for touch events, not the device.Does anyone know of The Correct[tm] way of giving touch devices better user experience? Other than sniffing user agent.Mozilla has a media query for touch devices. But I haven't seen anything like it in any other browser:

https://developer.mozilla.org/En/CSS/Media_queries#-moz-touch-enabledUpdate: I want to avoid using a separate page/site for mobile/touch devices.

The main reason I asked, was to make sure it's not possible today, before I contact the css3 working group. So please don't answer if you can't follow the requirements in the question ;)It sounds to me like you want to have a touch-screen-friendly option, to cover the following scenarios:For case 1 and 2 you will probably need a separate site or a CSS file that eliminates lots of unnecessary content and makes things larger and easier to read/navigate.  If you care about case #2 then as long as the links/buttons on the page are keyboard-navigable then case 1 and 2 are equivalent.For case 3 you have your normal website.  For case 4 it sounds like you want clickable things to be bigger or easier to touch.  If it's not possible to simply make everything bigger for all users, an alternate style-sheet can provide you with the touch-friendly layout changes.The easiest thing to do is provide a link to the touch-screen-version of the site somewhere on the page.  For well-known touch devices such as iPad you can sniff the user agent and set the touch stylesheet as the default.  However I'd consider making this the default for everyone; if your design looks good on the iPad it should look acceptably good on any notebook.  Your mouse users with less-than-stellar clicking skills will be pleased to find bigger click targets, especially if you add appropriate :hover or mouseover effects to let users know that things are clickable.I know you said you don't want to sniff user-agents.  But I'd contend that at this time the state of browser support for this is in too much flux to worry about the "Correct" way to do it.  Browsers will eventually provide the information that you need, but you will probably find that it will be years before this information is ubiquitous.Good news! The editor draft of CSS4 Media Queries have included a new media feature 'pointer'.It's also possible to test the media query from JavaScript:Updated Feb. 11th. 2013 On Windows 8 recent versions of Chrome (version 24+) detect touch-hardware when launching the application and expose touch events. Unfortunately if "pointer:coarse" returns false, there is no way to know if it's because pointer media queries are not implemented or because there is a fine pointer. WebKit haven't implemented "pointer:fine" yet, so we can't check that either.Update Sept. 26th. 2012

Tested in Safari on iOS6 and Chrome on Android 4.1.1 and it's not there yet. 'pointer' and 'hover' media-queries landed in WebKit May 30th. According to the User-Agent, Safari uses WebKit branch 536.26 from April 25th, and Chrome on Android uses and even older one (535.19). Not sure WebKit branches from User-Agent strings are to be trusted, but my test page is not able to detect pointer media queries either.

The implementation from May only implements the pointer media query for touch devices, so pointer: fine won't work for devices with a mouse.I don't know if a standardized media query like Mozilla's will solve the problem by itself.  Like one of the Chromium developers said in that discussion you linked, the presence of touch event support in the browser doesn't mean touch events can or will fire, or even if they do, that the user will only want to interact via touch input.  Likewise, the presence of touch input support in the device doesn't mean the user will use that method of input - perhaps the device supports mouse, keyboard, and touch input and the user prefers the mouse or some combination of the three input types.  I agree with the Chromium developer that supporting touch events was not a bug in the browser.  A good browser should support touch events because it might be installed on a device that supports touch input.  It's the website developer's fault that he took the event support to mean the user would be interacting via touch.It seems we need to know two things:

(1) What are all the supported input types on the device

(2) What are all the supported event types in the browserSince we don't know #1 right now, there is one approach proposed by PPK of quirksmode that I like.  He talks about it here: http://www.quirksmode.org/blog/archives/2010/02/do_we_need_touc.html#link4Basically, listen for touch events and mouse events, and when they happen, set up the UI accordingly.  Obviously that's limiting to the developer.  I don't think it's a valid approach to your problem with link size because you don't want to wait for interaction to alter the UI.  The whole point is to present a different UI (a larger/smaller link) before any interaction occurs.I hope you make your proposal and it gets included in CSS3.  Until then, as much as it pains me to say it, user agent sniffing looks like the best approach.p.s. I hope hope hope someone comes here and proves me wrongGoogle Chrome has a command line switch for enabling touch events. Disabled by default. So until they enable them for everyone again (hopefully they won't), it's possible to detect touch with the help of javascript like I described in the question..Update jun 3 2010: This actually got into the stable version on 25th of May 2010 :( Don't know it it was a mistake or not.Have discussed the issue on the w3c mailing list, but I doubt anything will happen very soon. http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-style/2010May/0411.html

They might discuss this during TPAC in November.Update sep 30 2010: Supposedly fixed in Chrome 6. Haven't had time to downgrade to stable yet to verify. Since Chrome upgrade automatically this problem should already be gone :)Read this if you're considering using media queries:

http://www.cloudfour.com/css-media-query-for-mobile-is-fools-gold/

and http://www.quirksmode.org/blog/archives/2010/09/more_about_medi.htmlUpdate may 16th 2011: W3C is now working on a Touch Events specification, but more or less refused to hide touch events for terminals without touch hardware. So don't expect the touch event detection to work for long.Update june 6th 2012: The W3C CSS4 Media Queries (Editors Draft) spec have something very interesting. See my separate answer about this.No, there is no such thing.

CSS has the screen size option, which will allow you to optimize layout, but that's all.

There is also media="handheld" but that also doesn't apply to your requirements.Feature detection might work using javascript, however, there are issues with different events for different devices.  PPK (the man behind quirksmode.org) is doing a huge amount of work checking what javascript is possible for each mobile/handheld device, and it's proving that nothing seems to be standard with these devices and yet this STILL doesn't apply to your requirement for touch laptop devices.

(honestly I dont know why you are concerned about a device that isn't even out yet, be pragmatic and worry about it once it's here and you can test it)PPK's work on mobile browser and touch events, will save you hours.  Check it out hereApple has TouchEvents defined only for iPhone OS FWIWNot a complete solution, but you might want to simply outright avoid any small buttons. While small buttons are more of a usability problem on touch devices, they are always hard to use, even with a big screen & mouse.If you just pay attention to using suitably big buttons with enough space between them, everyone will benefit. Plus, it will force you not to clutter your interface with too many small buttons :-).try using tables and make a full cell to be a link...

i'm working on that in my website...

it's not working well so far...

but you might find a way...

on this way, no need to overload your website with javascript and functionality detection...

you can give it a relative size instread of a fixed size...

and in this way, your website can be viewed in a desktop as is viewed in a iphone...

think about this idea...

any sugestion is apreciated...See http://crbug.com/136119 for support for adding pointer:fine in Chrome.  It is actually possible to detect whether pointer:coarse is supported (to distinguish unset from not supported) - just create the media query yourself and test in javascript whether it parsed properly.Eg., today "@media (pointer:coarse)" in Chrome shows up:But unsupported bogus values like "@media (pointer:other)" don't:You won't have any control over detecting touches, and even if you did the logic steps to figure out what exactly the user is trying to touch is complex and best handled by the device itself. Your best bet is to create a mobile version of the site or an alternate stylesheet that is loaded when you detect a mobile device with Javascript.If you are using PHP, this is a good solution:http://chrisschuld.com/projects/browser-php-detecting-a-users-browser-from-php/You can detect whether the browser is a phone from the serverside by sniffing the browser request details, and if so, display alternative/extra stylesheets/js/html

Should I run separate instances of webpack for these separate modules? Should I even be using webpack for non-JS assets if I'm not going to mix them into my JS?Maybe not. Webpack is definitely js-centric, with the implicit assumption that what you're building is a js application. Its implementation of require() allows you to treat everything as a module (including Sass/LESS partials, JSON, pretty much anything), and automatically does your dependency management for you (everything that you require is bundled, and nothing else).People do this because they're defining a piece of their application (e.g. a React component, a Backbone View) with js. That piece of the application has CSS that goes with it. Depending on some external CSS resource that's built separately and not directly referenced from the js module is fragile, harder to work with, and can lead to styles getting out of date, etc. Webpack encourages you to keep everything modular, so you have a CSS (Sass, whatever) partial that goes with that js component, and the js component require()s it to make the dependency clear (to you and to the build tool, which never builds styles you don't need). I don't know if you could use webpack to bundle CSS on its own (when the CSS files aren't referenced from any js). I'm sure you could wire something up with plugins, etc., but not sure it's possible out of the box. If you do reference the CSS files from your js, you can easily bundle the CSS into a separate file with the Extract Text plugin, as you say. A separate CSS bundle can be generated without using require('main/less) in any of your JS, but as Brendan pointed out in the first part of his answer Webpack isn't designed for a global CSS bundle to go alongside modular JS, however there are a couple of options.The first is to add an extra entry point for main.less, then use the Extract Text plugin to create the CSS bundle:The problem with this method is you also generate an unwanted JS file as well as the bundle, in this example: style.js which is just an empty Webpack module.Another option is to add the main less file to an existing Webpack entry point:This is ideal if you have only 1 entry point, but if you have more, then your Webpack config will look a bit odd as you'll have to arbitrarily choose which entry point to add the main less file to.To further clarify bdmason's former answer - it seems the desirable configuration would be to create a JS and CSS bundle for each page, like so:And then use the [name] switch:Full configuration - with some additions not connected to the question (we're actually using SASS instead of LESS):Yes, this is possible but like others said you will need additional packages to do so (see devDependencies under package.json). here is the sample code that I used to compile my bootstrap SCSS --> CSS and Bootstrap JS --> JS.webpack.config.js:additional postcss.config.js file:package.json:See the tutorial here: https://florianbrinkmann.com/en/4240/sass-webpackthe webpack team recommends using mini-css-extract over the extract text plugin this solution allows you to create a separate chunk containing only your css entries: Here is a more contrived example using mutliple entries from one of my personal projects: I realize this approach is not very modular, but it should give you a foundation to build from and is an excellent strategy for adopting webpack in projects where you do not wish to inter-mix javascript and css. The downside to this approach is that css-loader still generates an additional javascript file (whether you choose to use it or not), this will supposedly be fixed in webpack 5. I don't see anything wrong with this but ultimately it depends on your tolerance for managing multiple build systems. To me this feels like overkill, so my preference is to remain in the webpack ecosystem. For more information on the strategies outlined above, please see https://github.com/webpack-contrib/mini-css-extract-plugin#extracting-css-based-on-entryYou can also put your Less require statements in your entry JS file also:in body.jsThen in webpack

One simple way to make an object centered in HTML is using  align='center', but it's not working for a div.I tried:I even true a center tagBut I can't make my target div to be center.Tested and worked in IE, Firefox, Chrome, Safari and Opera. I did not test IE6. The outer text-align is needed for IE. Other browsers (and IE9?) will work when you give the DIV margin (left and right) value of auto. Margin "0 auto" is a shorthand for margin "0 auto 0 auto" (top right bottom left).Note: the text is also centered inside the inner DIV, if you want it to remain on the left side just specify text-align: left; for the inner DIV.Edit: IE 6, 7, 8 and 9 running on the Standards Mode will work with margins set to auto.I think that the the align="center" aligns the content, so if you wanted to use that method, you would need to use it in a 'wraper' div - a div that just wraps the rest.text-align is doing a similar sort of thing. left:50% is ignored unless you set the div's position to be something like relative or absolute.The generally accepted methods is to use the following propertiesthe margins being auto means they grow/shrink to match the browser window (or parent div)UPDATEThanks to Meo for poiting this out, if you wanted to you could save time and use the short hand propery for the margin.this defines the top and bottom as 0 (as it is zero it does not matter about lack of units) and the left and right get defined as 'auto' You can then, if you wan't override say  the top margin as you would with any other CSS rules.it depends if your div is in position: absolute / fixed or relative / staticfor position: absolute & fixedThe trick here is to have a negative margin half the width of the objectfor position: relative & staticfor both techniques it is imperative to set de widthhow about something along these lines

I can hack this myself, but I think bootstrap has this capability.Using jQuery it's quite trivial.  v2.0 uses the table class on all tables.There is a javascript plugin that adds this feature to bootstrap.When rowlink.js is included you can do:The table will be converted so that the whole row can be clicked instead of only the first column.That code transforms any bootstrap table row that has data-href attribute set into a clickable elementNote: data-href attribute is a valid tr attribute (HTML5), href attributes on tr element are not.I show you my example with modal windows...you create your modal and give it an id

then

In your table you have tr section, just ad the first line you see below (don't forget to set the  on the first row like this 

May be you are trying to attach a function when table rows are clicked.You can use in this way using bootstrap css. Just remove the active class if already assinged to any row and reassign to the current row.

Also Check this jsfiddleI'm assuming that the buttons are supposed to be next to each other on the same line, they should not each be centered using the 'auto' margin, but placed inside a div with a defined width that has a margin '0 auto':CSS:HTML (after removing the margin properties from your buttons' CSS):One simple solution if only one button needs to be centered is something like:You can use a similar style to handle several buttons.

&nbsp; is a non breaking space, which represents an empty space where no line break occurs.If I useI have a space between two passages (bigger break). If I useI only have a new line between the two passage (no break). Why?

2012-09-05 10:41:07Z

&nbsp; is a non breaking space, which represents an empty space where no line break occurs.If I useI have a space between two passages (bigger break). If I useI only have a new line between the two passage (no break). Why?In HTML, elements containing nothing but normal whitespace characters are considered empty. A paragraph that contains just a normal space character will have zero height. A non-breaking space is a special kind of whitespace character that isn't considered to be insignificant, so it can be used as content for a non-empty paragraph.Even if you consider CSS margins on paragraphs, since an "empty" paragraph has zero height, its vertical margins will collapse. This causes it to have no height and no margins, making it appear as if it were never there at all.How about a workaround?

In my case I took the value of the textarea in a jQuery variable, and changed all "<p>&nbsp" to <p class="clear"> and clear class to have certain height and margin, as the following example:jQuerythe val is then saved to the database with the new val.CSSYou can adjust the height & margin as you wish.

And since 'p' is a display: block element. it should give you the expected output.Hope that helps!If I understand your issue this should work&emsp—the em space; this should be a very wide space, typically as much as four real spaces.

&ensp—the en space; this should be a somewhat wide space, roughly two regular spaces.

&thinsp—this will be a narrow space, even more narrow than a regular space.Sources: http://hea-www.harvard.edu/~fine/Tech/html-sentences.html

[Flexbox wraps last column of the first row in Safari](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/34250282/flexbox-wraps-last-column-of-the-first-row-in-safari)

The last column of the first row is wrapped to the next line when viewing in Safari, and some other iOS based browsers.Safari:Chrome / Others:Code:

2015-12-13 10:50:43Z

The last column of the first row is wrapped to the next line when viewing in Safari, and some other iOS based browsers.Safari:Chrome / Others:Code:ExplanationThis happens because Safari treats :before and :after pseudo-elements as if they were real elements. E.g. think about a container with 7 items. If container has :before and :after Safari will position the items like this:SolutionAs an alternative to the accepted answer I remove :before & :after from flex containers instead of altering the HTML. In your case:Just to update on my questionThis is the solution I go with, this is obviously fixed for Bootstrap4, which is flexbox compatible. So this is only for bootstrap3.I know the issue is quite old, but I ran into this issue today, and wasted over 12 hours in fixing it. Though about 10 hours out of that were spent in realizing that safari is failing with 12-column bootstrap grid, and it is no other issue.Fix that I made is rather simple. Here is the version for Visual Composer. Class names may vary for other frameworks.I didn't want to add more classes to fix this kind of bug, 

so alternatively you can fix the .row class itself.Found this issue trying to do a simple grid using Bootstrap for the TwentyThree CMS, and got the same bug in Safari. Anyway, this solved it for me:I was able to fix it by addingObviously this isn't the most elegant solution but it may work for some in the meantime until they fix it.I've spent a few hours on this issue as well. In my case I inserted flexbox in an existing project to make all elements in a row have the same height. All browsers except Safari rendered it correctly, but none of the above answers seemed to fix my problem.Until I discovered that there still was a Bootstrap clearfix hack being used:

(code is from a laravel project, but generic Bootstrap otherwise)Apparently, other browsers than Safari ignore the .clearfix in some way when flexbox is being used.So, when using flexbox on your columns, there is no need to use Bootstrap's clearfix anymore.Bootstrap 4 have issues with display: block; property when set either from css or from javascript on the .row class. I figured a solution for this

Just create a class as:And then apply this class when you want to display the row.This seems to be a bug in Safari's rendering causing the columns to overflow (and therefore wrap) the Bootstrap container (some kind of Webkit rounding error maybe?). Since you are using Bootstrap, you should be able to achieve the desired result without using flex:But! Now the problem looking at your example is that you need to keep your product blocks the exact same size or the grid won't keep it's shape. One possible solution is to give .product a fixed height and adjust using media queries.Here is an example I made that works in Safari and other browsers: 

http://codepen.io/anon/pen/PZbNMX

Additionally, you can use style rules to keep images or description text within a certain size to make things easier to maintain.Another possible solution is to use a script or jQuery plugin to allow for more dynamic uniform sizing, but I'm not as savvy with that stuff.I ran into the same issue when trying to combine flex and Bootstrap using Safari, so I hope this helps.I had the same problem and the answer was that Flex box on safari doesn't seem to like the floats being cleared on the same div that is display: flex. In case you are using display flex with flex-wrap i solved it applying a hight order to the before and after pseudo-elements of the row, so they position as the last elements.

I was wondering if there is a CSS or javascript magic that could place a marker in an html text so that the browser know where the line break creation is preffered when the text gets cramped. Is there such thing?I think this works very well:The text still breaks on other places when there is not enough space:open demoIs the <wbr> tag (word break) what you are looking for?It's not CSS or JS, but can be placed directly in the HTMLUnfortunately, there is no way in HTML or CSS to express that some allowed line break point is more preferable than some other. If there were, we could expect to find it in the CSS3 Text module, but its current draft has nothing like that – just ways to control how allowed line break points are determined.What you can do is to disallow line breaks where they would normally be allowed. Typically, a space implies a line breaking opportunity, but using a no-break space (which can be written as &nbsp; if desired) you forbid that. For example, if you have a heading text like「A bridge across the Irish Sea and four other amazing plans」, then you might say that there is the best line breaking opportunity is after「and」, a good opportunity after「across」, and a rather bad (though permissible) after「Irish」, and so on. But you can’t do that in HTML or CSS, and typically not in typesetting programs either. You can just allow or disallow breaks, e.g. as in <h1>A&nbsp;bridge across the&nbsp;Irish&nbsp;Sea and four&nbsp;other amazing&nbsp;plans</h1>. For headings and headlines, this might make sense, even though it means that you consider each space and decide whether to make it non-breaking.You can put text into spans and prevent line breaks inside them. This way line breaks could only happen between two spans:I definitely understand why you want this, and there have certainly been times that I have looked at a layout and at first thought, wanted the same thing.But I wouldn't be doing due justice if I didn't mention that doing this can cause some major word flow issues.Do you have a responsive website? If so, just changing the size of the viewport on your browser can turn a nice looking line of word broken text into something that looks terrible.And even if you don't have a responsive website, and are using pixel-perfect design, all someone needs to do is change the size of the font and everything will go crazy.I would rethink this decision. Just my opinion, though.

My understanding is that mime types are set by the web server. Why do we add the type="text/javascript or type="text/css" attribute? Isn't this a useless and ignored attribute?Douglas Crockford says:He also says:For entertainment purposes only, I tried out the following five scriptsOn Chrome, all but script 3 (type="baloney") worked.  IE8 did not run script 1 (type="application/ecmascript") or script 3.  Based on my non-extensive sample of two browsers, it looks like you can safely ignore the type attribute, but that it you use it you better use a legal (browser dependent) value.Because, at least in HTML 4.01 and XHTML 1(.1), the type attribute for <script> elements is required.In HTML 5, type is no longer required.In fact, while you should use text/javascript in your HTML source, many servers will send the file with Content-type: application/javascript. Read more about these MIME types in RFC 4329.Notice the difference between RFC 4329, that marked text/javascript as obsolete and recommending the use of application/javascript, and the reality in which some browsers freak out on <script> elements containing type="application/javascript" (in HTML source, not the HTTP Content-type header of the file that gets send). Recently, there was a discussion on the WHATWG mailing list about this discrepancy (HTML 5's type defaults to text/javascript), read these messages with subject Will you consider about RFC 4329?Boris Zbarsky (Mozilla), who probably knows more about the innards of Gecko than anyone else, provided at http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-html/2009Apr/0195.html the pseudocode repeated below to describe what Gecko based browsers do:It allows browsers to determine if they can handle the scripting/style language before making a request for the script or stylesheet (or, in the case of embedded script/style, identify which language is being used).This would be much more important if there had been more competition among languages in browser space, but VBScript never made it beyond IE and PerlScript never made it beyond an IE specific plugin while JSSS was pretty rubbish to begin with.The draft of HTML5 makes the attribute optional.

What is the best way to represent a perfect third in CSS like this? Maybe just 33.33%?Now that calc is widely supported among modern browsers, you can use:Or you can use this as a fallback if your browser wouldn't support it:Are you making any allowance for margins? You could go 30% per column with 5% margin either side of the center column.Quick exampleThe highest resolution screen is a non-production NEC LCD screen with a resolution of 2800x2100. Even at that size, one pixel is 0.0357% of the width of the screen. So 33.33% should be close enough until 5,000-pixel-wide screens become the norm.John Resig did some research into sub-pixel rounding in different browsers, though, so depending on your three columns to equal exactly the width of the screen may never have a perfect solution.

Should I do some nesting here, or am I naming my blocks and elements wrong?Nesting example in CSS:Or should I name it like this:Can you help?There are a number of variants on how to write BEM classes, so be aware that are multiple competing standards. It started as a set of loose guidelines. Since posting this answer, Yandex has significantly overhauled their official standard (it's quite an improvement). The version of BEM I use is based heavily from an article by Nicolas Gallagher.At this point I use "Atomic OOBEMITLESS", which is really just a way of saying that classes are modular and namespaced, selectors have low specificity, and states may be toggled with classes which allows CSS to be scaled, on top of a CSS preprocessor to make the code more concise and expressive.All that said, I will be using the following BEM standard:BEM short form: block-name__element-name--modifier-nameYou have three different blocks in your examples:The sidebar and content blocks appear to be variations on the same block, and could be represented as .region.region--sidebar and .region.region--content.The nav block is implicit on the ul element, and you should make it explicit:Once you've specified that the ul element is a nav block, it makes sense to have the nav block be modified:Once you've set up the CSS classes, styling all nav__item elements is simply:and overriding those styles for the content nav__item elements is:You should probably have a look at BEM's FAQ.Whereas the DOM representation of the block may be nested:Besides the fact that the classes look much nicer, it makes the elements be dependent on the block only. So, you can easily move them across the block when providing changes to the interface. The changes of the block DOM structure would not need corresponding changes to the CSS code.Consider idea of _key_value pairs for modifiers (block or element is separated from modifier name with one underscore and its value with another one).That makes sense to distinguish modifiers one from another (e.g. nav_type_content and nav_type_sidebar are both about the place where nav apper on the page but modifiers setting theme, size or making links work via ajax are different) and so to understand which modifiers can't be used together on one DOM-node.Also it's more convenient to work with key: value pairs in javascript.And there are quite a lot of ready-made components and tools which uses such convention: https://github.com/bem/
