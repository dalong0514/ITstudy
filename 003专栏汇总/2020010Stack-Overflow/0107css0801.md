How can we get rid of it?I have tried the following:But they do not effect the blue highlighting on press of a cursor.Takes care of the problem, as it sets the highlight color transparent.Source: http://samcroft.co.uk/2012/alternative-to-webkit-tap-highlight-color-in-phonegap-apps/As far as I have known,Vlad K's answer could cause problems in some android devices.Better solution:Simply add this to your stylesheet and simply add the class="no_highlights" attribute to the element you wish to apply this class to. or you can do this globally for all the elements by removing class name and doing this.

Generated function body:  { backgroundImage:{ url(image) }".The documentation says to use either 'Kebab-case' or 'camel-case'.Heres a fiddle: https://jsfiddle.net/0dw9923f/2/The issue is that the value for backgroundImage needs to be a string like this:Here's a simplified fiddle that's working: https://jsfiddle.net/89af0se9/1/Re: the comment below about kebab-case, this is how you can do that:In other words, the value for v-bind:style is just a plain Javascript object and follows the same rules.UPDATE: One other note about why you may have trouble getting this to work.You should make sure your image value is quoted so that the end resulting string is:Otherwise, if your image URL has special characters in it (such as whitespace or parentheses) the browser may not apply it properly. In Javascript, the assignment would look like:orTechnically, this could be done in the template, but the escaping required to keep it valid HTML isn't worth it.More info here:  Is quoting the value of url() really necessary?Binding background image style using a dynamic value from v-for loop could be done like this. Another solution:What makes this solution more convenient?

Firstly, it's cleaner. And then, if you're using Vue CLI (I assume you do), you can load it by webpack.Note: don't forget that require() is always relative to the current file's path.I experienced an issue where background images with spaces in the filename where causing the style to not be applied. To correct this I had to ensure the string path was encapsulated in single quotes.Note the escaped \' in my example below.For single repeated component this technic work for methere are multiple ways but i found template string easy and simple

I want to always show vertical scrollbar in my webpage. Is it possible using javascript? I think it is possible using javascript or jQuery. I want vertical scrollbar whether there is enough content to show or not. thanks.jQuery shouldn't be required. You could try adding the CSS:This works across the latest browsers, even IE6.Just a note: In OS X Lion, overflow set to "scroll" behaves more like auto in that scrollbars will only show when being used. They will disappear when not in use. So if any the solutions above don't appear to be working that might be why.This is what you'll need to fix it:You can style it accordingly.Just use CSS.set the overflow property of a containing div to scroll.try calling a function on the onload method of your body tag and in that function change the style of body like this document.body.style.overflow = 'scroll'; also you might need to set the width of your html as this will show horizontal scroll bars as wellyour html file will look something like thisHere is a method. This will not only provide scrollbar container, but will also show the scrollbar even if content isnt enough (as per your requirement). Would also work on Iphone, and android devices as well..Add the class to the div you want to be scrollable.overflow-x: hidden; hides the horizantal scrollbar.

While overflow-y: scroll; allows you to scroll vertically.Tried to do the solution with:But I ended up with two scrollbars in Firefox in this case. So I recommend to use it on the html element like this:

Assume this:  How Can I only change the width property of class with :before selector (and not one without it) using JQuery?  I don't think there's a jQuery-way to directly access the pseudoclass' rules, but you could always append a new style element to the document's head like:See a live demo hereI also remember having seen a plugin that tackles this issue once but I couldn't find it on first googling unfortunately.Pseudo elements are part of the shadow DOM and can not be modified (but can have their values queried).However, sometimes you can get around that by using classes, for example.This may not be suitable for your query, but it does demonstrate you can achieve this pattern sometimes.To get a pseudo element's value, try some code like...Pseudo-elements are not part of the DOM, so they can't be manipulated using jQuery or Javascript.But as pointed out in the accepted answer, you can use the JS to append a style block which ends of styling the pseudo-elements. The answer should be Jain. You can not select an element via pseudo-selector, but you can add a new rule to your stylesheet with insertRule.I made something that should work for you:http://fiddle.jshell.net/MDyxg/1/To be super-cool (and to answer the question really) I rolled it out again and wrapped this in a jQuery-plugin (however, jquery is still not required!):The usage is quite simple:https://gist.github.com/yckart/5563717You may try to inherit property from the base class:One option is to use an attribute on the image, and modify that using jQuery. Then take that value in CSS:HTML (note I'm  assuming .cloumn is a div but it could be anything):jQuery:And then in order to use that value in CSS:This will grab the attribute value from .column, and apply it on the before.Sources: CSS attr (note the examples with before), jQuery attr.As Boltclock states in his answer to Selecting and manipulating CSS pseudo-elements such as ::before and ::after using jQueryMight just be best to set the style with jQuery instead of using the pseudo CSS selector.

To solve it, you need to add position:relative to the container. Since in your case body is the container, I'd suggest you add a div  directly under the body and give it position:relative. It should solve your problem.This problem is apparently a known bug for IE 6 + 7, which was fixed in IE8.To avoid this, in this case you can replace:with:This however gave some problems with the background I used on the infobox div, but nothing I couldn't solve with a few style hacks.

Is this something possible?If not, how do I do a float: right under flex?You can't use float inside flex container and the reason is that float property does not apply to flex-level boxes as you can see here Fiddle. So if you want to position child element to right of parent element you can use margin-left: auto but now child element will also push other div to the right as you can see here Fiddle. What you can do now is change order of elements and set order: 2 on child element so it doesn't affect second divYou don't need floats. In fact, they're useless because floats are ignored in flexbox.You also don't need CSS positioning.There are several flex methods available. auto margins have been mentioned in another answer.Here are two other options:

I've come up with a Script solution. (I don't think this can be done using pure CSS)the HTML stays the same as you posted, the CSS changes a little bit, JQuery code added.Working Fiddle Tested on: IE10, IE9, IE8, FF, ChromeBTW: if you have unique elements, why don't you use id's instead of classes?

I think it gives a better selector performance.Explanation of how it works:

inner-container will span the entire space of the outer-container (so basically, he's not needed) but I left him there, so you wont need to change you DOM.the table-header is relatively positioned, without a scroll (overflow: hidden), we will handle his scroll later.the table-body have to span the rest of the inner-container height, so I used a script to determine what height to fix him. (it changes dynamically when you re-size the window)

without a fixed height, the scroll wont appear, because the div will just grow large instead..

notice that this part can be done without script, if you fix the header height and use CSS3 (as shown in the end of the answer)now it's just a matter of moving the header along with the body each time we scroll.

this is done by a function assigned to the scroll event.CSS (some of it was copied from your style)JQueryIf you don't care about fixing the header height (I saw that you fixed the cell's height in your CSS), some of the Script can be skiped if you use CSS3 :Shorter Fiddle (this will not work on IE8)Here's a solution which again is not a CSS only solution. It is similar to avrahamcool's solution in that it uses a few lines of jQuery, but instead of changing heights and moving the header along, all it does is changing the width of tbody based on how far its parent table is scrolled along to the right.An added bonus with this solution is that it works with a semantically valid HTML table.It works great on all recent browser versions (IE10, Chrome, FF) and that's it, the scrolling functionality breaks on older versions. But then the fact that you are using a semantically valid HTML table will save the day and ensure the table is still displayed properly, it's only the scrolling functionality that won't work on older browsers.Here's a jsFiddle for demonstration purposes.CSSJSI needed a version which degrades nicely in IE9 (no scrolling, just a normal table). Posting the fiddle here as it is an improved version. All you need to do is set a height on the tr.Additional CSS to make this solution degrade nicely in IE9Here's a jsFiddle demonstrating the nicely degrading in IE9 version of this solution.Edit: Updated fiddle links to link to a version of the fiddle which contains fixes for issues mentioned in the comments. Just adding a snippet with the latest and greatest version while I'm at it:Here is a HTML / CSS only solution (with a little javascript).Apology to answer the question after this long, but the solution given did not suit me and I found a better one. Here is the easiest way to do it with HTML (no jquery):Before that, the solution fiddle to the question. https://jsfiddle.net/3vzrunkt/And to explain the solution:working example in jsFiddleThis can be achieved using div. It can be done with table too. But i always prefer div.Javascript:

I found a solution that will work for me that includes:...but there are a couple of caveats:Instead of posting my code here, I'll post a link to the jsFiddle.Fixed header table + scroll left/right.you can use following CSS code..The solution is to use JS to horizontally scroll the top div so that it matches the bottom div.You must be very careful to make sure the top and bottom are exactly the same sizes, for example you might need to make the TD and TH use fixed widths.Here is a fiddle  https://jsfiddle.net/jdhenckel/yzjhk08h/5/The important parts: CSS useNotice overflow-y must be the same on both head and lower.And the Javascript...There's a jquery plugin for this: jquery.floatThead If this is what you want only HTML and CSS solutionfiddleHere's the HTML And this is the cssLet me know if this is what you need.

Changing any item on a sublist will give the correct numbers for that list, but cause the parent lists to incorrectly count all child li elements in numbering.I feel like this is an ugly hack, but it works:only does the immediate children. So, for example, to do only the top level list elements you could use:Note: this isn't supported on IE6.The common workaround for backwards compatibility is to do something like this:It's more tedious because you have to apply styles and then turn them off (and you may not necessarily know what the old values are) but it's the only IE6-friendly pure CSS workaround there is.Edit: Ok you have a MooTools specific issue. getElements() returns all descendants, not just immediate children. Try using getChildren().or something like that.The original question was not answered. :only-child only works if the only-child has no descendant children. The original post suggested that the inclusion of descendant children was due to ul>li whereas it is in fact due to a bug in :only-child. Paradoxically :first-child selects the first child in a list with descendant children, as does last-child, but :only-child does not. I checked this in Firefox, Opera and Chrome. Here is an example:To activate :first-child and :last-child rules uncomment the last two items. The implementation of the Selectors Level 3 standard is thus inconsistent in major browsers. The :first-child rule should not be activated when there is an :only-child rule and a unique child has descendants. In the example the only-child should be red but it is green.

White nor black or any gray-scale is technically an actual color - you can't saturate or rotate it. You'll have to "colorize" it somehow, and the sepia filter is the only filter which do some form of colorizing.It would be easier if your image was pure 100% red. Then you could just add the target degree directly and adjust saturation and lightness using HSL for target. For a white color start point the first step is to convert and define an intermediate color so we can saturate and rotate it later on.Lets first darken the white image and apply sepia to get a "base" color we can work with:This will produce RGB color value of approximately:Step two is to convert that to HSL color-space which gives us:These two first steps are static and its result will be reused every time we need to find a target adjustment (the actual value of sepia is defined in the SVG Filters specification).Now we need to calculate what we need to apply to this base color to get target color. First convert target color, for example #689d94 as given in the question, to HSL:Then we have to calculate the difference between those. Hue is calculated by simply subtracting base from target. The same for Saturation and Lightness, but as we assume 100% of the base value we need to subtract the result from 100% to end up with a diff for the accumulated values:Convert those values to a filter-string by appending it to the existing filter, then set it on the div:And to set it you would probably do something like this assuming filter and divElement are already declared:Note that there is likely rounding errors as RGB is represented as integer, while HSL is floating point, so the actual result may not be exact, but it should get pretty close.Viable alternative options are:The accepted answer is wrong. Hue-rotate does not conserve saturation or brightness and you have to do crazy math to come up with the correct values. The far easier way - which will result in a correct result - is to do a CSS filter that references an SVG filter. The feColorMatrix primitive in SVG filters allows you to pick a color directly - like so. Take your color #424242 - divide each color's hex value by #FF (.257) and put them in the fifth column, first three rows of your color matrix. Like so:If svg are being used then ...You can open svg files with some text editor copy and paste to html file then change path color as required.In below example code... I just changed the path color of center ring.

While developing for multiple sets of browsers, what issues have you faced while development due to differences in browser implementation?To start with I am listing some of those which i faced:Most of the problems I have are with IE, specifically IE6.  Problems I personally deal with that have left a memorable impression (in no particular order):I will probably add more to this list later, since (to me) the worst part of web development are cross-browser issues.  Also, I doubt I'll ever edit out the "I will probably add more to this list later", since these problems are endless.  :)The only one that really gets to me:If you're interested in the issues themselves, QuirksMode.org is an amazing resource I used every day before making the leap to client-side libraries. Also check out John Resig's The DOM is a Mess presentation at yahoo, which gives a lot of theory about how to deal with cross-browser topics efficiently. However, if you're interested in simply having them solved, your question is an excellent example of why many consider using client-side libraries like jQuery, YahooUI, MooTools, Dojo, etc. With a thriving community, talented people and corporate backing projects like those allow you to focus on your app rather than these issues.Here are some jQuery examples that avoid much of the cross-browser frustration and can really make all of this.. fun.Cross-browser mouse click bindingCross-browser HTML InjectionCross-browser Ajax (all request objects are  still made available to you)And what really blows me away, load a data subset with selectors (see manual for details)Now, how all this really starts to get fun: chaining methods togetherReminds me of Joel's Can Your Programming Language Do This? article.Taking all this to a theoretical level, true advancement doesn't come from what you can do with conscious thought and effort, but rather what you can do automatically (without thought or effort). Joel has a segment on this in Smart And Gets Things Done regarding interviewing questions and smart developers, completely changed my approach to programming.Similar to a pianist who can just 'play' the music because she knows all the keys, your advancement comes not from doing more things that require thought but rather more things that require no thought. The goal then becomes making all the basics easy.. natural.. subconscious.. so we can all geek out on our higher level goals.Client side libraries, in a way, help us do just that. ;)IE6? Meh. You guys have got it easy! You've never had to make CSS layout work in Netscape 4 (without crashing the entire browser)? You've never had to write for appliance browsers that don't support tables? You've never had to write for IE Mobile?And this is the most up-to-date release of Microsoft's flagship Windows Mobile browser in 2009.Sure, it supports XMLHttpRequest, but writing AJAX code on a browser whose CSS and script support is less than IE3 (!) is bizarrely schizophrenic, like you're working with a weird amalgam of 21st-century and 19th-century technologies.I wouldn't recommend it.Been doing this too long to have many problems, but it still drives me nuts that I have to hack around IE's non-support for CSS things like display:table, :last-child, and :hover outside of anchors. All the IE stuff is still insane, but it's just background insanity now :)Biggest Cross-Browser Issue? - Internet Explorer!<start_grumpy>IE is solely responsible for "holding back the web" - us developers can't create amazing sites using HTML5, or SVG, or XFORMS, or CANVAS... not because of Firefox,Safari or Chrome, but because 2/3s of the Internet is still stuck on IE. Not to mention that ~20% of the web is still stuck on IE6!  IE8 is the first version of IE to at least try to be standards compatible (2001's standards that is), which means it will be at least 2018 before we can finally start dropping all support for IE7.</start_grumpy>Otherwise name a DOM method that IE fully supports... the fact that this is a hard question to answer is my biggest CrossBrowser issue.even things IE invented are messed up...While developing a system tests framework for a web app we had to simulate various events such as clicks. I remember that we couldn't find any normal way to do it in IE and FF and had to implement it in two different ways with a lot of voodoo around.I don't remember the specifics, but I remember that it was really annoying.This, basically.Modern javascript frameworks (jQuery, prototype, etc) have done wonders for getting code working in lots of browsers at once.The biggest problem I have now is the fact that any sort of rich UI behaviour runs amazingly slowly. IE7 is bad. IE6 is worse. IE8 is buggy, half finished, and really no better than IE7.The worst thing is that I don't think we'll ever be free of IE6.  It was so ubiquitous, and so damn quirky. Loads of 'enterprise' (and by that I mean big web apps made by one big company for another big company) applications used highly specific IE6 javascript that doesn't even work in IE7, never mind anything else.Companies can't afford to completely replace these apps - we're trying to sell them new ones and that means IE6 support is mandatory. The way it is right now, with credit-crunched companies cutting costs, I reckon we'll still be supporting IE6 in 2015 :-(In internet explorer (note: older versions of IE, not necessarily versions 9/10+), if you create form elements using document.createElement, the field won't be submitted with the form.  The only workaround is to use In IE, you can not hide select option elements, only the select element itself.  This makes it difficult to dynamically change the contents of select options using Javascript.This problem also exists in Safari and Chrome.There are many other issues with IE, but this one has caused me the most frustration recently.IE's restrictions on using DOM manipulations on tables forced me to take a completely different approach to something. Very frustrating at the start, but the positive out of it was that the second approach was ultimately better, so I suppose I should be grateful to IE. ;)Actually all of those are W3C DOM methods supported by the vast majority of browsers. I think you'll find they also work in IE.My biggest cross-browser issue is that there are people out there still using IE.Second biggest is that even in standards-following browsers, doing some things in CSS is still impossible; for instance tbody {overflow:auto} does nothing useful in anything but Gecko, and even there it has bugs.Firefox and IE ahve different table setups in the DOM, in one, all siblings of a cell are the other cells, whilst the other has elements between the cells.  I can't remember which way around it is, but it gave me a real headache in one application.My biggest problem are browser makers. Arrogant little *^&%s. I mean, you can't sell a browser to anybody, yet everyone is in their little corner trying to out do each other, only creating division. Oh and Chrome. Chrome still doesn't know what it wants to be, Safari or Firefox. Aside from its one parlor trick, its practically useless. I blame all you guys who kept googling just because you hate monopolies. Guess what, they're the monopoly now. Now we can all enjoy second rate, prematurely launched software.This mostly stems from a bug* I had in Chrome today, it never dawned on me to query the browser. Both Safari and Chrome were failing so I figured hey, once I fixed the Safari problem Chrome would be fixed automatically, but oh no no. Mr."I run tabs in seperate processes" AKA "Sr. No full screen" just had to hold me in the lizard lock with its mind boggling implementation.I also detest Firefox. I can't tell whether I have a virus infestation or Firebug running. Now until Adobe decides to release a browser that makes Flash practical for things other than movie clips I'm pretty much going to have something to bitch about for a long time. And we all know that's what life is all about.Also, I only enjoy programming when I encounter ridiculous bugs that make my brain juices run. Inconsistencies in the CSS box model when dealing with forms. In particular it's irritating how each browser handles the <select> Boxmy only nightmare is IE6 you should always look for hacks but everytime you face a problem with it there is someone who ran into it before you and blogged about it (and we will never get away from it )I was working on CSS layout written by someone who thought that the size given to an element is size+padding+border like in IE5 and not only the content box as explained in official specification. It was written only a few month ago so he did dirty hacks to make it look well in IE7. It took me several hours with FireBug to track down the source of the problem and by the time I realized it I was really annoyed.If you open site with "floating" CSS written for IE5 in Firefox the boxes just do not have enough space to fit and fall down the page. If you open it in IE7 it looks nice as IE7 lets the borders overlap so it looks almost correct. For someone as inexperienced as me it was hard to note.To remove iframe borders in Internet Explorer you have to specify the frameborder attribute as camelCase format, which is non xhtml compliant.An easy way to help with the pesky IE display issues is to use firebug, Yep enen in IE 6/7/8 Just use Firebug LiteIf you add the following as a bookmark and stick it on your tool bar it will enable firebug lite off any webpage with a single click. (only check this in IE and it works fine.)

Add CSS to <head> with JavaScript?

Is there a way to add css from a string in the javascript file to the head of a document with javascript?Let's say we have a webpage, which has a lightbox script, this script requires a css file to function. Now adding this css file with <link> will make the css file download even for people that don't have js enabled. I know that I can dynamically load the css file with the script, but that also means that there will be 2 http requests, and in cases where there is little to no css in the file I find this inefficient. So I thought to myself, what if you could put the css that you have in the css file, into the script, have the script parse the css and add it into the head, or even better just have the script add the css directly into the <head> of the document.

 injecting a string of CSS into a page it is easier to do this with the <link> element than the <style> element.The following adds p { color: green; } rule to the page.You can create this in JavaScript simply by URL encoding your string of CSS and adding it the HREF attribute. Much simpler than all the quirks of <style> elements or directly accessing stylesheets.This will work in IE 5.5 upwardsThe solution you have marked will work but this solution requires fewer dom operations and only a single element.Edit: As Atspulgs comment suggest, you can achieve the same without jQuery using the querySelector:Older answer below.You could use the jQuery library to select your head element and append HTML to it, in a manner like:You can find a complete tutorial for this problem hereIf you don't want to rely on a javascript library, you can use document.write() to spit out the required css, wrapped in style tags, straight into the document head:This way you avoid firing an extra HTTP request.There are other solutions that have been suggested / added / removed, but I don't see any point in overcomplicating something that already works fine cross-browser. Good luck!http://jsbin.com/oqede3/editA simple non-jQuery solution, albeit with a bit of a hack for IE:It seems IE does not allow setting innerText, innerHTML or using appendChild on style elements. Here is a bug report which demonstrates this, although I think it identifies the problem incorrectly. The workaround above is from the comments on the bug report and has been tested in IE6 and IE9.Whether you use this, document.write or a more complex solution will really depend on your situation.Here's a function that will dynamically create a CSS rule in all major browsers.  createCssRule takes a selector (e.g. "p.purpleText"), a rule (e.g. "color: purple;") and optionally a Document (the current document is used by default):Here's a simple way.

Are there any cons to using color names in place of color codes in CSS?

For example writing red is more efficient than #cc0000. It has less characters, takes up less space, and is easier to remember.Are there any down sides to using color names over hex codes or RGB values? This includes programming in a multi-developer environment.

For example writing red is more efficient than #cc0000. It has less characters, takes up less space, and is easier to remember.Are there any down sides to using color names over hex codes or RGB values? This includes programming in a multi-developer environment.Different browsers may not agree on what some color names mean. There are not names for all 16 million 24-bit colors. In fact there are only 17 W3C-standard color names. It's probably OK to use those.Personally I use a templating system at build time to pre-process my CSS files, so that I can keep a standard set of site colors and refer to them by name. That way I get the best of both worlds: I know exactly what my RGB color values are, but I can use simpler names in the CSS.(Of course, it's still not possible to know exactly how a color will look on a given user's browser.)edit — in the 5 years since this answer was written, preprocessors like Less and Sass have become pretty common. Those provide some very sophisticated tools for managing colors (and many other things) in CSS sources.I recommend that you follow the W3C recommendations:All of them (CSS Level 1, Level 2 and Level 3) indicate that using color names is perfectly acceptable, but which ones are acceptible varies depending on the specification.CSS1 Specification recommends to use color names as a valid substitute to hex codes and RGB codes.You can use the color name orange now! The count is up to 17 colors. CSS2 Specification for reference.CSS3 allows for SVG 1.0's X11 colors to be used for CSS's properties (as well as hsl() values). This expands the amount of color names to 147 colors. Any of these color names can be used in any browser that supports the SVG 1.0 specification, which is IE9 or newer.This also means that the list of colors provided in the question are mostly not valid.If you're seeking to support legacy browsers stick to the web safe original 16 color names since X11 colors are not supported. Otherwise, you are free to use any of the 147 color names specified in the X11 spec.All browsers should abide by the specification in reference to the equivalent hex codes. The time it takes the parser to read the color names is virtually, if not exactly, the same as using a hex value, an rgb value, or an hsl() value.To me, it's more readable to write your HEX codes in lowercase. For example, #8b88b6 is obviously more readable than #8B88B6. Also, I tend to use shorthand HEX color instead of full code (#666 instead of #666666) since it's more efficient.personally, i prefer using hexcodes because of 2 reasonsThis assumes you're using colors other that the simple red, black, white etc. In a multi-developer environment, i'd say hexcodes are better because they're more universally consistent (every developer knows exactly what the color is).The previous answers look outdated by now. If you develop for browsers that support CSS3, which are all major browsers since IE9, you can use color names in CSS. In HTML, only the 16 original web colors are supported.The question was if there are downsides. I think there are a few:Sources:

https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/color_value and

http://caniuse.com/#search=css3%20colorsI prefer a further optimization, #c00 for red.  If you are going to use a primary color, or any color that is similar to #aabbcc, you can use shorthand, #abc.I use color names for prototyping, debugging, and to set up really basic, monochromatic color schemes which are then ripe for theming with hyper-specific hex colors. It makes a theme-able property easy to spot. It's also more human readable; less brain strain when trying to instantly visualize what's going on....then in theming file...It really comes down to your coding style.  I stick to hex values for consistency - a color is always formatted as #000 or #000000, and I don't have to worry about switching between namd and unnamed colors.In the end, it's a decision you and your team will have to make on your own.  It's all about your preferences.Personally, I prefer all colours in a CSS file to be defined in the same way, if possible.That way I don’t have to think in a different way when I see different colours defined (e.g. red, #cd876f and rgba(255,255,0,0.4)).I also prefer colour notations that match what I’ll see when identifying the colour in the design I’m implementing. Photoshop’s colour palette gives RGB and hex values, amongst others, but doesn’t give CSS colour names. (Other design tools might do though.)I think color names are more descriptive... And this is a good reason for using it when possible.in my opinion it's a matter of preference.  if the color is as simple as red, black, grey, blue, white etc.  ill use the word instead of the hex.

I want to make header of my table fixed.Table is present inside the scrollable div.Please see my code here:    http://jsfiddle.net/w7Mm8/114/ kindly suggest me the solution to this.ThanksMy Code:What you want to do is separate the content of the table from the header of the table.

You want only the <th> elements to be scrolled.

You can easily define this separation in HTML with the <tbody> and the <thead> elements. 

Now the header and the body of the table are still connected to each other, they will still have the same width (and same scroll properties). Now to let them not 'work' as a table anymore you can set the display: block. This way <thead> and <tbody> are separated.Now you can set the scroll to the body of the table:And last, because the <thead> doesn't share the same width as the body anymore, you should set a static width to the header of the table:You should also set a static width for <td>. This solves the issue of the unaligned columns.I hope this is what you meant.jsFiddleAddendum If you would like to have more control over the column widths, have them to vary in width between each other, and course keep the header and body columns aligned, you can use the following example:I can think of a cheeky way to do it, I don't think this will be the best option but it will work.Create the header as a separate table then place the other in a div and set a max size, then allow the scroll to come in by using overflow.

Visual Studio 2013 is awesome, now with syntax highlight and autocomplete for .less files. But does it also generate the respective CSS files? Do I need to install other extensions for that?Yes, Visual Studio 2013 doesn't come with a LESS compiler built-in so you'll need to bring your own. You can either use an external compiler, or install an extension so you can compile your LESS files from within the IDE.If you don't want to install plugins in your Visual Studio, you can use an external compiler.Currently I'm using Koala, every time you save your LESS file he will compile it automatically in your output folder. Take a look at the official LESS page about GUI Compilers.I had trouble compiling Bootstrap LESS (after installing the Twitter.Bootstrap.Less NuGet).The trick with WebEssentials is to cause the bootstrap.less file to need saving (typing a space, then pressing delete is sufficient), then saving it. The corresponding .css, .min.css and css.map files are automatically generated and appear nested under the .less file in Solution Explorer.Easy:Afterwards the resulting .css file will be generated on every file save.Another small tool to compile LESS after it has been saved is WinLess.Not much options but small and simple. And it does the job!http://www.winless.org/Don't know what the experience of other users is, but WebEssentials 2013 does not work well on my machine with Visual Studio 2013 (Ultimate) and the settings, well... No UI and can't turn features completely off which i don't want to use.You can also use Chirpy which allows editing of many modern web technologies that MS missed.http://chirpy.codeplex.com/

CSS-Only Scrollable Table with fixed headers

I have a solution by which I can create scrollable tables w/fixed header/footer using minor jQuery and CSS - but I am looking for a way to make this a CSS-only solution that is cross-browser compliant.To be clear, what I am seeking to do is use only a table tag (and it's valid sub-tags, colgroup, col, thead, tbody, tfoot, tr, th, td), but adopt a set of CSS rules which will meet the following conditions:This code example: http://jsfiddle.net/TroyAlford/SNKfd/ shows my current approach. Most of the JS is just to populate the table with random values, but the last portion is what drives the left/right scrollability.NOTE: The example provided does not render properly in IE, and requires jQuery to provide the horizontal scrolling. I don't care about horizontal scrolling anyway, so it's fine if a solution doesn't do that.

I don't care about horizontal scrolling anyway, so it's fine if a solution doesn't do that.This answer will be used as a placeholder for the not fully supported position: sticky and will be updated over time. It is currently advised to not use the native implementation of this in a production environment.See this for the current support: https://caniuse.com/#feat=css-stickyAn alternative answer would be using position: sticky. As described by W3C:This described exactly the behavior of a relative static header. It would be easy to assign this to the <thead> or the first <tr> HTML-tag, as this should be supported according to W3C. However, both Chrome, IE and Edge have problems assigning a sticky position property to these tags. There also seems to be no priority in solving this at the moment.What does seem to work for a table element is assigning the sticky property to a table-cell. In this case the <th> cells.Because a table is not a block-element that respects the static size you assign to it, it is best to use a wrapper element to define the scroll-overflow.In this example I use a simple <div> wrapper to define the scroll-overflow done with a static height of 150px. This can of course be any size. Now that the scrolling box has been defined, the sticky <th> elements will corespondent "to the nearest ancestor with a scrolling box", which is the div-wrapper.Non-supported devices can make use of a polyfill, which implements the behavior through code. An example is stickybits, which resembles the same behavior as the browser's implemented position: sticky.Example with polyfill: http://jsfiddle.net/7UZA4/6957/Surprised a solution using flexbox hasn't been posted yet.Here's my solution using display: flex and a basic use of :after (thanks to Luggage) to maintain the alignment even with the scrollbar padding the tbody a bit. This has been verified in Chrome 45, Firefox 39, and MS Edge. It can be modified with prefixed properties to work in IE11, and further in IE10 with a CSS hack and the 2012 flexbox syntax.Note the table width can be modified; this even works at 100% width.The only caveat is that all table cells must have the same width. Below is a clearly contrived example, but this works fine when cell contents vary (table cells all have the same width and word wrapping on, forcing flexbox to keep them the same width regardless of content). Here is an example where cell contents are different.Just apply the .scroll class to a table you want scrollable, and make sure it has a thead:As far as I know, there is no standard way to achieve this with only CSS, although I think there should be. Mozilla browsers used to support fixed headers with a scrolling body, but they've removed it in the last few years.After researching this a bit, including finding this posting, a friend just developed this solution for me; it uses Javascript but no canned libraries, and the only requirement for the HTML markup is that the table have an id name. Then, at window.onload, to call one Javascript function for each table giving the id, height, and width. If Javascript is disabled at the browser, the whole table is displayed according to its original markup. If Javascript is enabled, the table is fit into the specified height and width, and tbody scrolls, and if thead and tfoot exist, they are fixed at top and bottom.Inspired by @Purag's answer, here's another flexbox solution:Ive achieved this easily using this code :So you have a structure like this :just style the thead with :Three things to consider : First, this property is new. It’s not supported at all, apart from the beta builds of Webkit-based browsers. So caveat formator. Again, if you really want for your users to benefit from sticky headers, go with a javascript implementation.Second, if you do use it, you’ll need to incorporate vendor prefixes. Perhaps position: sticky will work one day. For now, though, you need to use position:-webkit-sticky (and the others; check the block of css further up in this post).Third, there aren’t any positioning defaults at the moment, so you need to at least include top: 0; in the same css declaration as the position:-webkit-sticky. Otherwise, it’ll just scroll off-screen.If you have the option of giving a fixed width to the table cells (and a fixed height to the header), you can used the position: fixed option:http://jsfiddle.net/thundercracker/ZxPeh/23/You would just have to stick it in an iframe. You could also have horizontal scrolling by giving the iframe a scrollbar (I think).Edit 2015If you can live with a pre-defining the width of your table cells (by percentage), then here's a bit more elegant (CSS-only) solution:http://jsfiddle.net/7UBMD/77/Only with CSS : CSS:Bootply : http://www.bootply.com/AgI8LpDuglI see this thread has been inactive for a while, but this topic interested me and now with some CSS3 selectors, this just became easier (and pretty doable with only CSS). This solution relies on having a max height of the table container. But it is supported as long as you can use the :first-child selector.Fiddle here.If anyone can improve on this answer, please do! I plan on using this solution in a commercial app soon!HTMLCSSI had the same problem and after spending 2 days researching I found this solution from Ksesocss that fits for me and maybe is good for you too. It allows fixed header and dynamic width and only uses CSS. The only problem is that the source is in spanish but you can find the html and css code there.This is the link:http://ksesocss.blogspot.com/2014/10/responsive-table-encabezado-fijo-scroll.htmlI hope this helpsif it gets rock hard where all the mentioned solutions don't work (as it got for me), try a two-tabled solutioned, as I explained in this answerhttps://stackoverflow.com/a/47722456/6488361As I was recently in need of this, I will share a solution that uses 3 tables, but does not require JavaScript.Table 1 (parent) contains two rows. The first row contains table 2 (child 1) for the column headers. The second row contains table 3 (child 2) for the scrolling content.It must be noted the childTbl must be 25px shorter than the parentTbl for the scroller to appear properly.This is the source, where I got the idea from. I made it HTML5-friendly without the deprecated tags and the inline CSS.This is reliable on different browsers, the downside would be having to hard code the table widths.I was trying to figure this out myself recently, and I came up with a good solution that works perfectly in my browser (Chrome 51) and supports dynamic column widths. I should mention that after I independently derived my answer I also found a similar technique described elsewhere on the web...The trick is to use two identical tables positioned on top of one another. The lower table is visible and the upper table is invisible expect for the header. The upper table also has pointer-events: none set on the tbody so mouse interactions hit the underneath table. This way the lower table scrolls under the upper table's header.For everything to layout and resize properly (when the user adjusts screen width for instance), both tables need to have the same scrollbar behavior. However, the upper table's scroll bar is ignored thanks to the pointer-events: none and can be made invisible with: Here is the complete code:Caveats: More work is required to prove this works in other browsers. Also I was rather liberal in mixing inline and stylesheet styles. However I believe the general concept is the best way of doing this since if the target browser supports it. The only functionality/display issues are that if you want a horizontal scroll bar, the vertical scroll bar can get scrolled out of view (as shown in the snippet). You can still scroll with the mouse wheel though. Additionally you can't have a transparent background on the header (otherwise the underneath table would show through). Finally you need a way to generate two identical tables. Personally I am using react.js and it is easy to do it with react, but php or other server-side generation or javascript will also work.Another implementation but without any overflow on tbody and dynamic columns. Requires JavaScript though. A container div is used to house the column headings. When the table is scrolled past the view port, a fixed header appears at the top. If table is scrolled horizontally, the fixed header scrolls as well.Column headings are created using span elements with display: inline-block and a negative margin is used to scroll header horizontally. Also optimized using RequestAnimationFrame to avoid any jank.https://codepen.io/lloydleo/pen/NRpqEE

CSS Selector for selecting an element that comes BEFORE another element? [duplicate]

I know JavaScript could be used to easily do this, but I'd like to use a purely CSS-based solution if possible, I just can't figure out a way to do it.It would be possible to use the 'adjacent sibling selector' if the input was before the label.  Just put the input before the label, and then modify the layout to put label before the input.  Here's an example:(It's kind of a hack, I would personally use javascript to do this)The CSS Selectors 4 Spec provides a syntax for defining the "subject" of a selector by using a !. As of early-2016, this is not available in any browser. I'm including this because it will be the correct way to do this using pure CSS once browsers implement this syntax.Given the markup in the questionThis CSS would do the trick.Of course, this assumes browsers actually implement the subject selector and that there are no bugs related to how this syntax works with the :focus pseudo-class.There's no selector that will give you the previous element using CSS..You will need to use javascript to handle what you're after.Use this selector:this will select the label that has the value 'username' in the attribute 'for'Floating the input element to the right, achieves correct element order without changing order of "Username" and ":" in the label text that you get with direction:rtl.

I'm trying to style a disabled input. I can use:orIs the attribute selector the modern CSS3 way and the way to go forward? I used to use the pseudo-class, but I can't find any info on whether they are the old way and won't be supported or whether they're both equal and you can use whatever you like best.I have no need to support older browsers (it's an intranet application), so is it:No; actually, attribute selectors have been around since CSS2, and the disabled attribute itself has existed since HTML 4. As far as I know, the :disabled pseudo-class was introduced in Selectors 3, which makes the pseudo-class newer.Yes, to some extent.With an attribute selector, you're relying on the knowledge that the document you're styling makes use of a disabled attribute to indicate disabled fields. Theoretically, if you were styling something that wasn't HTML, disabled fields might not be represented using a disabled attribute, e.g. it might be enabled="false" or something like that. Even future editions of HTML could introduce new elements that make use of different attributes to represent enabled/disabled state; those elements wouldn't match the [disabled] attribute selector.The :disabled pseudo-class decouples the selector from the document you're working with. The spec simply states that it targets elements that are disabled, and that whether an element is enabled, disabled, or neither, is defined by the document language instead:In other words, when you use the pseudo-class, the UA automatically figures out which elements to match based on the document you're styling, so you don't have to tell it how.In terms of the DOM, I believe setting the disabled property on a DOM element also modifies the HTML element's disabled attribute, which means there's no difference between either selector with DOM manipulation. I'm not sure if this is browser-dependent, but here's a fiddle that demonstrates it in the latest versions of all major browsers:You're most likely going to be styling HTML, so none of this may make any difference to you, but if browser compatibility isn't an issue I would choose :enabled and :disabled over :not([disabled]) and [disabled] simply because the pseudo-classes carry semantics that the attribute selector does not. I'm a purist like that.It turns out that Internet Explorer 10 and 11 fail to recognize the :disabled pseudoclass on some elements and only works fine with the attribute selector syntax.The code snipped above renders in IE like this:As long as you're only styling input elements, you should be fine either way. Still it's a good advice to test the final result in all browsers you wish to support.

2017-10-30 21:12:33Z

I'm trying to style an element placed by the router outlet in angular and want to make sure that the element generated gets a width of 100%From most of the replies, I'm seeing that I should use the ::ng-deep selector, but from Angular's docs it is being deprecated. Is there an alternative to ::ng-deep?FWIW In my research I have not found any replacement for ng-deep or the other applicable alternatives. This is because, I believe, the Angular team is deferring to the W3C spec on the shadow dom, which initially had selectors such as deep. However, the W3c has since removed the recommendation, but not replaced it with a new one. Until that happens, I imagine that the Angular team will keep ::ng-deep and it's alternatives available, but in deprecated state due to the pending state of W3C's drafts. I am not able to take the time to find the documentation to back this up right now but I did see it recently.Long story short: Keep using ::ng-deep and its alternatives until a replacement is created - the deprecation is just an early notice so that people aren't blindsided whenever the actual change materializes.-- UPDATE --https://drafts.csswg.org/css-scoping-1/

Here is the draft proposal if you're interested. It appears that they are working on a robust set of selectors for elements within a shadow dom tree; it is this spec, once approved, that I think will inform the angular clone, if there even is one (i.e. angular may not need to implement their own selectors once this goes live in browsers).To bypass the deprecated ::ng-deep, I usually disable ViewEncapsulation. Although this is not the best approach, it has served me well.To disable ViewEncapsulation, do the following in your component:This will make the .scss styles in this component global to the whole application. To not allow the styles to go up the chain to parent and sibling components, wrap the whole scss with the selector like so:Now, the styles specified here will go down to children components so you have to be extra specific with your css selectors and mind your p's and q's when adding CSS (maybe add the child selector specified in your Angular app and then its styles).I say it is not the best approach because of the paragraph above, but this has served me well.The simple and easy alternative to a deep style is a common style using the element selector of the parent component.  So if you had this in hero-details.component.css:It would become this in styles.css:Basically a deep style is an un-encapsulated style so it conceptually seems more like a common style to me than a component style.  Personally I would not use deep styles anymore.   Breaking changes are normal in major version updates and deprecated feature removal is fair game.This is not a general replacement for ::ng-deep, but for the use case described by the question author:In the special case where you want to style the element inserted by a router-outlet, there is an elegant solution using the adjacent neighbor selector in CSS:This will apply to all elements which are direct neighbors of a router-outlet.Further reading:

https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Adjacent_sibling_combinator

https://angular.io/guide/router#router-outletAs someone stated before, if you're using a third party library it's virtually impossible to avoid having to use ::ng-deep once in a while. But what are you going to do about your previous projects when the ::ng-deep became no longer supported by browsers?To be ready for that moment I will suggest the following:To avoid changing the default encapsulation, I wrote a helper that append global styles for the component:deepStyle.tsmy-component.tsresult:

I have 6 more years experience of dealing with button now, and browsers have somewhat moved on from IE6 and IE7.  So I'll add an answer that details what I found out and what I suggest.Answering from an ASP.NET perspective.I was excited when I found this question and some code for a ModernButton control, which, in the end, is a <button> control.So I started adding all sorts of these buttons, decorated with <img /> tags inside of them to make them stand out.  And it all worked great... in Firefox, and Chrome.Then I tried IE6 and got the "a potentially dangerous Request.Form value was detected", because IE6 submits the html inside of the button, which, in my case, has html tags in it.  I don't want to disable the validateRequest flag, because I like this added bit of data validation.So then I wrote some javascript to disable that button before the submit occurred.  Worked great in a test page, with one button, but when I tried it out on a real page, that had other <button> tags, it blew up again.  Because IE6 submits ALL of the buttons' html.  So now I have all sorts of code to disable buttons before submit.Same problems with IE7.  IE8 thankfully has this fixed.Yikes.  I'd recommend not going down this road IF you are using ASP.NET.Update:I found a library out there that looks promising to fix this.If you use the ie8.js script from this library: http://code.google.com/p/ie7-js/It might work out just fine.  The IE8.js brings IE5-7 up to speed with IE8 with the button tag. It makes the submitted value the real value and only one button gets submitted.When using <button> always specify the type, since browsers default to different types.This will work consistently across all browser:This way you gain all of <button>'s goodness, no downsides.Everything you need to know: W3Schools <button> TagPros:Cons:From https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/button:An important quirk to be aware of: In a form that contains a <button/> element, IE6 and IE7 will not submit the form when the <button/> element is clicked. Other browsers, on the other hand, will submit the form.In contrast, no browsers will submit the form when <input type="button"/> or <button type="button"/> elements are clicked. And naturally, all browsers will submit the form when <input type="submit"/> or <button type="submit"/> elements are clicked.As @orip's answer says, to get consistent submit behavior across browsers, always use <button type="button" /> or <button type="submit" /> inside a <form/> element. Never leave out the type attribute.I've had some experience with the quirks of <button> now, 6 years later, so here are my suggestions:Note that: Using a button-mimic class, like Bootstrap's .btn allows you to just make things like <div> or <a> or even <button> look exactly the way you want it to, and in the case of <a> have a more useful fallback behavior.  Not a bad option.Is it broken or not:As usual, the answer is "it works fine in all major browsers, but has the following quirks in IE." I don't think it will be a problem for you though.The <button> tag is supported by all the major browsers. The only support problem lies in what Internet Explorer will submit upon pressing a button.The major browsers will submit the content of the value attribute. Internet exploter will submit the text between the <button> and </button> tags, while also submitting the value of every other one in the form, instead just the one you clicked.For your purposes, just cleaning up old HTML, this shouldn't be a problem.Sources:Here's a site that explains the differences:

http://www.javascriptkit.com/howto/button.shtmlBasically, the input tag allows just text (although you can use a background image) while the button allows you to add images, tables, divs and whatever else. Also, it doesn't require it to be nested within a form tag.You might also run into these problems:Another thing is related to styling it using the sliding-door technique: you need to insert another tag e.g. <span> to make it work.as far as I am concerned the difference between submit and button tags is this: 

 gives you the option to have different text displayed than the element's valueLet's say you have a list of products then next to each product you want a button to add it to the customer's cart:then you could do this:Now the problem is that IE will send the form with value="add to cart" instead of value="product2"The easiest way to workaroound this issue is by adding onclick="this.value='product2'"So this:will do the trick on all major browsers - I have actually used this on a form with multiple buttons and works with Chrome Firefox and IELooks like the main reason to use <button> is to allow for CSS markup of that button and the ability to style the button with images: (see here: http://www.javascriptkit.com/howto/button.shtml)However, I think the more adopted approach I've seen in (X)HTML + CSS is to use a div and style it completely with images and :hover pseudo-classes (simulating button downpress... can't add more than one link per answer, so just google "div button" you'll see lots of examples of this), and using javascript to do form submission or AJAX call... this also makes even more sense if you don't use HTML forms, and do all submissions with AJAX.

The property needed is:Which has solved my problem.  Yay!I don't know, the solutions here seem partially right, but then don't really work. Based on Josh Stodola's answer, here's a cross-browser solution tested in Firefox, Safari, Chrome and IE 7, 8 & 9CSS:Markup:To add IE6 support (sigh), add _height: [yourvalue] to the div. Yes, with an underscore.Test it yourself on JSFiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/atp4B/2/Hint: don't use DIVs for text blocks (for SEO and a better semantic purposes)Here's an example I made of exactly what your looking for:

(jsFiddled here: http://jsfiddle.net/yohphomu/)Warning: If I understand your question correctly, there is no need to set a height or width because their default setting is auto (that being said you can use auto), but the only problem with this is that if you wanted to change the background or put a border it will make it around more than the desired field. Why is that and how do we fix it, read on.Any one having this problem hasn't realized on thing (assuming you have this problem and are using div's) anything between div tags is considered (for understanding purposes) a complete set, meaning that in that div is all the things you want it to stand for (computers do what they're told, not what you want them to do) so (for example) in order to set the text-align to center it needs that whole lines space and (ultimately) if it had a border, it would border all the space it used. If you understand this read on, if not well can't help you there.So now that we understand what happens, how do we fix it? Well we need one part to center it, the other to color it. In my example I used a div to center it and span to color. Did I need the div? I'm am positive I did not. I could have achieved the same thing by using the p to center (or I could get rid of the p and just use div). The reason I did this was to keep it organized.Hope this answered your question. Took you 4 years for an answer but me, 30 mins to figure it out (and I've been studying CSS for a few days now).The Example:Then css would look like:Notice: I set the container with set width and height because I was working on a project at the same time and to simulate a full screen with text.Also note that I have made it so that that the text has a separate background color with a border. I did this to show its measurements are independent and rescale when needed.I recommend flexbox! See what's possible at this website, solved by flexbox.It's quite new but works in all the major modern browsers (IE10 uses -ms- prefix, IE11+, Firefox 31+, Chrome 31+, Safari 7+, ...) - see this chart.Basically, vertical and horizontal centering, complete with dynamic sizing, can be accomplished in 4 statements:Make sure this parent actually is 100% height. You may need to set body and html to 100% height too.My implementation of this can be seen at my own personal website, http://pgmann.cf.Something like this?HTMLCSS

Performance differences between visibility:hidden and display:none

Wolfgang Adamec

[Performance differences between visibility:hidden and display:none](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11757016/performance-differences-between-visibilityhidden-and-displaynone)

I want to simplify things in my jQuery Backbone.js web application. One such simplification is the behavior of my menu and dialog widgets.  Previously I created the div boxes of my menus at start and hid them using display: none; opacity:0;.   When I needed a menu, I changed its style to display:block then used the jQuery ui position utility to position the div box (since elements with display:none cannot be positioned) and when it was done, finally changed its style to opacity:1.  Now I want to just hide them with visibility:hidden, and when I need one, I use the position utility and then change the style to visibility:visible.  When I begin using this new approach, I will have around 10 div boxes throughout the web application session that are hidden but occupy space, in contrast to the previous div boxes hidden with display:none.  What are the implications of my new approach? Does it effect browser performance in any regard?

When I begin using this new approach, I will have around 10 div boxes throughout the web application session that are hidden but occupy space, in contrast to the previous div boxes hidden with display:none.  What are the implications of my new approach? Does it effect browser performance in any regard? I'm not aware of any performance difference between display:none and visibility:hidden - even if there is, for as little as 10 elements it will be completely negligible.  Your main concern should be, as you say, whether you want the elements to remain within the document flow, in which case visibility is a better option as it maintains the box model of the element.display:none; elements are not in the render tree all, so they will perform better at face value.I doubt you will have any real visible performance problems from this though. If you  need opacity: 0 or visibility: hidden because of their functionality, then just use them. If you don't need the functionality, then use display: none;If you are toggling between visible and invisible states via javascript then visibility:hidden should be the better performer. Seeing as it always takes up the same amount of space in both visible and hidden states it won't cause a reflow of the elements below it every time you make it appear of disappear. For display:none you are removing it from the flow of the document and then when you set it to display:block you are rerendering it and pushing everything below that element down, essentially laying all that stuff out again.But if you are doing something like toggling visible states on button presses then you really should be using what suits your needs rather than what performs better, as the performance differences are negligible in such cases. When you are animating with the dom at around 20 times per second THEN you can worry about the performance of visibility:hidden vs display:none.visibility: hidden does not cause a re-flow on the document, while display: none does. display: none: The HTML engine will completely ignore the element and its children. The engine will not ignore elements marked with visibility: hidden, it will do all the calculations to the element and its children, the exception is that the element will not be rendered to the viewport.If the values for position and dimensions properties are needed then visibility: hidden have to be used and you have to handle the white space in the viewport, usually by wrapping that element inside another one with 0 width and height and 'overflow: hidden'. display:none will remove the element from the document's normal flow and set the values for position/height/width to 0 on the element and its children. When the elements display property is changed to other value than none, it triggers a complete document re-flow, which can be a problem for big documents - and sometimes not-so-big documents being rendered on hardware with limited capabilities. display: none is the natural and logical solution to use when hiding elements on the viewport, visibility: hidden should be used as a fallback, where/when needed.EDIT:

As pointed by @Juan, display: none is the choice to go when what you need is to add many elements to the DOM tree. visibility: hidden will trigger a re-flow for each element added to the tree, while display: none will not. Well, the main performance difference between display: block and visibility: hidden is that if you have a list of, say, 100000 elements, the visibility: hidden won't save you from DOM hanging because it doesn't remove elements from DOM.

visibility: hidden acts like opacity: 0 + pointer-events: none. display: none acts like Element.remove().Live example: https://jsfiddle.net/u2dou58r/10/From personal experience having just tried both on a simple static page with a form located beneath a "hidden" button, visibility: hidden performs flawlessly whereas display: none causes clickable buttons to slightly jump upon clicking, as if it tries to show the hidden button for a millisecond. Well, visibility:none still uses the space of the div.

So you could maybe skip the positioning part because its place is already allocated (and by that get a better performance).But I somehow guess that you need your display:none approach to allocate space correctly when the "show" event is triggered.I think this could be somehow related to this question: CSS Properties: Display vs. VisibilityI'll just quote the interesting part:So there should be no real difference in regard to browser performance, because both versions are still in the DOM hierarchy. These properties only affect how an element is displayed in regards to the DOM.

I would like to avoid having to add class to contained elements as this is error prone or requires another containing div.Want to center an image? Very easy, Bootstrap comes with two classes, .center-block and text-center.Use the former in the case of your image being a BLOCK element, for example, adding img-responsive class to your img makes the img a block element. You should know this if you know how to navigate in the web console and see applied styles to an element. Don't want to use a class? No problem, here is the CSS bootstrap uses. You can make a custom class or write a CSS rule for the element to match the Bootstrap class. You can do this by adding a div i.e. centerBlock. And give this property in CSS to center the image or any content. Here is the code:

Can anyone please tell me how can I do all this?There are several things you need to take into account of which one or more might be relevant you your specific caseYou need to ensure that your CSS is loaded after the PrimeFaces one. You can achieve this by placing the <h:outputStylesheet> referencing your CSS file inside <h:body> instead of <h:head>:JSF will automatically relocate the stylesheet to the end of the generated HTML <head> and this will thus ensure that the stylesheet is loaded after the PrimeFaces' default styles. This way the selectors in your CSS file which are exactly the same as in PrimeFaces CSS file will get precedence over the PrimeFaces one.You'll probably also see suggestions to put it in <f:facet name="last"> of <h:head> which is understood by PrimeFaces-specific HeadRenderer, but this is unnecessarily clumsy and would break when you have your own HeadRenderer.You also need to ensure that your CSS selector is at least as specific as the PrimeFaces' default CSS selector on the particular element. You need to understand CSS Specificity and Cascading and Inheritance rules. For example, if PrimeFaces declares a style by default as followsand you declare it asand the particular element with class="ui-bar" happen to have a parent element with class="ui-foo", then the PrimeFaces' one will still get precedence because that's the most specific match! You can use the webbrowser developer tools to find the exact CSS selector. Rightclick the element in question in the webbrowser (IE9/Chrome/Firefox+Firebug) and choose Inspect Element to see it.If you need to override a style for only a specific instance of the component and not all instances of the same component, then add a custom styleClass and hook on that instead. It is another case where specificity is used/applied. For example: If a component does not support a styleClass and you are on jsf 2.2 or up, you can also use passtrough attributes and add a pt:class and have it end-up on the output.In case you fail to properly load the CSS file in order or to figure the right CSS selector, you'll probably grab the !important workaround. This is Plain Wrong. It's an ugly workaround and not a real solution. It only confuses your style rules and yourself more in long term. The !important should only be used in order to override the values hardcoded in HTML element's style attribute from a CSS stylesheet file on (which is in turn also a bad practice, but in some rare cases unfortunately unavoidable).you can create a new css file for example cssOverrides.cssand place all the overrides you want inside it, that way upgrading the primefaces version wont affect you , and in your h:head add something like that if it wont work try adding it to the h:bodyin order to check if its working try this simple example inside the css filethis will reduce the size of all primefaces components /textI'm using PrimeFaces 6.0. Here's some information I would have liked to have regarding this:If you use <h:outputStylesheet/>, it will work, but your CSS will not be loaded last even if it's last in the <h:head></h:head> tags (other CSS files will be included afterwards). A trick you can do which I learned from here is to place it inside <f:facet name="last"></f:facet>, which must go inside the body, like so:Then your CSS will be the last loaded. Note: you will still have to adhere to the specificity rules as BalusC outlined.I placed "MyCSS.css" in WebContent/resources/css/.More information on the resource loading order: http://www.mkyong.com/jsf2/primefaces/resource-ordering-in-primefacesThe style rules used by PrimeFaces can be quite complex. An element can receive its styling from multiple CSS rules. It's good to know you can use filtering in the DOM inspector's style tab to search on the property you want to customise:This screenshot was taken using Chrome, but filtering is also available in Firefox and Safari.When you have found the rule you want to customise, you can simply create a more specific rule by prefixing it with html. For example, your could override .ui-corner-all like:I usually just want to replace some color with another value. As colors can be used in many different rules it can be useful to create a ResourceHandler.In the handler check for the PrimeFaces theme:In the resource, replace the color:And register it as follows in the faces-config.xml:For more information on resource handlers see:

They render inconsistently across platforms and can't be resized by the User Agent (e.g browser). Keep the usage of such units for styling on media with fixed and known physical properties (e.g print)If you will use this method, no need to calculateYou can set the font-size of the body to 62.5%(that is 62.5% of the default of 16px), which equates to 10px, or 0.625EMs. Now you can set your font-size in EMs with an easy to remember conversion, divide the px by 10.This makes everything SUPER easy to remember and eliminates the need for conversion tables. Of course, you will still need to use a conversion table for nested elements when using EMs, if you are not being specific in your CSS, which is a whole separate issue.But 76% is much better and you can use this to calculate http://pxtoem.com/Yes it's still relevant: IE6 is still widely used and is unable to resize the fonts defined in px. => Usability issues. That alone is a no-no.andIE 7 and 8 don't resize text sized with pixels either, actually. They do have page zoom, but some people prefer to incease text size only.Here's a summary of what's good and bad about font sizing in general.Font size in css http://easycaptures.com/fs/uploaded/213/2470522253.pngI personally like ems. Others, like Chris Coyier over at CSS-Tricks.com likes pixels. (Chris has an excellent article on the different font units).It really comes down to personal preference.Almost similar or related questions on SOShould we still use em and % for defining the font-size of the website elements?Is there really any point to using relative font sizing in CSS?Why em instead of px?Font size in CSS - % or em?CSS font size: relative vs. absolute values.

In fact, every dimension in my company site ( http://kingdesk.com ) is em based. In all my recent work, I have abandoned such practice for four reasons:I now design exclusively in fixed units, and have never once had a problem or complaint.Oh, and if you're wondering, I no longer try to make sites look pixel perfect in IE6. They are still navigable, and decent looking. But time moves on and 9 year old browsers receive the attention they are due.This article posted in "A List Apart" by Richard Rutter is still relevant,How to Size Text in CSS

http://www.alistapart.com/articles/howtosizetextincss/If you look at the iterations, you'll see that,Text size in pixels – iteration 1Text size in ems – iteration 2Body sized as percentage – iteration 3Setting line height in pixels – iteration 4Setting line height in ems – iteration 5The Safari monospace problem – iteration 6Even though this article is dated 2007, it's still very much relevant.  Setting font sizes is more than just setting an em (or px).Don't use em when you really mean %. The only reason em works is because in CSS 1em which is suppose to represent the size of the letter "M" (em comes from "M") is actually equivalent to the font size. So when you're writing 1em you are actually writing "100% of inherited font-size". The em is meant to be used when specifying box dimensions relative to the font-size (which is rare, really really rare).This hole "you can't re-size it in browser" is a modern day myth that dates back to the stone age, when browsers text resizing was a frontend feature and thus there was still some truth to it. Will my layout magically not break if I use ems? Of course not, that's just wishful thinking!Do modern browsers offer text zoom? In short: not by default. Browsers offer a page zoom by default, and this is buried deep inside the menu bar usually under view. You can expect some of your users to know the shortcut Ctrl+MouseWheel but actual text zoom is more tricky. With the modern trend of doing away with the menu bar (note: as of this writing FF4 beta also does away with it, by default) you should consider users requiring text zoom are those in real need of it. I say this because the trend of tutorials/advice on the net is to simply glorify elastic layout and being able to re-size text but not really the issue. Sadly too many "professionals" in elastic/em/fluid layouts completely miss the point: site should look okey if I zoom to 300% or higher! If it just looks good at things like 130% or 170% that's completely pointless and waste of effort and only really useful when they were stupid enough to set their base font to something like 10px or lower (way too small for large bodies of text).The other issue is "some browsers don't zoom", out of those IE6 is the only relevant one, because it still holds some small share of the internet. If you think otherwise, you've probably been reading some articles from 2002 or so (ie. 1 years after it's introduction), wake up to reality:It may also be useful to know the current trend (as per sites like Google) is kill IE6 asap! You are by no means being professional by supporting this cursed browser from almost a decade ago, along with other monstrosities such as IE5.5. Before reading advice in web design, check the date.Rule of thumb: always write what you mean in the context with the most concise syntax.User who need bigger text are users with poor vision. Poor vision should not be confused with being totally blind when text is of a certain size. Given how wide the types of eye problems are, typically offering a small increase in size such as say 130% or 160% or so, is just no where near enough. You are just trying to be fancy, and it doesn't work at all!What you want is to give your users the ability to resize the text they wish to read. And the recommendation is to offer a simple A/A (2nd "A" should be smaller; complementing it with text such as "normal", "2x larger", etc., is useful). Place this somewhere visible, the most common position is in the right top corner of the content the user wishes to read. The context of "content" is very important:  If you must make your entire site "elastic" (ie. dynamic based on font-size)  Note: extremely large font sizes are not the rare ones, its the other way around. Typically the preferred sizes are 12px (don't have anything lower for base, ever!), 16px and just monster large.Although allowed, I've always felt it's a little nonsensical to size your fonts using em. When used for font sizing, it's a relative measure, and I think it just adds confusion to your CSS. If you really mean to give your font a size relative to it's parent font size, use percents. (font-size: 0.8em is equivalent to font-size: 80%, but the percent is more sensical.)Otherwise use one of the absolute units. Browsers handle and scale them fine now.Ems are very relevant for keeping your layout in proportion. 1em is, in digital typography, the size of the design space for each letter and is equivalent to the point size of the font, e.g. if the current font is 12pt then 1em is 12pt.Percentages and Ems are not interchangeable - whilst it may or may not be preferable to specify a font-size relative to the parent as 80% rather than 0.8em, for example, the same doesn't hold true for anywhere else. If I want a 1em margin around an element that's entirely different from specifying 100%, which in that case would be relative to the amount of space the element occupies.Specifying absolute units will throw the design into chaos. If a user chooses to enlarge their font, some browsers may not scale the text - and nor should they, pixel size should be independent of point size. There is also the issue that if you use relative sizes for fonts and absolute sizes for other measurements then your design will probably die a horrible death, so you should therefore specify all measurements relatively where possible, which means using ems. Browsers that confuse "enlarge font size" with "magnify this web page" on the grounds that "the user wants to see everything bigger and it will keep the page how the designer intended" are wrong, no matter how helpful it may seem. It's things like that which caused HTML to be such a huge mess in the first place.I also don't see the merit in specify a body font-size of 62.5% - whilst it may make measurements easier because 1em = 10px, there are a couple of problems. First, you are still technically working in pixels, and secondly it assumes that the user's default font-size is 16px. If you rely on this ratio anywhere in your layout (such as matching image sizes), your design may suffer should the user have a different default font size, and if you are not relying on it and everything is relative then the font-size doesn't matter because everything will scale to match.So yes, ems are still worthwhile.Sizing fonts in ems doesn't really make much sense, because 1 em is the font size, by definition.Sizing other elements in ems is critical, because it means that when you decide to change the font size, you don't end up completely hosing all your margins, padding, and other layout aspects.I never use pixel sizes for fonts in any program (except Photoshop I suppose, since it just had it in pixels by default). I've always used point size (such as in Word) and have since moved to scaling relatively in CSS with em. I set the body font-size then scale using em.Maybe I'm just used to knowing how big point sizes are on screen and in print. I can never guess the size of a pixel font height so I don't use it.

No matter how I configured z-index in both divs (the image wrapper) and the section I was getting this:Turns out I hadn't set up the background of the section to be background: white;so basically it's like this:Just add the second .absolute div before the other .second div:Because the two elements have an index 0.try this code:http://jsfiddle.net/manojmcet/ks7ds/JSFiddleYou have to put the second div on top of the first one because the both have an z-index of zero so that the order in the dom will decide which is on top. This also affects the relative positioned div because its z-index relates to elements inside the parent div.Css stays the same.How about this?http://jsfiddle.net/P7c9q/4/use the relative div as wrapper and let the yellow div's have normal positioning.Only the black block need to have an absolute position then.I solved my z-index problem by making the body wrapper z-index:-1 and the body z-index:-2, and the other divs z-index:1. And then the later divs didn't work unless I had z-index 200+. Even though I had position:relative on each element, with the body at default z-index it wouldn't work. Hope this helps somebody.

It was originally thought for simple code snippets like i++ or <code>.<pre> "represents a block of preformatted text, in which structure is represented by typographic conventions rather than by elements". It's original purpose was nothing more than exactly this: provide a text in the same way it was given by the author, e.g.You don't need to use each with each other. <pre> has its own roles, like <code> has its own. However, <pre> is a way to signalize that the white-space in the given fragment is important, a role that <code> is missing.However, back to your question: note the exact wording:It says could, not should. You're free to do this how you want. It's not recommended by the W3C in any way, however, I personally recommend you to use <pre><code>....Whenever white-space is part of your code and the structure of your code, you should state that this structure should be kept. As the structure in code is given by typographic conventions (tabs, linefeeds, spaces) I personally recommend you to use <pre><code>, even if it's arguably more code and another node in the DOM. But whenever missing white-space will render your code imperfect it's necessary.Apart from that you can easily differ between inline code and code-blocks without checking element.className, and some JS syntax highlighter work pretty well with <pre><code>... and strip the <code> automatically.Also, if you use a general rule for <code> with white-space:pre;, you cannot use it for inline snippets without additional classes. If you were to create a class instead, you've won nothing compared to <pre><code>.CSS is for presentation.White space is significant (not presentational) in many programming languages.To represent a block of computer code, the pre element can be used with a code element;To represent a block of computer output the pre element can be used with a samp element.<pre><code> for block code that must not wrap.

Use <code> for inline code that can wrap.Line breaks and white spaces in the text enclosed within the <pre> tags is maintained as it is in the html document when displays on the browser.Browsers normally render <pre> text in a fixed-pitched font, with whitespace.<pre> shows line breaks! This prevent you using php function such as nl2br() or adding manually <br /> at every line end.Regards,

I want to change the default appearance of the arrow of a dropdown list so that looks the same across browsers. Is there a way to override the default look and feel of the drop down arrow using CSS or otherwise ?You can acheive this with CSS but you are not techinically changing the arrow itself.In this example I am actually hiding the default arrow and displaying my own arrow instead.No, cross-browser form custimization is very hard if not impossible to get it right for all browsers. If you really care about the appearance of those widgets you should use a javascript implementation.see http://www.456bereastreet.com/archive/200409/styling_form_controls/

and http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/examples/button/btn_example07.htmlIt can be done by:The <select> element is generated by the application and styling is not part of the CSS/HTML spec.You would have to fake it with your own DIV and overlay it on top of the existing one, or build your own control emulating the same functionality.No, you can't do it by using an actual <select>, but there are techniques that allow you to "replace" them with javascript solutions that look better.Here's a good article on the topic: <select> Something NewNot easily done I am afraid. The problem is Css cannot replace the arrow in a select as this is rendered by the browser. But you can build a new control from div and input elements and Javascript to perform the same function as the select. Try looking at some of the autocomplete plugins for Jquery for example.Otherwise there is some info on the select element here:http://www.devarticles.com/c/a/Web-Style-Sheets/Taming-the-Select/We have used YUI, Chosen, and are currently using the jQuery Select2 plugin: https://select2.github.io/ It's pretty robust, the arrow is just the tip of the iceberg.As soon as stylized selects becomes a requirement, I agree with the others, go with a plugin. Don't kill yourself reinventing the wheel.Unless you plan on creating your own drop down list (and not using a standard library drop down list), you are stuck. The DDL control's look is going to be based upon the system you are running and/or the browser that is rendering the output.Try changing the color of your "border-top" attribute to white

I'm looking for a solution to fit a child div into it's parent's width.Most solutions I've seen here are not cross-browser compatible (eg. display: table-cell; isn't supported in IE <=8).The solution is to simply not declare width: 100%.The default is width: auto, which for block-level elements (such as div), will take the "full space" available anyway (different to how width: 100% does it).See: http://jsfiddle.net/U7PhY/2/Just in case it's not already clear from my answer: just don't set a width on the child div.You might instead be interested in box-sizing: border-box.You can use box-sizing css property, it's crossbrowser(ie8+, and all real browsers) and pretty good solution for such cases:FiddleIn your image you've putting the padding outside the child. This is not the case. Padding adds to the width of an element, so if you add padding and give it a width of 100% it will have a width of 100% + padding. In order to what you are wanting you just need to either add padding to the parent div, or add a margin to the inner div. Because divs are block-level elements they will automatically expand to the width of their parent.If you put position:relative; on the outer element, the inner element will place itself according to this one. Then a width:auto; on the inner element will be the same as the width of the outer.In case you want to use that padding space... then here's something:http://jsfiddle.net/qD4zd/All the colors are background colors.You don't even need width: 100% in your child div:http://jsfiddle.net/DanielDZC/w2mev/1/

I end up with a textarea filled with css for them to copy/paste to their website.Is there a way to add this css to the current page in order to have a live preview?if you want to add css textif you want to add css fileI have traditionally appended a <style> block when doing elements. An important thing to note is that because you don't know what any of the existing styles is, or what id's might conflict on the page, it's very useful to keep track of your id's inside your JavaScript application, then using those to populate the injected <style> block. I also tend to run my names through a prefix function to ensure that the generic names of wrapper, and unit do not conflict (they are turned into something like myunique_wrapper and myunique_unit. Incorporating a basic CSS reset like #myWrapper {margin: 0; padding: 0} can be a decent starting platform for building your own custom styles.Addressing your unique case, a live preview so to speak, I would designate a div with standard elements. Then when they click "update" read in the rules and append them to the head. If you want to negate any residual effects from past rules you can remove the last <style> element or better yet give your <style> element an id. I'm not sure if that kind of selection would work, but it should.Can you add a style tag to the DOM, with the contents of the text-area in it? You may want to give it an id so you can change it later.I recommend you start using a decent framework for your web/JavaScript development, personally I'd go with jQuery.There are some code snippets here that show you how to quickly set css properties for elements.

How can I place some HTML element (say, a <div>, for example) in the middle of a browser window (not page, not screen)? Not depending on browser window size, screen resolution, toolbar layout, etc. E.g. I want it to be in the middle of the browser window.To do this you need to know the size of the element you are centering. Any measurement will do (i.e. px, em, percent), but it has to have a fixed size.The css will look as follows:Edit: This centers in the viewport. You can only center in the browser window using JavaScript. But that might be good enough anyway, since you probably want to display a popup/modal box?I surprised that nobody said about position=fixed. It makes exactly what I asked and works in all "human" browsers and IE since 7.This is completely possible with just CSS-- no JavaScript needed:

Here's an exampleHere is the source code behind that example:Here is:And the example:Take a look at the original URL for full info:

http://krustev.net/html_center_content.htmlYou can do whatever you like with this code. The only condition is that any derived work must have a reference to the original author.If you don't know the size of the browser you can simply center in CSS with the following code:HTML code:CSS code:This also helps in any unforeseen changes in the future. This should work with any div or screen size:See more details about flex here. This should work on most of the browsers, see compatibility matrix here.I had a lot of problems with centring and alignment until I found Flexbox as a recommendation in a guide.A Complete Guide to FlexboxI'll post a snippet (that works with Chrome) here for convenience:For more details, please refer to the article.orTo centre align a div you should apply the styleThis is checked and works in all browsers.I don't think you can do that. You can be in the middle of the document, however you don't know the toolbar layout or the size of the browser controls. Thus you can center in the document, but not in the middle of the browser window.If I understand you correct, you want to center the element vertically and horizontally based on the window, not the document.  It can be a bit of a pain, but you can use javascript to detect the window size, scroll position, element size, etc. and then position the element in the center of the window (not the document, but the viewable window).If you want this element to remain in the moddule of the window as you scroll you would need to capture the scroll event and adjust the position.The code for doing this differs from one browser to the next.You could write a JavaScript wto find the window height and width and make it to half to find the centre point.Add you stuff inside a  tag, and set the div top and left from the javascript to the centre coordinates you have found using Javascript.Let me know if you need the code.Hope this helps. Trick is to use absolute positioning and configure the top and left columns. Of course "dead center" will depend on the size of the object/div you are embedding, so you will need to do some work. For a login window I used the following - it also has some safety with max-width and max-height that may actually be of use to you in your example. Configure the values below to your requirement.Working solution.It works for me :).you can center any object in viewport, here is an example using jquerythe html Note: you must execute the function onDomReady and when the window resizes.here is de jsfiddle

Is it syntactically and semantically correct to nest <div> or any other block level element inside the <p> tag. I am talking about HTML4 Transitional DTD.If not then is it OK to instead use <span style="display: block"> instead?Syntactically, a div inside a p is invalid in all standards of HTML. Moreover, when using a conforming HTML parser, it is impossible to place a <div> element inside a <p> in the DOM because the opening <div> tag will automatically close the <p> element. Semantically, the correct choice depends on the content that you are marking up. You will need to show at least a sample full paragraph and possibly the content surrounding it to be sure of providing sufficient information for the correct semantic mark-up to be determined.However, given that both <div> and <span> are semantics free, and that CSS in no way can ever change that, if you are certain that the contents of the <p> tag truly form a paragraph, and that <span style="display: block"> gets you the presentational effect that you are seeking, then that is valid HTML and would be a wholly appropriate solution. No, a paragraph element may not contain other block elements.ReferenceA paragraph tag is intended for a block of text. If your elements is a part of the text (and not block elements), it would be semantically correct, otherwise not. A span tag with display:block is still a block element.It is syntactically incorrect, as you can see for yourself using the W3C markup validator.Semantically and practically I would say it's "ok" in the sense that a) it is very natural, b) all browsers handle it correctly (indeed this is one of the easiest problems they have to face daily).If your HTML is produced by user input (e.g. an HTML editor widget using which visitors can leave comments) then I 'd say simply let it be, even if it is "incorrect".Otherwise, you could change the markup a bit. Personally I would go withand give .para appropriate margins with CSS.FWIW:  I had a paragraph bracketed by paragraph tags.  Inside that I put a div with display:inline on the div.   But it still treated the div as a block element and closed the paragraph, creating a new line with a paragraph spacing.    It appears that any block element inside paragraph tags  forces the paragraph to close even if the block element is being displayed as inline in its CSS.  Without any context, it seems fine to me, so long as your outer tag really is still a paragraph. If your div is something like your top nav bar, then not so much, but if it's a container for an image and caption that you're going to float off to the right, then there's no problem.This post shows something about this. Looks like it is the standard browser behavior.http://blog.programmingsolution.net/html/html-div-tag-inside-html-p-paragraph-tag-does-not-work-correctly/

The most direct way to do what you want is to have your server give you a complete page that only contains the fragment you want to show.As an alternative, you could just use a simple <div> and use the jQuery "load" function to load the whole page and pluck out just the section you want:There may be other things you need to do, and a significant difference is that the content will become part of the main page instead of being segregated into a separate window.I got this work good for me.Is this working for you or not let us know.Source: http://www.dimpost.com/2012/12/iframe-how-to-display-specific-part-of.htmlI needed an iframe that would embed a portion of an external page with a vertical scroll bar, cropping out the navigation menus on the top and left of the page.  I was able to do it with some simple HTML and CSS.  HTMLCSSSomehow I fiddled around and some how I got it to work:I think this is the first time this code has been posted so share itSet the iframe to the appropriate width and height and set the scrolling attribute to "no".If the area you want is not in the top-left portion of the page, you can scroll the content to the appropriate area. Refer to this question:Scrolling an iframe with javascript?I believe you'll only be able to scroll it if both pages are on the same domain.Assuming you are using an iframe to import content available to the public but not owned by you into your website, you can always use the page anchor to direct you iframe to load where you want it to.First you create an iframe with the width and height needed to display the data.Second install addon such as Show Anchors 2 for Firefox and use it to display all the page anchors on the page you would like display in your iframe. Find the anchor point you want your frame to use and copy the anchor location by right clicking on it.(You can download and install the plugin here =>  https://addons.mozilla.org/en-us/firefox/addon/show-anchors-2/)Third use the copied web address with anchor point as your iframe source. When the frame loads, it will show the page starting at the anchor point you specified.That is the condensed instruction list. Hope it helps!

[What's the difference between rgba(0,0,0,0) and transparent?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/32479188/whats-the-difference-between-rgba0-0-0-0-and-transparent)

In  one of my other questions, the solution to fixing a rendering issue was by using the value rgba(255, 255, 255, 255) instead of transparent. We tested using rgba(0, 0, 0, 0) and this still corrected the problem, meaning that it is the definition of transparent that causes the error. However, looking at the W3C CSS3 Specification (and MDN reference) for transparent reveals that rgba(0, 0, 0, 0) and  transparent should be equal:So what gives? Why can two, seemingly, identical values produce different results? I've looked into the formatting of RGBA, and looked for similar questions (to no avail). Every question/answer that mentions the conversion from transparent to rgba(0,0,0,0) always has the words 'should' or 'according' in. (For example here). What is the actual difference, and why does it change the output so much?N.B: This occurs in most, if not all, versions of Internet Explorer. We also know that it occurs in some versions of Firefox.  However Chrome and Safari do not display this behaviour, leading us to believe that there is some sort of patch for this in -webkit.To be able to submit this as a bug we need to reproduce the problem using the minimal amount of code. So, transferred from my other question, here is a comparison of using transparent vs rgba(0,0,0,0), and what happens when we use both.As pointed out by @andyb, there is strange behaviour when using both on separate elements. You would expect only one to wobble, however they both do. As demonstrated:For those who can't test this in Internet Explorer, here is an animated .gif of the problem:This is with transparent on the left, rgba in the middle, and both on the right.As pointed out by @Abhitalks I misread the reference, however I will leave the below in the question to show that we've already considered this possibility, or in case something was missed/overlooked.Thanks to @juan-c-v's answer I decided to attempt to create a test to find the computed value for transparent in each browser, and came up with the following: If you are viewing this in Chrome/Safari, then you will most likely see (comment if you don't) rgba(0,0,0,0). However in IE, you will probably see transparent still. I was reading the MSDN reference and found that:Which explains why the browsers display different results.

However it doesn't explain anywhere what their version of transparent is actually defined as. I looked through the old CSS1 and CSS2 w3c specs and couldn't find an old definition. What does transparent mean?rgba() is a function that calculates the color and transparency for an item, it is very useful when you want to control the color and the alpha of an item, especially if you do not want to totally transparent. Being a function, you are telling the browser what color and transparency exact you want to draw the item, this is closer to JS than CSS.On the other hand, "transparent" is a  CSS property that identifies an item will be completely transparent, without making calculations of color and alpha. Being a CSS property and not a function, each browser applies it in a different way, so it would differ much to the method used by the browser to apply this property.EDIT

Ok, you say that i contradict that in my answer:Well, i dont contradict that. One thing thing is the specification of the W3C standard, and another thing is the implementation of that standard by developers of different browsers. I will not break the code of IE to prove what I'm saying, because it's a bit illegal, directly ask the guys at Microsoft to see their answer.What I've told you is that they are browsers that do not handle transparent and rgba(0, 0, 0, 0) in the same way. That's because the transparent property is much older than the rgba(0, 0, 0, 0) function (you like that more than rgba ()?), And most likely, while for IE have developed an effective method for rgba (r, g, b, a), they are still using the old method with the transparent property.One thing you always have to keep in mind is that no web browser meets the W3C standards to 100%, that is why in most of the new property must be added the specific extension of the manufacturer (moz- webkit-, etc) Think why it is so absurd to write the same thing four times, when everything would be solved using the standard property, and yourself will answer because it is not the same to use transparent and rgba (0, 0, 0, 0) in IE.I've been trying your code for the value transparent in Chrome, installed on a laptop running Windows 7 OS.I'm not getting any wobble whatsoever myself. So I expect this issue is specific for certain browsers and operating systems based on how that specific browser and OS decide to render your element.This issue could be related to whether or not your browser uses hardware acceleration. Now, there is a trick to force your browser to use hardware acceleration : make your browser think that a 3D transformation is being applied to an element.You could to that by adding the following properties to your element :While I'm not entirely sure if this will fix the wobbling issue when using transparent (as I'm not able to reproduce the issue), applying this "hack" should in theory always give you the smoothest rendering.  Check out eg. this article for more information.So for your demo code, you'd end up with this :THE FIDDLE :https://jsfiddle.net/z2r7ypy7/4/In my opinion, it is not good to use the same id twice, whatever you are doing, it is meant as an identifier.

I also do not find it weird that they both show the animation, since both of them have the same id that match the animation in the css. if you do this, only one wobbles, and it makes perfect sense to me.

Perhaps it does not answer your question about the transparent issue, but I am not sure if that is really the issue anyways.edit

No matter which color I try, transparent or rgba(0,0,0,0) in any combination they both animate on Safari.

I need to show child element which is bigger than it's parent element, but without removing overflow:hidden; is this possible?

parent element has position:relative;

child element gets stripped as soon as it's out of it's parents borders.(elements have additional css defined I just put style attributes for clearness)It's completely impossible to do what you want with both overflow: hidden and position: relative on the parent div.. instead you can introduce an extra child div and move overflow: hidden to that.See: http://jsfiddle.net/thirtydot/TFTnU/HTML:CSS:The code below works like a charm.I usually use overflow:hidden as clearfix. In this case, I give up and just add an additional div.Use css...With width auto it will always append to the smallest possible size; and with the reset it will help maintain natural flow.But if the child is bigger in any way than the parent, then it will not be possible. But with this CSS I think you will achieve what you want to the maximum of what is possible.thirtydot's solution is actually a good idea.Here's a clearer example: http://jsfiddle.net/y9dtL68d/HTMLCSSI believe, every front-end developer encountered this situation, at least once. Let's say you need to absolute position something… And then you try to move it in some direction, and boom it disappears… You forgot the parent was set to overflow:hidden and now your element is lost in the hidden infinite vacuum.There is a css trick to do this.Please find the below demo example for it...I did this in a very simple way Here is jsfiddle linkThe Problem has a Name: "offsetParent". As soon as an element gets the position abolute|relative or has its position/size altered by a transformation, it becomes the offsetParent of its children. The original offsetParent for all elements (and therefore the area in which overflowing content will be shown or relative to which absolute positions are given) is the viewport of the browser or the iFrame. But after an absolute or relative position had been applied to an element, ist bounding box is the new origin for positioning and clipping of all of ist children.In a Project, I had a 'popup' window containing a pulldown menu. The pulldown could easily extend over the limits of the window. But as soon as the window was moved (by using a transformation or relative positioning), the pulldown appeared at a wrong place (having the top-left Position of the window as additional Offset) and was clipped at the window's borders. The quick hack I used was to append the pulldown as child of Body (instead fo the window) and position it absolute, using the coordinates of the button that opens the menu (from the clientBoundingBox of the button) and the offset from the button's offsetParent) as absolute position of the pulldown. Then the Body again was the limiting area. This is, however, a bit tricky if it comes to multiple Levels of z-axis ordering (as the pulldown's z-axis is relative to Body, which might be different from the one the window has). But since the window has to be visible (therefore on top) to open the menu, this was negligible.

Of course, this solution requires the use of JavaScript and cannot be done by simple CSS.You can't eat the cake and keep it. If you take something out of the layout context, it becomes ist own, indepenent (and limited) layout 'frame'

I hope, it will be useful summary. Thanks everybody for answers.1.  Layers Hack / Null Transform HackIn 'ancient times' (like 2 years ago) somebody discovered that you can draw your CSS animation faster.How does it work?If you add transform: translateZ(0) to a css selector, it will force a browser to move the element with this selector to the new compositor layer. What is more, it will increase performance (in most situations, use powers of GPU instead CPU) read more here. 2. Bye Bye hacks, welcome "will-change:"Probably, it's too early to say bye bye to Layer Hack, but this time will come shortly.

The new property will change appeared in specs of CSS and will be a great successor of layer hack.3. Browser supportFor now, it's available in Chrome and Opera and partially supported by Firefox as well.4. How to use it properlyThis is probably the most valuable advice that you can get.There is no point to use it straight before an action begins by e.g. adding it to the :hover state of a selector. Because browser will not have required time to prepare optimization before change occurrence. Browser will need approx. 200ms to apply optimization, so for example it is better to add will-change to a element when a parent element is on hover state. MoreExample:You need to use it really sparingly. If you want to optimize everything, the results will be opposite than expected ones. will-change forces browser to keep optimization turned on and reserve resources like memory for changes in the future which may never happen. It is recommended to turn off will-change afterwards, when it is not necessary anymore e.g. when the animation is finished. You can do it easily using JavaScript document.getElementById('my_element_id').style.willChange = off;Now with the help of CSS you can do various of animations, and sometimes this animation becomes a bottleneck for a CPU. So instead of doing this job on a CPU, it would be nice to use GPU for this task. And not so long ago people started to use a trick to do this for a 2D transformation by doing something like:This made a browser think that it is doing a 3D transformation, and because all 3D transformations are using GPU, this will offload CPU. This looks hacky (because in fact it is) and will-change property is going to change this by informing the browser to look out for changes in the future, and optimize and allocate memory accordingly.Based on W3C draft, Good idea to use will-change is to let the browser know in advance what changes on an element can be expected. This allows the browser to make the proper optimizations in advance, which leads to quicker rendering.This information was taken from this excellent explanation about will-change property. The article has additional example when it is nice to use it and when it is useless or even detrimentalAs far as I know...So example usage would be applying that at some point of scroll, with scrollTop:400, then gradually animate opacity and at lets say scrollTop:500, disable will-change again.Source: shoptalkshow podcast - they mention this article - https://dev.opera.com/articles/css-will-change-property/ - which is probably better source of info than my post :DThe best solution for me:But, this solution has trouble with calc in ios safari in a fixed position can cause high battery consumption

Other way around (mentioned in the comments above) is to insert the conversion.js script tag into a hidden div:src: http://keanrichmond.com/google-remarketing-messing-with-my-design.htmlI had the same problem.

    DO NOT USE THOSE OVERLY COMPLICATED ANSWERS. Simply use position:fixed; on that element to take it out of the document flow.Like this:That's it! You keep all original functionality AND you don't have to worry about API changes.Is there any downside to just setting the iframe to be absolute positioning.less code, no !important's and no display: noneHere is my super simple minified solution:I tested and it works in Chrome, FireFox, and IE 10.There are several ways to hide it of course, but why not have another option.I added "border: none;" as my site auto inserted a border that showed a colour even when collapsed.I just used css to set the height and width to zero. Wrapped the conversion.js file around a div with an id and set its child iframe width and height to 0.You can set the style in the main css file.

(Rawat's comment)My preferred way of dealing with this situation is to add:This way you may continue using width in your Flex container and you've given it specific information about how you wish this flex item to behave.Another option, depending on the requirement is to use min-width, which is respected when using flex.add display: contents on the element or div you want to maintain the width.Also (if nothing from above works) Check your min-width and max-width.

It fixed the same problem for me by increasing their range.Add display:inline-block; in left class

How to avoid that blinking without JavaScript (only simple css and html is allowed)?I tried to search Stack Overflow for the similar question, but with no luck.Just added:It happens with all browsers and thus the solution should work for all browsers.Here is a simple and effective css image preloading technique I have used several times.

You can load several images by placing content: url() url() url()... etc.The easiest way to avoid this is to make use of image sprites. For a good overview, check out this CSS Tricks article.That way, you not only solve the flicker problem you're seeing, but will also reduce the number of HTTP requests. Your CSS will look something like:The specifics will depend on your images. You can also make use of an online sprite generator to make the process easier.A simple trick I use is to double up the original background image making sure to put the hovered image firstNo performance hit and very simpleOr if you're not using SCSS yet:If you do this:This will really help!See here:http://particle-in-a-box.com/blog-post/pre-load-hover-images-css-onlyP.S  - not my work but a solution I found :)This is a non-CSS solution: if the hover images are in one directory and have a common naming convention, for example contain a substring '-on.', it is possible to select the file names and put it into the HTML as a series of:@Kristian's method of applying hidden 'content: url()' after the body didn't seem to work in Firefox 48.0 (OS X). However, changing "display: none;" to something like: ... did the trick for me. Perhaps Firefox won't load hidden images, or maybe it's related to rendering(?).If they are the same dimensions, one possibility is to draw the two images directly on top of each other, with the CSS :hover class for the top image having display: none;This way both images will be preloaded, but hovering will make the second visible.You can preload images The "double up the original background image" trick didn't work for me so I used another css trick:This technique works nicely for me and ensures not only is the hover image pre-loaded, but it's also ready and waiting to be displayed. (Most other solutions rely on switching the background image on hover, which just seems to take the browser a bit of time to figure out, however much the image is pre-loaded.)Create :before and :after pseudo elements on the container with the two images, but hide the one you want to see on hover. Then, on hover, switch the visibility.So long as they both share the same size and positioning rules, you should see a neat swap.Just change the size of the background image, instead of the source of it! So...The best way to do this is to just insert the images onto the webpage and set display to none.

I am trying to get a wipe up animation to make a circle look like it's filling with water. I've run into two errors, and haven't been able to even tackle the 3rd one:What I have tried so far: Giving it a default mask position as @anpsmn suggested, doesn't reset it to black anymore.This can be achieved with a single div and a ::before pseudo element:Compatibility: IE10+ and all modern browsers. The -webkit- prefixed property is most likely no longer necessary for your keyframe animations. Check the browser compatibility chart over here on caniuse.comI have added the cubic-bezier(.2,.6,.8,.4) which is explained in @ChrisSpittles answer. It provides a neat effect!Here are four different versions to supplement @misterManSam's brilliant answer.ExplanationIf you filled up a circular bowl full of liquid, it would fill faster at the bottom and top than it would in the middle (because there is more area to cover in the wider middle section). So, with that crude explanation in mind, the animation needs to: start fast, slow in the middle, and then finish fast when the bowl narrows again at the top.To do this we can use a CSS3 easing function: cubic-bezier(.2,.6,.8,.4).Have a look at the example below.(If you want to tweak the easing here is a great resource: http://cubic-bezier.com/#.2,.6,.8,.4)Example:Let's take this one step further? What if we wanted to add a wavy surface on the "water" using CSS? We can do this using the amazing SVG. I created a wavy SVG image in Adobe Illustrator and then animated that to travel from left to right on a loop with a separate CSS animation and voila:ExampleThis example includes a pour line (most bowls fill from the top, not the bottom). The pour line first animates from top to bottom while an animation-delay property prevents the fill animation from happening until the pour has finished.This example adds a few more properties to the CSS to make it look a little more realistic.I think this accomplishes your first goal:Here the working working codpen of Water filling in a div on HoverHTMLCSShttps://codepen.io/ajitkumar96/pen/pOYbQm?editors=1100

I tried this . . .There is no built-in oncontextmenu event handler in jQuery, but you can do something like this:Basically I cancel the oncontextmenu event of the DOM element to disable the browser context menu, and then I capture the mousedown event with jQuery, and there you can know in the event argument which button has been pressed.You can try the above example here.The function returns too early. I've added a comment to the code below:Try swapping the return false; with the next line.Just use the event-handler. Something like this should work:I found this answer here and I'm using it like this.Code from my Library:Code from my page's script:Is contextmenu an event?I would use onmousedown or onclick then grab the MouseEvent's button property to determine which button was pressed (0 = left, 1 = middle, 2 = right).To disable right click context menu on all images of a page simply do this with following:.contextmenu method :-Try as follows .mousedown method:-

Is there a way to change all .btn properties in Bootstrap? I have tried below ones, but still sometimes it shows the default blue color (say after clicking and removing the mouse etc). How can I change the entire theme altogether?The easiest way to see which properties you need to override is to take a look at Bootstrap's source code, specifically the .button-variant mixin defined in mixins/buttons.less. You still need to override quite a lot of properties to get rid of all of the .btn-primary styling (e.g. :focus, disabled, usage in dropdowns etc).A better way might be to:If you want to override any default properties in bootstrap you have to make the properties as important.i hope this will works for you.I guess you forgot .btn-primary:focus property and comma after .btn-primaryYou also can use less and redefine some colors in variables.less fileWith this in mind your code will be look like this:2019 Update for Bootstrap 4Now that Bootstrap 4 uses SASS, you can easily change the primary button color using the button-variant mixins:https://www.codeply.com/go/2bHYxYSC0n (SASS demo)This SASS compiles into the following CSS...https://www.codeply.com/go/lD3tUE01lo (CSS demo)To change the primary color for all classes see: Customizing Bootstrap CSS template and How to change the bootstrap primary color?Just create your own button on:CheersYou have missed one style ".btn-primary:active:focus" which causes that still during btn click default bootstrap color show up for a second.

This works in my code:Remove the button color class like "btn-success" and put a custom class like "btn-custom" and write css for that class. That simply works for me.Here's my flavor without the loss of hover. I personally like it better than the standard bootstrap transitioning.I had run into the similar problem recently, and managed to fix it with adding classesAlso pay attention to [disabled] and [disabled]:hover, if this class is used on input[type=submit]. Like this:The simplest way is to:1) intercept every button state2) add !important to override the statesThe more practical UI way is to make the hover state of the button darker than the original state:I think using !important is not a very wise option. It may cause for many other issues specially when making the site responsive. So, my understanding is that, the best way to do this to use custom button CSS class with .btn bootstrap class. .btn is the base style class for bootstrap button. So, keep that as the layout, we can change other styles using our custom css class. 

One more extra thing I want to mention here. Some people are trying to remove blue outline from the buttons. It's not a good idea because that accessibility issue when using keyboard. Change it's color using outline-color: instead.

I am looking for a way to retrieve the style from an element that has a style set upon it by the style tag.In the body  I'm looking for straight javascript without the use of libraries.I tried the following, but keep receiving blanks:I noticed that I'm only able to use the above if I have set the style using javascript, but unable to with the style tags.The element.style property lets you know only the CSS properties that were defined as inline in that element (programmatically, or defined in the style attribute of the element), you should get the computed style.Is not so easy to do it in a cross-browser way, IE has its own way, through the element.currentStyle property, and  the DOM Level 2 standard way, implemented by other browsers is through the document.defaultView.getComputedStyle method.The two ways have differences, for example, the IE element.currentStyle property expect that you access the CCS property names composed of two or more words in camelCase (e.g. maxHeight, fontSize, backgroundColor, etc), the standard way expects the properties with the words separated with dashes (e.g. max-height, font-size, background-color, etc).Also, the IE element.currentStyle will return all the sizes in the unit that they were specified, (e.g. 12pt, 50%, 5em), the standard way will compute the actual size in pixels always.I made some time ago a cross-browser function that allows you to get the computed styles in a cross-browser way:The above function is not perfect for some cases, for example for colors, the standard method will return colors in the rgb(...) notation, on IE they will return them as they were defined.I'm currently working on an article in the subject, you can follow the changes I make to this function here.I believe you are now able to use Window.getComputedStyle() Documentation MDNExample to get width of an element:In jQuery, you can do alert($("#theid").css("width")).-- if you haven't taken a look at jQuery, I highly recommend it; it makes many simple javascript tasks effortless.for the record, this post is 5 years old. The web has developed, moved on, etc. There are ways to do this with Plain Old Javascript, which is better.You can make function getStyles that'll take an element and other arguments are properties that's values you want.Now, you can use this function like this:ORBy using .css() in jquery the style tag can be accessed and modifiedfor example:

I want to convert a color tuple to a color name, like 'yellow' or 'blue'Is there a simple way in python to do this?It looks like webcolors will allow you to do this:it is vice-versa-able:However webcolors raises an exception if it can't find a match for the requested colour. I've written a little fix that delivers the closest matching name for the requested RGB colour. It matches by Euclidian distance in the RGB space.Output:There is a program called pynche which can change RGB to colour name in English for Python.You can try to use the method ColorDB.nearest() in ColorDB.py which can do what you want.You can find more information about this method here : ColorDB PyncheFor those who, like me, want a more familiar colour name, you can use the CSS 2.1 colour names, also provided by webcolors:Just use fraxel's excellent answer and code for getting the closest colour, adapted to CSS 2.1:A solution to your problem consists in mapping the RGB values to the HSL color space.Once you have the color in the HSL color space you can use the H (hue) component to map it the color. Note that color is a somewhat subjective concept, so you would have to define which ranges of H corresponds to a given color.

If you haveIs there a way to override that in the style sheet to make it displayed?Preferably using something similar to this:Let me begin by saying that generally inline styles can be overridden:.override {color:red !important;}​FiddledThis behavior is described in W3 specs, where it is stated that !important declarations do not alter the specificity, but rather take precedence over "normal" declarations.That being said, when conflicting rules both have the !important flag, specificity dictates that an inline rule is applied - meaning that for OP's scenario, there's no way to override an inline !important.You cannot override inline CSS if it has !important. It has higher precedence than the style in your external CSS file.However, if you want it to change some actions later on, you can use a bit of JavaScript.You can not override inline CSS having !important, because it has higher precedence, but, using JavaScript, you can achieve what you want.You cannot override inline style having !important. First preference is inline style.For eg: we have a class and in jsp here doesn't take the padding-left:4px; .It takes class styleT except the padding-left:4px;.

There will be padding-left:0px;. Here is a simple jQuery solution.You can see this example! There are several rules for CSS selector. The strongest selector is inline (if same level with/without !important). Next ones: id, class, etc. So if a tag is already stylized by inline css with !important, you just have a way: use Javascript to change. As you see, the style by inline css was removed and the id is the strongest selector now !Precedence rules when two CSS properties apply to the same node:So you see the inline !important is the highest precedence.

Try copying the code to a file and running it locally.This is an online/offline solution and very easy to convert.

2.Run the command which ruby.If you see a path such as /usr/bin/ruby, Ruby is installed. If you don't see any response or get an error message, Ruby is not installed.

Thought I would post my solution as someone else might find it useful...which compiles to (used http://winless.org/online-less-compiler)Anton Strogonoff's answer is good but be aware of the Issue @294:Using the above which comes straight from the docs, I get url://pathtolessfile/variable I set.  Even though I'm trying to set an absolute URL instead of a relative one. For example this worksBut this does not workIn the latter example, my final source path becomesHere is an updated and clean way to handle image paths with LESS:Start with your variable:Then use it like this:Make sure the @imagePath variable points to the images folder from wherever you have your compiled CSS, NOT from where you have your LESS files. Also, you have to escape the address in the variable as in the example above to ensure that it does not get rewritten by less.js.Relative urls can be handled by the command line compiler, supposedly. There's probably some similar option you can set in the file watcher.https://github.com/cloudhead/less.js/wiki/Command-Line-UsageEDIT: There totally is.

I loaded Google Maps API v3 and print Google Map in div. But when set width & height to 100% and auto I can't see the Map.Here is HTML code snippet.Is there a way to fix this issue?You have to set all parent containers to a 100% width if you want to cover the whole page with it. You have to set an absolute value at width and height for the #content div at the very least.Setting Map Container to position to relative do the trick. Here is HTML.And Simple CSS.Tested on all browsers. Here is the Screenshot.Very few people realize the power of css positioning. To set the map to occupy 100% height of it's parent container do following:If you have any non absolutely positioned elements inside #map_canvas_container they will set the height of it and the map will take the exact available space.This Work for me.You can set height to -webkit-fill-availableIf you can't affect your parents elements (like in a nested components situation) you can use height: 100vh which will make it a full window (=view) height;Gmap writes inline style position to relative to the div. Overwrite that with : Hope it helps.Better late than never!  I made mine a class:and thenIf that div is the only thing on your page, set:I struggled a lot to find the answer. You don't really need to do anything with body size. All you need to remove the inline style from the map code:remove all the inline style and add class or ID and then style it the way you like.This worked for me.I just added inline style .

<div id="map_canvas" style="width:750px;height:484px;"></div> 

And it worked for me .

Here's a simple menu structure:I want the <a> to be stretched so that it fills the entire <li>. I tried using something like width: 100%; height: 100% but that had no effect. How do I stretch the anchor tag correctly?The "a" tag is an inline level element.  No inline level element may have its width set.  Why?  Because inline level elements are meant to represent flowing text which could in theory wrap from one line to the next.  In those sorts of cases, it doesn't make sense to supply the width of the element, because you don't necessarily know if it's going to wrap or not.  In order to set its width, you must change its display property to block, or inline-block:If memory serves, you can set the width on certain inline level elements in IE6, though.  But that's because IE6 implements CSS incorrectly and wants to confuse you.Just style the A with a display:block;:is the HTML5 way. See FiddleUseful to hack frameworks buttons, or any other element, but you may need to remove their padding first, and set them to the desired height.In this case, angular-material tabs, which are kind of tricky to make them work as a "standard" website nav.Notice that the pointer changes as soon as you enter the tab : the < a > are now stretched to fit their parent dimensions. Out of topic, notice how flawless angular-material displays the ripple effect, even on a "large surface".UPDATE 2018AngularJS Material throws a (gentle) warning when using flex on button elements, so don't assume all HTML elements/tags can handle display:flex properly, or have a homogeneous behaviour across browsers.Remember to consult flexbugs in case of unexpected behaviour in a particular browser.A different approach: This is helpful if the link's container also has images and such inside of it, or is of potentially different sizes depending on image / content size. With this, the anchor tag itself can be empty, and you can arrange other elements inside of anchor's container however you want. Anchor will always match the size of the parent, and will be on top, to make the entire li clickable.I used this code to fill the width and height 100%HTMLCSSJust changing the display property to block didn't work for me.

I removed the padding of li and set the same padding for a.You should try to avoid using a class on every  tag so your content remains easy to maintain.Use line-height and text-indent instead of padding for li element, and use display: block; for anchor tagI wanted this functionality only on tab view i.e below 720px, so in media query I made:If your <li>s had to have a specific height then your <a>s would only stretch to the <li>'s width and not the height anymore.

One way I solve this is to use CSS display:block and add paddings to my <a>s

OR

wrap the <a>s around the <li>s

I want to change "Share This" to "Share",please let me know the solution.thanksl,You can do with either:for textual content orfor html contents.In your case however, the first statement should be fine :)This is my way of thinking about when to use .html() vs. .text().Use .html() when you want to add styling with html tags to the text you are replacing, like:This is ofter useful when you are displaying an error message because you may want to add a class to change the color of the text.  Use .text() when you simply want to change the text.So if you did the above example with .text:   $('#error').text('<span class="errortext red"><strong>Error:</strong> <em>Fix your email address</em></span>');The text the user will see on the web page is (without the spaces in the tags, I could not figure out how to get it to work with this markdown editor).< span class="errortext red">< strong>Error: < em>Fix your email address< /em>< /span>  and that text is not red, or have bold or italic text.$('.stbuttontext').html('Share');Will change the text of all spans with the class stbuttontext.

[Why use .h1 instead of actual h1?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/19099401/why-use-h1-instead-of-actual-h1)

Within the Bootstrap CSS project, styles are provided for your heading tags (H1, H2, H3, H4, H5, H6), but there's also a series of class names based on the headings as well (.h1, .h2, .h3, .h4, .h5, .h6). What is the benefit gained from using the class name of a H1 without properly using the H1 tag? I would think that you always want to make sure your HTML mirrors your visual importance.Any thoughts explaining a good reason for using .h1 instead of using a h1 tag would be appreciated.

What is the benefit gained from using the class name of a H1 without properly using the H1 tag? I would think that you always want to make sure your HTML mirrors your visual importance.Any thoughts explaining a good reason for using .h1 instead of using a h1 tag would be appreciated.You ask:The goal is to use both, together.The usefulness of the .h* classes comes into play when the size of the typography in the design does not correlate with the semantically appropriate heading levels. By splitting the problem in two, we can cleanly solve for both.The first bit is the element/tag. The '<h*>' takes care of semantics, accessibility and SEO.The second bit is the class. The '.h*' takes care of visual semantics and typographical hierarchy. I believe that the origins of these classes come from OOCSS project:Object-Oriented CSSThe latest iteration of OOCSS has changed a little since I last looked at it, but here's the relevant heading.css file, from an older commit, that has the .h1 - .h6 classes that I'm familiar with:6e481bc18f oocss / core / heading / heading.cssFrom the comments:Note the emphasis above.For a good explanation as to why one would use these classes, see:Relevant quotes from the above links:Here's a pseudo-html5 usage example (h/t Jamund Ferguson):Please read full articles (and thread), via links above, for more detailed information related to this question/topic.Most stylesheets have a set of font-sizes that correspond with heading styles 1 through 6. Sometimes, elsewhere on the page, web designers want to use those same font sizes on text which should not be a part of an actual heading element, for semantic reasons. Rather than providing names for each of those sizes like .size-12, .size-14, .size-16, etc, it's easier just to name them all with class names similar to your headings. That way, you know that the text will be the same size as an H1 element, even though it's not actually an H1 element. I've done this a few times myself.A few reasons I can think of:This allows for a separations of visual hierarchy form semantic hierarchy. eg, I want to tell the viewer one thing, while telling a computer (search engines) something else.See:The only thing I can think of offhand is for search engines.  Many will look at an actual h1 tag as the title or subject of a page and use that for searches, etc.  Having multiple h1 tags can confuse the search engine spiders and may screw up searches that would return results for your site (I've also heard it may get you on the "bad site" list with some spiders like Google).Having the styles allows you to have the same visual look to an element without screwing up search engines.Another reason I have come across recently... this is not particular to Angular but it serves as a good example:I want to create dynamic/declarative forms in Angular (see Dynamic Forms in the Angular Cookbook) and allow styled text elements. Maximum flexibility would call for allowing me to declaratively add arbitrary HTML elements to my forms, but this is open to scripting attacks, and requires explicit subversion of the Angular compiler to even allow it. Instead, I allow text elements to be added to forms, along with a class for controlling style. So I can use the .h1 style but not the h1 element.This would definitely help in-terms of SEO and google crawlers to understand your page better.

When it reads h1, it assumes that whatever is in there must be the focal point of the page. H2, would be the second components and so on. This way Google can understand the "scope" of what your page is covering in-terms of content.Not entirely sure, but a big variable in my opinion would be the "read" mode of pages. This would allow devices and readers to organize content especially for devices used by visually impaired people.Also it provides structure to the page and a sense of order.

I found the same issue has been discussed before.I don't know why body{background-image: url(...) do this for all the css files!, although I have different images resources in the file for the buttons, icons, ...etc . I fixed this by moving this rule from the .css file and put it in the inline styles.

For this I fixed by introducing a splash screen all styled on the page.

I believe :first-child is supported, as it's defined in the CSS2.1 specification.One possible solution is to simply give the last child a class name and style that class.Another would be to use JavaScript. jQuery makes this particularly easy as it provides a :last-child pseudo-class which should work in IE8. Unfortunately, that could result in a flash of unstyled content while the DOM loads.If you want to carry on using CSS3 selectors but need to support older browsers I would suggest using a polyfill such as Selectivizr.js

I found that some jQuery Plugin, in their css rule uses 'zoom' descriptor, I even Look into w3c website and found that it is used to magnify but how can I actually implement it? Or I have to Define some viewport? And how do I define such viewport ? Or i am wrong about the whole stuff ?is it possible to use it like Zoom is not included in the CSS specification, but it is supported in IE, Safari 4, Chrome (and you can get a somewhat similar effect in Firefox with -moz-transform: scale(x) since 3.5). See here.So, all browserswill zoom your object in by 2, so it's like doubling the size. Which means if you have On hover, the <a> tag will zoom by 200%.Like I say, in FireFox 3.5+ use -moz-transform: scale(x), it does much the same thing.Edit: In response to the comment from thirtydot, I will say that scale() is not a complete replacement. It does not expand in line like zoom does, rather it will expand out of the box and over content, not forcing other content out of the way. See this in action here. Furthermore, it seems that zoom is not supported in Opera.This post gives a useful insight into ways to work around incompatibilities with scale and workarounds for it using jQuery.Surprised that nobody mentioned that zoom: 1; is useful for IE6-7, to solve most IE-only bugs by triggering hasLayout.This property controls the magnification level for the current element. The rendering effect for the element is that of a「zoom」function on a camera. Even though this property is not inherited, it still affects the rendering of child elements.Examplezoom is a css3 spec for the @viewport descriptor, as described here http://dev.w3.org/csswg/css-device-adapt/#zoom-descused to zoom the entire viewport ('screen'). 

it also happens to zoom individuals elements in a lot of browsers, but not all. 

css3 specifies transform:scale should be used to achieve such an effect:http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-transforms/#transform-functionsbut it works a little different than the 'element zoom' in those browsers that support it.Only IE and WebKit support zoom, and yes, in theory it does exactly what you're saying.Try it out on an image to see it's full effect :)CSS zoom property is widely supported now > 86% of total browser population.See: http://caniuse.com/#search=zoomAs Joshua M pointed out, the zoom function isn't supported only in Firefox, but you can simply fix this as shown:

You can do that vertically too.Alternatively, you may also use the CSS3 Flexible Box Model.

It's a great way to create flexible layouts that can also be applied to center content like so:If you have a relatively- (or otherwise-) positioned div you can center something inside it with margin:autoVertical centering is a bit tricker, but possible.You can use calc to position element relative to center. For example if you want to position element 200px right from the center .. you can do this :When you use signs + and - you must have one blank space between sign and number, but when you use signs * and / there is no need for blank space.Another option is to create an extra wrapper to center the element vertically.

Precise Drag and Drop within a contenteditable

ChaseMoskal

[Precise Drag and Drop within a contenteditable](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/14678451/precise-drag-and-drop-within-a-contenteditable)

So, I have a contenteditable div -- I'm making a WYSIWYG editor: bold, italics, formatting, whatever, and most lately: inserting fancy images (in a fancy box, with a caption).The user adds these fancy images with a dialog I present them with: they fill out the details, upload the image, and then much like the other editor functions, I use document.execCommand('insertHTML',false,fancy_image_html); to plop it in at the user's selection.So, now that my user can plop in a fancy image -- they need to be able to move it around.

The user needs to be able to click and drag the image (fancy box and all) to place it anywhere that they please within the contenteditable. They need to be able to move it between paragraphs, or even within paragraphs -- between two words if they want.Keep in mind -- in a contenteditable, plain old <img> tags are already blessed by the user-agent with this lovely drag-and-drop capability. By default, you can drag and drop <img> tags around wherever you please; the default drag-and-drop operation behaves as one would dream.So, considering how this default behavior already works so smashingly on our <img> buddies -- and I only want to extend this behaviour a little bit to include a tad more HTML -- this seems like something that should be easily possible.First, I set up my fancy <a> tag with the draggable attribute, and disabled contenteditable (not sure if that's necessary, but it seems like it may as well be off):Then, because the user could still drag the image out of the fancy <a> box, I had to do some CSS. I'm working in Chrome, so I'm only showing you the -webkit- prefixes, though I used the others too.Now the user can drag the whole fancy box, and the little partially-faded click-drag representation image reflects this -- I can see that I'm picking up the entire box now :)I've tried several combinations of different CSS properties, the above combo seems to make sense to me, and seems to work best.I was hoping that this CSS alone would be enough for the browser to use the entire element as the draggable item, automagically granting the user the functionality I've been dreaming of... It does however, appear to be more complicated than that.This Drag and Drop stuff seems more complicated than it needs to be.So, I started getting deep into DnD api docs, and now I'm stuck. So, here's what I've rigged up (yes, jQuery):So here's where I'm stuck: This almost completely works. Almost completely. I have everything working, up until the very end. In the drop event, I now have access to the fancy box's HTML content that I'm trying to have inserted at the drop location. All I need to do now, is insert it at the correct location!The problem is I can't find the correct drop location, or any way to insert to it. I've been hoping to find some kind of 'dropLocation' object to dump my fancy box into, something like dropEvent.dropLocation.content=myFancyBoxHTML;, or perhaps, at least, some kind of drop location values with which to find my own way to put the content there?

Am I given anything?Am I doing it completely wrong? Am I completely missing something?I tried to use document.execCommand('insertHTML',false,content); like I expected I should be able to, but it unfortunately fails me here, as the selection caret is not located at the precise drop location as I'd hope.I discovered that if I comment out all of the event.preventDefault();'s, the selection caret becomes visible, and as one would hope, when the user prepares to drop, hovering their drag over the contenteditable, the little selection caret can be seen running along between characters following the user's cursor and drop operation -- indicating to the user that the selection caret represents the precise drop location. I need the location of this selection caret.With some experiments, I tried execCommand-insertHTML'ing during the drop event, and the dragend event -- neither insert the HTML where the dropping-selection-caret was, instead it uses whatever location was selected prior to the drag operation.Because the selection caret is visible during dragover, I hatched a plan.For awhile, I was trying, in the dragover event, to insert a temporary marker, like <span class="selection-marker">|</span>, just after $('.selection-marker').remove();, in an attempt for the browser to constantly (during dragover) be deleting all selection markers and then adding one at the insertion point -- essentially leaving one marker wherever that insertion point is, at any moment. The plan of course, was to then replace this temporary marker with the dragged content which I have.None of this worked, of course: I couldn't get the selection-marker to insert at the apparently visible selection caret as planned -- again, the execCommand-insertedHTML placed itself wherever the selection caret was, prior to the drag operation.How do I obtain, or insert into, the precise location of a drag-and-drop operation?

I feel like this is, obviously, a common operation among drag-and-drops -- surely I must have overlooked an important and blatant detail of some kind? Did I even have to get deep into JavaScript, or maybe there's a way to do this just with attributes like draggable, droppable, contenteditable, and some fancydancy CSS3?I'm still on the hunt -- still tinkering around -- I'll post back as soon as I find out what I've been failing at :)Farrukh posted a good suggestion -- use:To see where the selection caret actually is. I plopped this into the dragover event, which is when I figure the selection caret is visibily hopping around between my editable content in the contenteditable.Alas, the Range object that is returned, reports offset indices that belong to the selection caret prior to the drag-and-drop operation.It was a valiant effort. Thanks Farrukh.So what's going on here? I am getting the sensation that the little selection caret I see hopping around, isn't the selection caret at all! I think it's an imposter!Turns out, it is an imposter! The real selection caret remains in place during the entire drag operation! You can see the little bugger!I was reading MDN Drag and Drop Docs, and found this:Yikes, does this mean I'm supposed to figure it out for myself, based on clientX and clientY?? Using mouse coordinates to determine the location of the selection caret myself? Scary!!I'll look into doing so tomorrow -- unless myself, or somebody else here reading this, can find a sane solution :)

By default, you can drag and drop <img> tags around wherever you please; the default drag-and-drop operation behaves as one would dream.So, considering how this default behavior already works so smashingly on our <img> buddies -- and I only want to extend this behaviour a little bit to include a tad more HTML -- this seems like something that should be easily possible.First, I set up my fancy <a> tag with the draggable attribute, and disabled contenteditable (not sure if that's necessary, but it seems like it may as well be off):Then, because the user could still drag the image out of the fancy <a> box, I had to do some CSS. I'm working in Chrome, so I'm only showing you the -webkit- prefixes, though I used the others too.Now the user can drag the whole fancy box, and the little partially-faded click-drag representation image reflects this -- I can see that I'm picking up the entire box now :)I've tried several combinations of different CSS properties, the above combo seems to make sense to me, and seems to work best.I was hoping that this CSS alone would be enough for the browser to use the entire element as the draggable item, automagically granting the user the functionality I've been dreaming of... It does however, appear to be more complicated than that.This Drag and Drop stuff seems more complicated than it needs to be.So, I started getting deep into DnD api docs, and now I'm stuck. So, here's what I've rigged up (yes, jQuery):So here's where I'm stuck: This almost completely works. Almost completely. I have everything working, up until the very end. In the drop event, I now have access to the fancy box's HTML content that I'm trying to have inserted at the drop location. All I need to do now, is insert it at the correct location!The problem is I can't find the correct drop location, or any way to insert to it. I've been hoping to find some kind of 'dropLocation' object to dump my fancy box into, something like dropEvent.dropLocation.content=myFancyBoxHTML;, or perhaps, at least, some kind of drop location values with which to find my own way to put the content there?

Am I given anything?Am I doing it completely wrong? Am I completely missing something?I tried to use document.execCommand('insertHTML',false,content); like I expected I should be able to, but it unfortunately fails me here, as the selection caret is not located at the precise drop location as I'd hope.I discovered that if I comment out all of the event.preventDefault();'s, the selection caret becomes visible, and as one would hope, when the user prepares to drop, hovering their drag over the contenteditable, the little selection caret can be seen running along between characters following the user's cursor and drop operation -- indicating to the user that the selection caret represents the precise drop location. I need the location of this selection caret.With some experiments, I tried execCommand-insertHTML'ing during the drop event, and the dragend event -- neither insert the HTML where the dropping-selection-caret was, instead it uses whatever location was selected prior to the drag operation.Because the selection caret is visible during dragover, I hatched a plan.For awhile, I was trying, in the dragover event, to insert a temporary marker, like <span class="selection-marker">|</span>, just after $('.selection-marker').remove();, in an attempt for the browser to constantly (during dragover) be deleting all selection markers and then adding one at the insertion point -- essentially leaving one marker wherever that insertion point is, at any moment. The plan of course, was to then replace this temporary marker with the dragged content which I have.None of this worked, of course: I couldn't get the selection-marker to insert at the apparently visible selection caret as planned -- again, the execCommand-insertedHTML placed itself wherever the selection caret was, prior to the drag operation.How do I obtain, or insert into, the precise location of a drag-and-drop operation?

I feel like this is, obviously, a common operation among drag-and-drops -- surely I must have overlooked an important and blatant detail of some kind? Did I even have to get deep into JavaScript, or maybe there's a way to do this just with attributes like draggable, droppable, contenteditable, and some fancydancy CSS3?I'm still on the hunt -- still tinkering around -- I'll post back as soon as I find out what I've been failing at :)Farrukh posted a good suggestion -- use:To see where the selection caret actually is. I plopped this into the dragover event, which is when I figure the selection caret is visibily hopping around between my editable content in the contenteditable.Alas, the Range object that is returned, reports offset indices that belong to the selection caret prior to the drag-and-drop operation.It was a valiant effort. Thanks Farrukh.So what's going on here? I am getting the sensation that the little selection caret I see hopping around, isn't the selection caret at all! I think it's an imposter!Turns out, it is an imposter! The real selection caret remains in place during the entire drag operation! You can see the little bugger!I was reading MDN Drag and Drop Docs, and found this:Yikes, does this mean I'm supposed to figure it out for myself, based on clientX and clientY?? Using mouse coordinates to determine the location of the selection caret myself? Scary!!I'll look into doing so tomorrow -- unless myself, or somebody else here reading this, can find a sane solution :)I've done a ridiculous amount of fiddling. So, so much jsFiddling.This is not a robust, or complete solution; I may never quite come up with one. If anyone has any better solutions, I'm all ears -- I didn't want to have to do it this way, but it's the only way I've been able to uncover so far. The following jsFiddle, and the information I am about to vomit up, worked for me in this particular instance with my particular versions of Firefox and Chrome on my particular WAMP setup and computer. Don't come crying to me when it doesn't work on your website. This drag-and-drop crap is clearly every man for himself.jsFiddle: Chase Moskal's Dragon DropSo, I was boring my girlfriend's brains out, and she thought I kept saying "dragon drop" when really, I was just saying "drag-and-drop". It stuck, so that's what I call my little JavaScript buddy I've created for handling these drag-and-drop situations.Turns out -- it's a bit of a nightmare. The HTML5 Drag-and-Drop API even at first glance, is horrible. Then, you almost warm up to it, as you start to understand and accept the way it's supposed to work.. Then you realize what a terrifying nightmare it actually is, as you learn how Firefox and Chrome go about this specification in their own special way, and seem to completely ignore all of your needs. You find yourself asking questions like: "Wait, what element is even being dragged right now? How to do I get that information? How do I cancel this drag operation? How can I stop this particular browser's unique default handling of this situation?"... The answers to your questions: "You're on your own, LOSER! Keep hacking things in, until something works!".So, here's how I accomplished Precise Drag and Drop of Arbitrary HTML Elements within, around, and between multiple contenteditable's. (note: I'm not going fully in-depth with every detail, you'll have to look at the jsFiddle for that -- I'm just rambling off seemingly relevant details that I remember from the experience, as I have limited time)To the draggables (fancyboxes), I bind a handler for dragstart. We set the dataTransfer to copy a blank string of HTML ' ' -- because we need to trick it into thinking we are going to drag HTML, but we are cancelling out any default behavior. Sometimes default behavior slips in somehow, and it results in a duplicate (as we do the insertion ourselves), so now the worst glitch is a ' ' (space) being inserted when a drag fails. We couldn't rely on the default behavior, as it would fail to often, so I found this to be the most versatile solution.To the dropzones, I bind a handler for dragleave and drop. The dragleave handler exists only for Firefox, as in Firefox, the drag-drop would work (Chrome denies you by default) when you tried to drag it outside the contenteditable, so it performs a quick check against the Firefox-only relatedTarget. Huff.Chrome and Firefox have different ways of acquiring the Range object, so effort had to be put in to do it differently for each browser in the drop event. Chrome builds a range based on mouse-coordinates (yup that's right), but Firefox provides it in the event data. document.execCommand('insertHTML',false,blah) turns out to be how we handle the drop. OH, I forgot to mention -- we can't use dataTransfer.getData() on Chrome to get our dragstart set HTML -- it appears to be some kind of weird bug in the specification. Firefox calls the spec out on it's bullcrap and gives us the data anyways -- but Chrome doesn't, so we bend over backwards and to set the content to a global, and go through hell to kill all the default behavior...Okay, I'm sick of this. I've wrote all I want to about this. I'm calling it a day, and might update this if I think of anything important.Thanks everybody. //Chase.Since I wanted to see this in a native JS solution I worked a bit to remove all jQuery dependencies.

Performance of CSS Transitions vs. JS animation packages

[Performance of CSS Transitions vs. JS animation packages](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2999749/performance-of-css-transitions-vs-js-animation-packages)

I'm wondering is there any difference in performance of using CSS Transitions vs. any of the various JavaScript animation libraries? (script.aculo.us, scripty2, jsAnim, MooTools, $fx, etc).I've tried various tests in Safari and Chrome but I don't actually see any difference. I thought that CSS Transitions were supposed to be hardware accelerated.Update:I've tried using Scriptaculous' Effect.Fade on 5 different DIVs (each containing a canvas with some lines). Doing the exact same thing using CSS transitions, I see absolutely no difference in performance. Both were very smooth with one DIV/Canvas, but both are very slow when I do more than 2 at a time.I've tried this in Safari 4, 5 (OSX), Google Chrome 5 and FireFox 3.7pre. Same results across the board.In answer to UpHelix's response, you're not simply limited to hover, etc. You can trigger a transition by changing any transitionable style. For instance, set the opacity of an element in JavaScript (after, you've specified the transitionPropery and transitionDuration for that element).

For instance, set the opacity of an element in JavaScript (after, you've specified the transitionPropery and transitionDuration for that element).Yes, there is a difference, CSS is much faster. It may be difficult to see until you get many running at the same time or the more they do. CSS animations are limited though. In most cases they really only work off the :hover event. With JavaScript you can perform animations at any event: click, mouseover, mousemove, mouseout, keyup, keydown, etc.In my opinion, jQuery is the best for JavaScript animations in 2010. See jQuery DemosTo add to Uphelix's (correct) answer: JavaScript is an interpreted language and the JS engine of the browser has to parse and execute every instruction during run-time (I know there exist JS compilers, like V8 (used in Chrome), but the principle remains the same).On the other hand, browsers can implement CSS transitions natively, e.g. in C/C++ or something. This code will be compiled to machine language.If CSS transitions are hardware accelerated or not, depends on the techniques the browser uses, the platform the browser runs on, etc.You will notice the difference on mobile browsers (iPhone, Android, etc.).CSS animations have the advantage of being processed by the browser. Fast computations and optimizations are available. In my opinion web animations performance should be looked trough a "holistic" point of view. After all an animation, in terms of FPS, can not be faster then the browser refresh.The real performance level is given by the overall UI performance. A JS and a CSS animation can look similar. However CSS animations win since they do not block the UI thread.Stoyan Stefanov wrote and demo how CSS animations are put out of the UI thread:

I will still run into padding/spacing issues between the two OS's.What should I categorize this issue under? Line-height? Table-cells? OS? etc...Thanks in advance!If it is resolved by using a different font (Arial) then the issue is with the font, not with the CSS. As you have noticed font rendering differs between browsers.One possible solution could be to download the Cutive font (I see it has a SIL license) and then run it through the Font Squirrel font-face generator. In "Expert" mode there is an option to "Fix Vertical Metrics" which might be what you are looking for.I came across this problem with a custom font that had been created for a client's brand. I opened the TTF font in Font Forge. The way I created uniformity with rendering was to adjust the values in Element->Font Info->OS/2->Metrics. Win Ascent/Descent values appear to work differently to the other values. I had the following values:Win Ascent: 1000Win Descent: 0Typo Ascent: 750Typo Descent: -250HHead Ascent: 750HHead Descent: -250I changed the Win Ascent and Descent values to:Win Ascent: 750Win Descent: 250 (notice the positive value)It appears you need to match the values except in my case I needed to invert the value of Win Descent to a positive one. I have very limited knowledge about fonts but this did fix my problem. I generated the font as TTF and then ran it through a web font generator. The fonts now render identically on Mac/Windows 7/Android/iOS. Hope this helps someone. My solution to this (very annoying problem):Enjoy a victory over cross-browser/platform css ridiculousness.I also came across this issue. Luke's answer helped me. I had to adjust the fonts with FontForge using this settings:Uncheck all "Is offset" checkboxes and also the "Really use Typo metrics" checkbox. I had most problems with Firefox and IE. Playing around with the value of "Win Descent" fixed it for those two browsers.Part of the problem may be in the way Windows/Mac OSX renders fonts. Specifically those that are brought in via @font-face. Have you tried switching out which font formats are being used?I witnessed the same issue, with a custom font (Trade Gothic) served by FastFonts.Windows did what it should have.  But all other browsers on Linux based machines, Mac, iOS, Android suffered the problem.My only solution was to match on the user agent, and namespace the body tag with .not-winThen my styles could override the line-height specific to non-windows devices.Since you said in your comment to Jordan Brown that using Arial makes the alignment perfect, this is a font issue. It is likely that whoever created your font did not set the Ascent value properly.If you have the TTF, upload it to FontSquirrel, select the "Expert" option and then keeping all default options. The one that fixes it I believe is "Fix Vertical Metrics." but I had issues when changing the defaults so I recommend keeping them as-is.Now the font line height renders the same on MAC and PC (it worked for me).For those who can't use Font Squirrel, I can confirm that this problem could be fixed in Font Forge for the font I was working with. Based on the answer provided by Luke, here are the steps I followed (no new information here, just providing easy-to-follow instructions):1) Install FontForge (free)

Download from:

https://fontforge.github.io/ 2) Open the problematic font in FontForge3) Choose Element > Font Info

4) On the left panel, click OS/2, then click the Metrics tab5) Change Win Ascent to the same number as HHead Ascent, and Win Descent to the POSITIVE value of HHead Descent (i.e., remove minus sign), then click OK. (If those numbers don't address the problem, try adjusting them until you find numbers that fix the issue for your specific font.) 

6) Click File > Generate Fonts. Choose the font type for your font. If the font is an .otf font, choose OpenType (CFF). Uncheck "Validate Before Saving". Set a name for your new font file. Click Generate.

Thanks to everyone who contributed answers to this question!It's caused by font format history and Windows/Mac wars, there are different ways to compute line height and if they are not synced in the font you use things will go wrong on some systemsYou need to fix your font (if the licensing allows it) or switch to one without this problemSee http://www.webfonts.info/node/330 (warning, this is an infomercial even if the tech info is true)Better, not to make your design depend on an exact value hereThe Mac correctly displays the lengths below the baseline as belonging to line height. It seems that OS X counts bottom up whereas Windows calculates from the Top.Since 1em is the width of the capital M of the used font it is usually smaller than the font's overall height.Have you tried setting the line-height to be the same as the element height? This usually helps solve these kind of problems.

Positioning background image, adding padding [duplicate]

I'd like to add a background to a div, position right center, but!, have some padding to the image.  The div has padding for the text, so I want to indent the background a little.  probably makes most sense w/ example:http://jsbin.com/umuvud/edit#javascript,html,liveThanks!It's been commented multiple times that this is not the correct answer to this question, and I agree.  Back when this answer was written, IE 9 was still new (about 8 months old) and many developers including myself needed a solution for <= IE 9.  IE 9 is when IE started supporting background-origin.  However, it's been over six and a half years, so here's the updated solution which I highly recommend over using an actual border. In case < IE 9 support is needed.  My original answer can be found below the demo snippet.  It uses an opaque border to simulate padding for background images.you can fake it with a 10px border of the same color as the background:http://jsbin.com/eparad/edit#javascript,html,livethis is actually pretty easily done. You're almost there, doing what you've done with background-position: right center;. What is actually needed in this case is something very much like that. Let's convert these to percentages. We know that center=50%, so that's easy enough. Now, in order to get the padding you wanted, you need to position the background like so: background-position: 99% 50%. The second, and more effective way of going about this, is to use the same background-position idea, and just use background-position: 400px (width of parent) 50%;. Of course, this method requires a static width, but will give you the same thing every time.Method 1 (99% 50%)

Method 2 (400px 50%)There is actually a native solution to this, using the four-values to background-position.CssClass {background-position: right 10px top 20px;}This means 10px from right and 20px from top.

you can also use three values the fourth value will be count as 0.you can use background-origin:padding-box; and then add some padding where you want, for example: #logo {background-image: url(your/image.jpg); background-origin:padding-box; padding-left: 15%;}

This way you attach the image to the div padding box that contains it so you can position it wherever you want. In case anyone else needs to add padding to something with background-image and background-size: contain or cover, I used the following which is a nice way of doing it. You can replace the border-width with 10% or 2vw or whatever you like.This means you don't have to define a width.first off, to be a bit of a henpeck, its best NOT to use just the <background> tag.  rather, use the proper, more specific, <background-image> tag.the only way that i'm aware of to do such a thing is to build the padding into the image by extending the matte.  since the empty pixels aren't stripped, you have your padding right there.  so if you need a 10px border, create 10px of empty pixels all around your image.  this is mui simple in Photoshop, Fireworks, GIMP, &c.i'd also recommend trying out the PNG8 format instead of the dying GIF...  much better.there may be an alternate solution to your problem if we knew a bit more of how you're using it.  :)  it LOOKS like you're trying to add an accordion button.  this would be best placed in the HTML because then you can target it with JavaScript/PHP; something you cannot do if it's in the background (at least not simply).  in such a case, you can style the heck out of the image you currently have in CSS by using the following:WR!To add space before background image, one could define the 'width' of element which is using 'background-image' object. And then to define a pixel value in 'background-position' property to create space from left side.For example, I'd a scenario where I got a navigation menu which had a bullet before link item and the bullet graphic were changeable if corrosponding link turns into an active state. Further, the active link also had a background-color to show, and this background-color had approximate 15px padding both on left and right side of link item (so on left, it includes bullet icon of link too).While padding-right fulfill the purpose to have background-color stretched upto 15px more on right of link text. The padding-left only added to space between link text and bullet.So I took the width of background-color object from PSD design (for ex. 82px) and added that to li element (in a class created to show active state) and then I set background-position value to 20px. Which resulted in bullet icon shifted inside from the left edge. And its provided me desired output of having left padding before bullet icon used as background image.Please note, you may need to adjust your padding / margin values accordingly, which may used either for space between link items or for spacing between bullet icon and link text.

Well because this line:It's only importing your css as string, when in reality what you want is your vendor css in a style tag. If you check config/webpack.commons.js you will find this rule:This rule allows your components to import the css files, basically this:In the AppComponent there's no encapsulation, because of this line encapsulation: ViewEncapsulation.None, which means any css rules will be applied globally to your app. So you can import the bootstrap styles in your app component:But if you insist in importing to your vendor.ts then you will need to install a new loader, npm i style-loader --save-dev this will allow webpack to inject css to your page. Then you need to create a specific rule, on your webpack.common.js and change the existing one:The firs rule will be only applied when you try to import css, from any package inside node_modules the second rule will be applied to any css that you import from outside the node_modulesIt is possible by using @import '~bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.css'; on the styles.css file. (Note the ~)Edit: How it works - The '~' is an alias set on the webpack config pointing to the assets folder... simple as that..Edit 2: Example on how to configure webpack with the '~' alias...

this should go on the webpack config file (usually webpack.config.js)...So here is a way to import various CSS files using the angular-cli which I find the most convenient.Basically, you can refer to the CSS files (order is important if you will be overriding them) in the config and angular-cli will take care of the rest. For instance, you might want to include a couple of styles from node-modules, which can be done as follows:A sample full-config might look like this:.angular-cli.json

To disable the calculation which LESS does automatically when discovering a - between two numeric values but still being able to use variables, you can write one of the following:1) Only escape the operator that triggers the calculation and use the variable like you normally do2) Escape the whole expression and interpolate the variable with the @{padding} notationI prefer the second version, since it resembles javascript's template literals and looks a bit cleaner, but either way works just fine.Both solutions disable the automatic Less calculation and compile to the correct result:

However, it will work on most versions of Chrome, Firefox and Safari.Try this (apply to a class you image is in (not img itself), e.g.I had the similar issue and i solved it using:...

here i had to add the padding: 50% because it wasn't working for me otherwise. It allowed me to set the height of container, as per the size ratio of my banner image. and it is also responsive in my case.I believe this should also do the job too:background-size: contain;It specifies that the image should be resized to fit within the element without losing it's aspect ratio.The way to do this is by using background-size so in your case:orYou can set the width and the height of the elements to percentages as wellThis should workDon't use fixed:Mby bootstrap img-responsive class is you looking for.

I read other people had the same issue.Could anyone please help me fixing this?EDIT: declaring @font-face directly in the CSS does not work either.To convert HTML to PDF by wkhtmltopdf try to avoid woff font face. Use the truetype format of the Google Web Fonts with base64 encode.Recently I tried to use a Google web font from Google Web Fonts. In the browser it shows correctly but it doesn't show after converting HTML to PDF.After searching the web extensively, at last, I found tools to encode fonts to the base64 format and also got CSS for @font-face.Read the solution here.A simple solution: Base64-encode your font and embed it in the CSS:FontSquirrel can do this for you through the advanced options of their Webfont Generator; Google and other fonts can be encoded with this tool.I've used this solution with pdfkit and wicked_pdf, which work through wkhtmltopdf, so I presume this should work with the native wkhtmltopdf as well.I had this same problem and solved it by downloading the fonts and running it off of a local file in my web server with this font-face declaration:I was able to find this font on Font Squirrel, but your mileage may vary.I think what happens with the fonts off of Google is that it's trying to load only the format that it thinks this browser wants, which for WebKit is woff (I believe). But wkhtmltopdf can't embed a woff font in a PDF, and so defaults back to sans-serif. By declaring all of them, the TrueType font is included, which is what the PDF actually uses.Also, you need to define the font you want used as the first one in any font-family CSS definition or wkhtmltopdf will just ignore it.I've just tested that using the @importnotation works:I'm using django-wkhtmltopdf version 2.0.3I must have tried a gazillion variations to get this work (from local). I am trying to get Open Sans Condensed embedded into a pdf via WKHtmlToPdf.I think it is important that you download and install the Open Sans Condensed ttf directly from google and install it. It is also important to reboot to allow other services access after install. I downloaded the ttf from font-squirrel originally and condensed was listed as "Open Sans" in windows/fonts, which is wrong, if you look after the google install it is listed as "Open Sans Condensed Light" so even google's local('Open Sans Cond Light') script is wrong. As mentioned before you need to be explicit with the stretch and weights, so this is what has worked for me:I've been struggling with this for about two days now, my advice to you if none of the answers above work for you:Install the font (ttf) in the machine that hosts the webserver and just require it in the css just like you would do with a common font.Now wkhtmltopdf should be able to include the fontIn my case I just had to add this optionand Google Font text started to show up.[wkhtmltopdf 0.12.4 (with patched qt)]Make sure you're not declaring what font you are printing with in your print stylesheet.The following works for me.

I have external links in top menu of my website. 

I want to open these links in new tab. I could achieve it using "target=_blank" in HTML. Is there a similar CSS property or anything else?Unfortunately, no.

In 2013, there is no way to do it with pure CSS.Update: thanks to showdev for linking to the obsolete spec of CSS3 Hyperlinks, and yes, no browser has implemented it. So the answer still stands valid.As c69 mentioned there is no way to do it with pure CSS.but you can use HTML instead:usein your HTML <head> tag for making all of page links which not include target attribute to be opened in a new blank window by default.

otherwise you can set target attribute for each link like this:and it will overridetag if it was defined previously.There are a few ways CSS can 'target' navigation.

This will style internal and external links using attribute styling, which could help signal visitors to what your links will do.You can also target the traditional inline HTML 'target=_blank'.Also :target selector to style navigation block and element targets.CSS :target pseudo-class selector is supported - caniuse, w3schools, MDN. CSS/CSS3 'target-new' property etc, not supported by any major browsers, 2017 August, though it is part of the W3 spec since 2004 February.W3Schools 'modal' construction, uses ':target' pseudo-class that could contain WP navigation. You can also add HTML rel="noreferrer and noopener beside target="_blank" to improve 'new tab' performance. CSS will not open links in tabs for now, but this page explains how to do that with jQuery (compatibility may depend for WP coders).

MDN has a good review at Using the :target pseudo-class in selectorsAnother way to use target="_blank" is:Example:While waiting for the adoption of CSS3 targeting by the major browsers, one could run the following sed command once the (X)HTML has been created:It will add target="_blank" to all external hyperlinks. Variations are also possible.EDITI use this at the end of the makefile which generates every web page on my site.This is actually javascript but related/relevant because .querySelectorAll targets by CSS syntax:this example uses css to target links in a menu with id = "example"that creates a variable which is a collection of the elements we want to change, but we still have actually change them by setting the new target ("_blank"):That code assumes that there are 5 or less elements. That can be changed easily by changing the phrase "i < 5."read more here: http://xahlee.info/js/js_get_elements.html

So if you have this problem make sure the doctype declaration is correct!Please import the docs.css into your application as well. If I must say so, you must have realized that the Twitter Bootstrap Docs are using bootstrap.css and a custom docs.css. Try doing, which you can download from the github package. Then, try playing around with the table classes in docs. css without messing with the master css. Or try adding DOCTYPE in headers. If declaring <!DOCTYPE html> in the very beginning doesn't work, then it's probably not your user-agent style sheet casuing it.

How do you specify table padding in CSS? ( table, not cell padding )

Petruza

[How do you specify table padding in CSS? ( table, not cell padding )](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1750670/how-do-you-specify-table-padding-in-css-table-not-cell-padding)

I have a table with a colored background and I need to specify the padding between the table and it's content, I.E. cells.

The table tag doesn't seem to accept a padding value.

Firebug shows the table and tbody's layout with padding 0 but doesn't accept any value entered for them, so I guess they just don't have the padding property.

But the thing is I want the same separation between cells than the top cells with the table top and the bottom cells with the table's bottom.

Again, what I want is not cell-padding.EDIT: Thanks, what I really needed, I realize now, was border-spacing, or its html equivalent, cellspacing.

But for some reason, they don't do anything in the site I'm working on.

Both work great on a separate HTML, but in the site they don't.

I thought it could be some style overwriting the property, but cellspacing and an inline border-spacing shouldn't get overwritten, right?

(I use firefox )EDIT 2: No, TD padding is NOT what I need. With TD padding, top and bottom paddings of adjacent cells sum up, so there's double the space (pad actually) between two cells than between the top cell and the table top border. I want to have exactly the same distance between them.

With TD padding, top and bottom paddings of adjacent cells sum up, so there's double the space (pad actually) between two cells than between the top cell and the table top border. I want to have exactly the same distance between them.The easiest/best supported method is to use <table cellspacing="10">The css way: border-spacing (not supported by IE I don't think)Edit: if you just want to pad the cell content, and not space them you can simply useORYou could set a margin for the table.  Alternatively, wrap the table in a div and use the div's padding.Here's the thing you should understand about tables... They're not a tree of nested independent elements. They're a single compound element. While the individual TDs behave more or less like CSS block elements, the intermediate stuff (anything between the TABLE and TD, including TRs and TBODYs) is indivisible and doesn't fall into either inline nor block. No random HTML elements are allowed in that other-dimensional space, and the size of such other-dimensional space isn't configurable at all through CSS. Only the HTML cellspacing property can even get at it, and that property has no analog in CSS.So, to solve your problem, I'd suggest either a DIV wrapper as another poster suggests, or if you absolutely must keep it contained in the table, you have this ugly junk:You can't... Maybe if you posted a picture of the desired effect there's another way to achieve it.For example, you can wrap the entire table in a DIV and set the padding to the div.Funny, I was doing precisely this yesterday.  You just need this in your css filethen wrap the table in a suitable divThere is another trick :(Just saw it at my current job)With css, a table can have padding independently of its cells.The padding property is not inherited by its children.So, defining:Should work. You could also specifically tell the browser how to pad (or in this case, not pad) your cells.EDIT: Not supported by IE8. Sorry.You can try the border-spacing property. That should do what you want. But you may want to see this answer.CSS doesn't really allow you to do this on a table level. Generally, I specify cellspacing="3" when I want to achieve this effect. Obviously not a css solution, so take it for what it's worth.Works in Firefox, Chrome, IE11, Edge. 

Why is the span's line-height is useless?

SKing7

[Why is the span's line-height is useless?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11829393/why-is-the-spans-line-height-is-useless)

First, let's see a piece of code:Why is the span's line-height unused?The line-height is still 200px, but when we set span's display property to inline-block, the line-height of the span is used?See below:

2012-08-06 13:36:42Z

First, let's see a piece of code:Why is the span's line-height unused?The line-height is still 200px, but when we set span's display property to inline-block, the line-height of the span is used?See below:Block layouts, like div is by default, are made up of a vertical stack of line boxes, which never have space between them and never overlap. Each line box starts with a strut which is an imaginary inline box the height of the line-height specified for the block. The line box then continues with the inline boxes of the markup, according to their line heights.The diagram below shows the layout for your first example. Note that because 1.7 times the font-height is much less than the height of the strut, the line height is determined by the height of the strut, since the line box must wholly contain its inline boxes. If you had set the line height on the span to be greater than 200px, the line boxes would be taller, and you would see the text move further apart.When you make the span inline-block, the relationship between the div and the span doesn't change, but the span gains it's own block layout structure with its own stack of line boxes. So the the text and the line breaks are laid out within this inner stack. The strut of the inner block is 1.7 times the font-height, i.e., the same as the text, and the layout now looks as below, so the text lines are positioned closer together, reflecting the line-height setting of the span. (Note that the two diagrams are on different scales.)This is by design.  There are two element types within an HTML document: block and inline.  Inline elements don't interrupt the flow of the document, but block elements do.Block elements, as the name suggests, block out an area on the page which contains some content.  Some examples of block elements are: <p> and <div>.  You can apply height, line-height and other CSS properties to these elements in order to change the size of the block, and subsequently, the flow of the document.Inline elements take up the minimum amount of space required to render them, which means setting widths and heights on these elements will have no effect.  As you've already seen, you can tell the browser to treat an inline element as a block element to allow you to apply heights to them.An example of this can be seen when using <li> elements to create menus.  <li>s are block elements.  If you create a list, the items will display vertically on the page, ensuring that each list item appears below the previous one.  However, if you apply display: inline; to the list items, they will now appear horizontally.
