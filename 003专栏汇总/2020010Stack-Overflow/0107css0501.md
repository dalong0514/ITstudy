I am using window.print() for printing page, but I got header and footer contains page title, file path, page number and date. How to remove them? I tried print stylesheet also.Please help. Thanks.In Chrome it's possible to hide this automatic header/footer usingSince the contents will extend to page's limits, the page printing header/footer will be absent. You should, of course, in this case, set some margins/paddings in your body element so that the content won't extend all the way to the page's edge. Since  common printers just can't get no-margins printing and it's probably not what you want, you should use something like this:As Martin pointed out in a comment, if the page have a long element that scrolls past one page (like a big table), the margin is ignored and the printed version will look weird.At the time original of this answer (May 2013), it only worked on Chrome, not sure about it now, never needed to try again. If you need support for a browser that can't hable, you can create a PDF on the fly and print that (you can create a self-printing PDF embedding JavaScript on it), but that's a huge hassle.Firefox :Example :I am sure Adding this code on your css file will solve the problemYou may visit this to know more about this Today my colleague stumbled upon the same issue. As the "margin:0" solution works for chromium based browsers, however, Internet Explorer continue to print footer even if @page margins are set to zero.The solution (more of a hack) was to put negative margin on the @page.Please note that negative margin won't work for Y axis, only for X Hope it helps.The CSS standard enables some advanced formatting. There is a @page directive in CSS that enables some formatting that applies only to paged media (like paper). See http://www.w3.org/TR/1998/REC-CSS2-19980512/page.html.

This will be the simplest solution. I tried most of the solutions in the internet but only this helped me.@page { margin: 0; } works fine in Chrome and Firefox. I haven't found a way to fix IE through css. But you can go into Page Setup in IE on your own machine at and set the margins to 0. Press alt and then the file menu in the top left corner and you'll find Page Setup. This only works for the one machine at a time...1.For Chrome & IEAdd moznomarginboxes attribute in 

Example :I was trying to remove the header and footer of a html page that I printed manually.No solution on this page worked for me but simply by defining my own footer as explained here Firefox would not add its own header and footer.This does not work on Chrome unfortunately.In CSS:Add this to your HTML:you don't have to write any code. just before calling window.print() in the first time change the print settings of your browser.

for example in firefox:and one another example for IE (I'm using IE 11 for previous  versions you can see this Prevent Firefox or Internet Explorer from Printing the URL on Every Page):If you happen to scroll down to this point, I found a solution for Firefox.

How do I make an html div tag to be on top of everything? 

2011-09-14 19:18:57Z

How do I make an html div tag to be on top of everything? In order for z-index to work, you'll need to give the element a position:absolute or a position:relative property. Once you do that, your links will function properly, though you may have to tweak your CSS a bit afterwards.For z-index:1000 to have an effect you need a non-static positioning scheme.Add position:relative; to a rule selecting the element you want to be on topYes, in order for z-index to work, you'll need to give the element a position:absolute or a position:relative property.But... pay attention to parents!You have to go up the nodes of the elements to check if at the level of the common parent the first descendants have a defined z-index.All other descendants can never be in the foreground if at the base there is a lower definite z-index.In this snippet example, div1-2-1 has a z-index of 1000 but is nevertheless under the div1-1-1 which has a z-index of 3.This is because div1-1 has a z-index greater than div1-2.You need to add position:relative; to the menu. Z-index only works when you have a non static positioning scheme.z-index property enables you to take your control at front. the bigger number you set the upper your element you get.position property should be relative because position of html-element should be position relatively against other controls in all dimensions.I gonna assumed you making a popup with code from WW3 school, correct? 

check it css. the .modal one, there're already word z-index there. just change from 1 to 100.

2009-06-18 11:21:04Z

I happened to see a div which had the style clear:both!  What is the use of clear in style?clear:both makes the element drop below any floated elements that precede it in the document.You can also use clear:left or clear:right to make it drop below only those elements that have been floated left or right.Just to add to RichieHindle's answer, check out Floatutorial, which walks you through how CSS floating and clearing works.When you use float without width, there remains some space in that row. To block this space you can use clear:both; in next element.

It however also disables pull-to-refresh, glow effects and scroll chaining.You can however elect to implement your own effect or functionality upon over-scrolling. If you for instance want to blur the page and add a neat animation:Browser SupportAs of this writing Chrome 63+, Firefox 59+ and Opera 50+ support it. Edge publically supported it while Safari is an unknown. Track progress here and current browser compatibility at MDN documentationMore informationOne way you can prevent this, is using the following CSS:This way the body has never any overflow and won't "bounce" when scrolling at the top and bottom of the page. The container will perfectly scroll its content within. This works in Safari and in Chrome.EditWhy the extra <div>-element as a wrapper could be useful: Florian Feldhaus' solution uses slightly less code and works fine too. However, it can have a little quirk, when it comes to content that exceeds the viewport width. In this case the scrollbar at the bottom of the window is moved out of the viewport half way and is hard to recognize/reach. This can be avoided using body { margin: 0; } if suitable. In situation where you can't add this CSS the wrapper element is useful as the scrollbar is always fully visible.Find a screenshot below:

You can use this code to remove touchmove predefined action:Try this wayposition: absolute works for me. I've tested on Chrome 50.0.2661.75 (64-bit) and OSX.Bounce effect cannot be disabled except the height of webpage equals to window.innerHeight, you can let your sub-elements scroll.

I am trying to view, through Chrome's developer tools, how tooltips are structured on a site. However, even when I am hovered over the item, when I "inspect element", nothing shows for the tooltip in the html. I know I can set the Style to :hover, but I still can't see the html or css of the tooltip. Any ideas?I actually found a trick to do that with the Twitter Bootstrap tooltips. If you open the dev tools (F12) on another monitor, then hover over the element to bring up the tooltip, right click as if you were to select 'Inspect Element'. Leaving that context menu open, move the focus over to the dev tools. The html for the tooltip should show up next to the element its a tooltip for in the HTML. Then you can look at it as if it were another element. If you go back to Chrome the HTML disappears so just something to be aware of.Kind of a weird way but it worked for me so I figured I would share it.This solution works without any extra code.Hit command-option-j to open the console. Click the window-looking button on the top right corner of the console to open the console in a different window.Then, in the Chrome window, hover over the element that triggers the popover, hit command-` however many times you need to focus on the console, then type debugger. That'll freeze the page, then you can inspect the element in the Elements tab. F8 will pause debugging. Mouse over the tooltip, and press F8 while it is displayed. You can now use the inspector to look at the CSS. You would just need to force the tooltip to show as suchNow the tooltip will show regardless of hovering state.Scroll down near the bottom of the DOM where you should see the markup.Update see cneuro's comment for Bootstrap 3.Update see Marko Grešak's answer for Chrome and apparently Safari as well, $0 can be used as a shortcut for the currently selected element. This appears to work in Safari as well.For me, the accepted answer didn't work: clicking in DevTools immediately closed the ToolTip.However, I found https://superuser.com/questions/249050/chrome-keyboard-shortcut-to-pause-script-execution which helped me:You can now inspect the element, with JavaScript paused so the DOM won't change.Click f12 go to the console tab and add the following:This will give you 5 seconds to do whatever you want and it will break at 5 seconds. Then you can inspect the target element(ex. hover the element and wait 5 seconds then inspect..)Single window answer, with no codingNone of the other answers are quite right, or have enough detail, so here's my attempt.No code solution for JS activated tooltips:With Chrome's devtools inspect the containing / parent element of the tooltip. In the "elements" tab, right click on that container DOM element then choose "break on" > "subtree modifications". The next time you hover over the part of the DOM the tooltip is housed in, the JS code will be paused allowing you to inspect the contents of the tooltip. Here’s a simple solution: If you have dynamic tooltips, you can make them「persistent」by (temporarily) changing the trigger event to click. This will have the effect that the tooltip only disappears on a click-out:This way, it can be easily inspected with FF’s or Chrome’s debugging tools.Follow these stepsI had problems with this so I went to the documentation and inspected the tooltip that is already rendered on the page. That helped me see the dom structure of the tooltip and edit it accordingly.In Chome on Linux this can be achieved for JS generated tooltips such as those for references on WikiPedia by doing the following:As stated above, open the dev tools using F12. Open them in another window.

Highlight the tooltip and click Ctrl-Shift-C (The HTML Inspector). As you move over the tip, the dev window will show the appropriate section.If you need to keep the tip open when you mouse off it, to be able to inspect it in the other window more thoroughly, then right click on the tooltip and leave the context menu up, and click on the the dev tools window. In this scenario it leaves the tip up in the wikipedia window.To a degree it also works with bootstrap tips.For some reason the answers provided here weren't working for me on Windows. I was able to inspect the tooltip by opening the dev tools, then hovering over the element that brings up the tooltip, then right clicking on that element (not the tooltip). Then, move the cursor over into the inspector panel and scroll down to the bottom. The tooltip element should still be there.1)Open the Inspect window by clicking F122)Go to source tab(next to console)3)Now hover on element to be inspected and keep your mouse over there.4)Using keyboard(Tab or shift+tab) to move the control to pause button or F8Refer the image5)When keyboard focus is on Play button. Hit enter. Your hover element will be freezed you can do anything nowThe dev tools provides a way to inspect a hovered element like a tooltip.1 - Open the dev tools using F12. 2 - Select "Elements" tab.3 - Select the parent element that contains the tooltip.4 - Click on "..." (on the line of the parent element) and after select "Break on"/"subtree modifications" (see image below)5 - Finally go back to application and make the Tooltip shows up. It should block the execution after the Tooltip gets visible Hope it can be useful for someone!Worth noting that toggling the :hover state from within the dev tools only has an impact if the hint text is enabled via CSS :hover rules in the first place. The toggle only applies the hover state to the element for rendering purposes, but does not trigger a corresponding JavaScript mouseover event.Many frameworks such as AngularJS dynamically attach tooltip HTML to the bottom of the document body via JavaScript when a target element is hovered, so any amount of hovering and inspecting the target element won't help. @joeyyang's answer worked very well for me in this scenario.One of the easiest ways I found is:

For example if I have the following HTML:and this CSS:Like how in scripting languages you have generic functions that are used often written at the top of the script and every time you need to use that function you simply call the function instead of repeating all the code every time.No, you cannot reference one rule-set from another.You can, however, reuse selectors on multiple rule-sets within a stylesheet and use multiple selectors on a single rule-set (by separating them with a comma). You can also apply multiple classes to a single HTML element (the class attribute takes a space separated list).Either of those approaches should solve your problem.It would probably help if you used class names that described why an element should be styled instead of how it should be styled. Leave the how in the stylesheet.You can't unless you're using some kind of extended CSS such as SASS. However it is very reasonable to apply those two extra classes to .someDiv. If .someDiv is unique I would also choose to give it an id and referencing it in css using the id.If you're willing and able to employ a little jquery, you can simply do this:If you have a javascript that already processes the page or you can enclose it somewhere in <script> tags.

I am currently using twitter bootstrap 3 and I am facing a problem to create a responsive image. I have used img-responsive class. But the image size is not scaling up. If I use width:100% instead of max-width:100% then it works perfectly.  Where is the problem? This is my code:Bootstrap's responsive image class sets max-width to 100%. This limits its size, but does not force it to stretch to fill parent elements larger than the image itself. You'd have to use the width attribute to force upscaling.http://getbootstrap.com/css/#images-responsive.img-responsive is the right way to make images responsive with bootstrap 3

You can add some height rule for the picture you want to make responsive, because with responsibility, width changes along the height, fix it and there you are.Not sure if it helps you still... but I had to do a small trick to make the image bigger but keeping it responsiveHope it helps

P.S. The max width can be anything you likeIf setting a fixed width on the image is not an option, here's an alternative solution.Having a parent div with display: table & table-layout: fixed.

Then setting the image to display: table-cell and max-width to 100%. That way the image will fit to the width of its parent.Example:Fiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/5y62c4af/Try the following in your CSS stylesheet:Try to do so:1) In your index.html2) In your style.cssI found that you can put the .col class on the image will do the trick - however this gives it extra padding along with any other attributes associated with the class such as float left, however these can be cancelled by say for example a no padding class as an addition.I guess image is than corrupted.

Example: image size is 195px X 146px.It will work inside lower resolutions like tablets. When you have 1280 X 800 resolution it will force larger as there is also width 100 %. Maybe CSS inside media query like icons fonts is the best solution.

I discovered they would not receive padding either.But when I mess with certain properties, like background, border, or this strange appearance property, then font-family and padding have effect, but the native look and feel of the button is lost, which is not a problem if you are completely restyling the buttons.If you want a native looking button, with inherited font-family, use the <button> element instead of <input>.See Codepen.I've had the same problem.

I want the divs to show even though they have no values.Like so, in this case there's no 'Namn' and 'Avn.Namn' in the two columns. However when running this in chrome, they are removed, and do no longer push the other divs in the order float:left. So if I have categories in same divs above, then the values would be placed under wrong category.

So if I have categories in same divs above, then the values would be placed under wrong category.it works if you remove floating. http://jsbin.com/izoca/2/editwith floats it only works if theres some content e.g. &nbsp;Try adding &nbsp; to the empty items.I don't understand why you're not using a <table> here, though? They will do this kind of stuff automatically. Slight update to @no1cobla answer. This hides the period. This solution works in IE8+.A simple solution for empty floated divs is to add:this way you can keep the float functionality and force it to fill space when empty.I use this technique in page layout columns, to keep every column in its position even if the other columns are empty.Example:Simply add a zero width space character inside a pseudo element    This is one way:Why not just add "min-width" to your css-class?  works but that is not right way

I think the w

min-height: 1px;With using the inline-block it will behave as an inline object. so no floats needed to get them next to eachother on one line. And indeed as Rito said, floats need a "body", like they need dimensions.I totally agree with Pekka about using tables. Everybody that build layouts using div's avoid tables like it's a desease. But use them for tablular data! That's what they're ment for. And in your case i think you need them :) BUT if you really really want what you want. There is a css hack way. Same as the float hack.Add that one and you're also set :D (Note: does not work in IE, but that is fixable)If they need to be floated, you could always just set the min-height to 1px so they don't collapse.You can:Set to .kundregister_grid_1:Or use pseudo-elements: ::before or ::after with:Or put &nbsp; inside empty element, but this sometimes can bring unexpected effects eg. in combination with text-decoration: underline;In building a custom set of layout tags, I found another answer to this problem.  Provided here is the custom set of tags and their CSS classes.HTMLCSSThe key here is the Box-Sizing and Padding.

In Twitter's Bootstrap all grids are fluid. Columns are defined as percentage of the total width. But the gutter have a fixed width in pixels. By default a padding of 15px on both side of the column. The combination of width in pixels and percentage could be complex. With border-box this calculating is easy because the border-box value (as opposed to the content-box default) makes the final rendered box the declared width, and any border and padding cut inside the box.

You can override the resize behaviour with CSS:or just simplyValid properties are: both, horizontal, vertical, noneUse the following CSS rule to disable this behavior for all TextArea elements:If you want to disable it for some (but not all) TextArea elements, you have a couple of options (thanks to this page).To disable a specific TextArea with the name attribute set to foo (i.e., <TextArea name="foo"></TextArea>):Or, using an ID (i.e., <TextArea id="foo"></TextArea>):Note that this is only relevant for WebKit-based browsers (i.e., Safari and Chrome), which add the resize handle to TextArea controls.   the safari max-height max-width opportunity also works in firefox 4.0 (b3pre). good example here by the way: http://www.alanedwardes.com/posts/safari-and-resizable-textboxes/

I am looking for a generic solution.Does anyone know how to do this?PS: I do not want to overwrite every style i have set for the hover.There isn’t a pure JavaScript generic solution, I’m afraid. JavaScript isn’t able to turn off the CSS :hover state itself.You could try the following alternative workaround though. If you don’t mind mucking about in your HTML and CSS a little bit, it saves you having to reset every CSS property manually via JavaScript.Use a second class that has only the hover assigned:HTMLCSSNow you can use Jquery to remove the class, for instance if the element has been clicked: JQUERYHope this answer is helpful.You can manipulate the stylesheets and stylesheet rules themselves with javascriptMaking the attributes !important and making this the very last CSS definition should override any previous definition, unless one is more specifically targeted. You may have to insert more rules in that case.This is similar to aSeptik's answer, but what about this approach? Wrap the CSS code which you want to disable using JavaScript in <noscript> tags. That way if javaScript is off, the CSS :hover will be used, otherwise the JavaScript effect will be used.Example:I would use CSS to prevent the :hover event from changing the appearance of the link.This simple CSS means that the links will always be black and not underlined. I cannot tell from the question whether the change in the appearance is the only thing you want to control.I'd recommend to replace all :hover properties to :active when you detect that device supports touch. Just call this function when you do so as touch().I used the not() CSS operator and jQuery's addClass() function. Here is an example, when you click on a list item, it won't hover anymore:For example:HTMLCSSjQueryTry just setting the link color:Edit: or better yet, use the CSS, as Christopher suggestedActually an other way to solve this could be, overwriting the CSS with insertRule.It gives the ability to inject CSS rules to an existing/new stylesheet.

Something likeThis is now possible with custom properties:To understand how this works, see How do I apply opacity to a CSS color variable?If custom properties are not an option, see the original answer below.Unfortunately, no, you'll have to specify the red, green and blue values again for each individual class:You can only use the inherit keyword alone as a value for the property, and even then the use of inherit isn't appropriate here.You could do various things to avoid having to hard code the numbers if you want to. Some of these methods only work if you use a plain white background as they're really adding white on top rather than reducing opacity. The first one should work fine for everything provided:A variation of the gif method, but may have performance issues.CodePen examples: http://codepen.io/chrisboon27/pen/ACdkaNo, it's not possible.You could try a CSS pre-processor, though, if you want to do this sort of thing.From what I could see, at least LESS and Sass have functions that can make colors more, or less, transparent.No, that's not possible.If you want to use rgba, you must set each value together. There's no way to only change the alpha.It's now 2017 and this is now possible withOne classic use case for CSS variables is the ability to individualize parts of a property's value.So here, instead of repeating the whole rgba expression once again -

we split up or 'individulaize' the rgba values into 2 parts / variables  (one for the rgb value and one for the alpha)Then, on hover we can now just modify the --alpha variable:Individualizing CSS Properties with CSS Variables (Dan Wilson)there is an alternative,you can add a linear-gradient background image onto the original color.also, with css3 filter property,you can do that too,but it seems that it will change the text colorhere is a jsfiddle:https://jsfiddle.net/zhangyu911013/epwyL296/2/Why not use :hover and specify a different opacity in the hover class?I had a similar problem. I had 18 different divs working as buttons, and each with a different color. Rather than figure out the color codes for each or use a div:hover selector to change the opacity (which affects all children) I used the pseudo-class :before like in @Chris Boon's answer. Because I wanted to do the coloring on the individual elements, I used :before to create a transparent white div on :hover. This is a very basic washout.According to CanIUse.com, this should have something like 92% support as of early 2014. (http://caniuse.com/#feat=css-gencontent)You can do this with CSS variables, although it's a little messy.First, set a variable containing just the RGB values, in order, of the color you want to use:Then you can assign an RGBA value for a color and pull everything but the alpha value from this variable:This isn't super pretty, but it lets you use the same RGB values but different alpha values for a color.Update: It's not possible to do that unfortunately. You'll need to write two separate selectors of:According to the W3C, the rgba property doesn't have/support the inherit value.I faced a similar problem. Here's what I did and it works fine( only alpha changes on hover and also the text is not affected) by the following steps:1) Apply a highlighted(or any of your choice) class to whichever element you wish to change background alpha of.2) Get the background color rgba3) Store it in a string and manipulate it(change alpha) as you want on hover(mouseenter and mouseleave)HTML Code:CSS Code:Javascript Code:Working Fiddle:http://jsfiddle.net/HGHT6/1/simple solution :exemple : https://jsfiddle.net/epwyL296/14/just play with alpha of background. if you want light instead of darkness, just replace #000 by #fffSimple workaround with opacity if you can accommodate a slight change in background-color:This is about the simplest way; put this in your css stylesheet:done!

My question is; is there any way of having the absolutely positioned element be the complete scroll height of its container without using JS?You need to wrap the text in a div element and include the absolutely positioned element inside of it.Css:Setting the inner div's position to relative makes the absolutely position elements inside of it base their position and height on it rather than on the .container div, which has a fixed height. Without the inner, relatively positioned div, the .full-height div will always calculate its dimensions and position based on .container.http://jsfiddle.net/M5cTN/position: fixed; will solve your issue. As an example, review my implementation of a fixed message area overlay (populated programmatically):And in the HTMLWhen #data becomes longer tha the sceen, #mess keeps its position on the screen, while #data scrolls under it.So gaiour is right, but if you're looking for a full height item that doesn't scroll with the content, but is actually the height of the container, here's the fix. Have a parent with a height that causes overflow, a content container that has a 100% height and overflow: scroll, and a sibling then can be positioned according to the parent size, not the scroll element size. Here is the fiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/M5cTN/196/and the relevant code:html:css:I ran into this situation and creating an extra div was impractical.

I ended up just setting the full-height div to height: 10000%; overflow: hidden;Clearly not the cleanest solution, but it works really fast.

It seems Gmail ignores all styles other than inline rules, e.g.Is this my only option for styling HTML emails when viewed with Gmail?Use inline styles for everything. This site will convert your classes to inline styles: http://premailer.dialect.ca/The answers here are outdated, as of today Sep 30 2016. Gmail is currently rolling out support for the style tag in the head, as well as media queries.  If Gmail is your only concern, you're safe to use classes like a modern developer!For reference, you can check the official gmail CSS docs.As a side note, Gmail was the only major client that didn't support style (reference, until they update anyway).  That means you can almost safely stop putting styles inline.  Some of the more obscure clients may still need them.  Gmail started basic support for style tags in the head area. Found nothing official yet but you can easily try it yourself.

It seems to ignore class and id selectors but basic element selectors work.it will create a style tag in its own head area limited to the div containing the mail bodyI agree with everyone who supports classes AND inline styles. You might have learned this by now, but if there is a single mistake in your style sheet, Gmail will disregard it.You might think that your CSS is perfect, because you've done it so often, why would I have mistakes in my CSS? Run it through the CSS Validator (for example http://www.css-validator.org/) and see what happens. I did that after encountering some Gmail display issues, and to my surprise, several Microsoft Outlook specific style declarations showed up as mistakes.Which made sense to me, so I removed them from the style sheet and put them into a only for Microsoft code block, like so:This is just a simple example, but, who know, it might come in handy some time.As others have said, some email programs will not read the css styles.  If you already have a web email written up you can use the following tool from zurb to inline all of your styles:http://zurb.com/ink/inliner.phpThis comes in extremely handy when using templates like those mentioned above from mailchimp, campaign monitor, etc. as they, as you have found, will not work in some email programs.  This tool leaves your style section for the mail programs that will read it and puts all the styles inline to get more universal readability in the format that you wanted.Note that services and tools for sending emails may be able to inline your CSS for you, allowing CSS in <style> tags to work in Gmail.For instance, if you're sending emails with MailChimp, your CSS from <style> tags will get inlined automatically by default. With Mandrill, you can enable this functionality (although it's disabled by default for performance reasons) by checking the "Inline CSS Styles in HTML Emails" box in the "Sending Defaults" section of the Settings tab:

2013-08-20 22:39:27Z

I have here two divs:Is there a way to make space between these two divs (that have display:table-cell)?You can use border-spacing property:HTML:CSS:JSBin DemoAny other option?Well, not really.Why?Use transparent borders if possible.https://jsfiddle.net/74q3na62/HTMLCSSYou could use the border-spacing property, but it not only generates space between the table cells but also between the table cells and the table container.If you don't need visible borders on you table cells you should therefore use transparent borders to generate cell margins. Transparent borders require setting background-clip: padding-box; because otherwise the background color of the table cells is displayed on the border.Transparent borders and background-clip are supported in IE9 upwards (and all other modern browsers). If you need IE8 compatibility or don't need actual transparent space you can simply set a white border color and leave the background-clip out.Well, the above does work, here is my solution that requires a little less markup and is more flexible.Make a new div with whatever name (I will just use table-split) and give it a width, without adding content to it, while placing it between necessary divs that need to be separated.You can add whatever width you find necessary. I just used 0.6% because it's what I needed for when I had to do this.

Shouldn't both be removed? Or does it mean we should use <small>? Why is <big> removed but <small> is not? What is the problem with <big> which does not apply to <small>?http://www.w3schools.com/html5/html5_reference.aspRemember, the tags are meant to be semantic, not presentational. There is such a thing in English as "fine print". This is what the small tag represents. There is no analogous concept of "big print" except for a header, which is already covered by seven other tags.<small> is used more frequently, for footnotes and such...with <h1>, <h2> and <h3> there just wasn't a use for <big>, hence why it's removed.The same logic that applies to small (as "fine print") is also just as true for big (as "warning"). Public postings, mostly, but also manuals or even contracts often have things written in bigger fonts that signify [so... semantics!] a warning.It's not the same as emphasis, which has a meaning in context, but rather "whatever you skip in this text, this part you should read because it's not the usual blah blah but something with immediate and important consequences"That's why I think big and small should both be out or both in.Some purely presentational tags managed to slip through into the spec before but the 2 standards bodies have finally reached a concesus to remove all purely presentational tags in favour of using CSS. If something has no semantic value and is purely for visual apearance - it does NOT belong in the markup - it belongs in a stylesheet.

Example: If I do $('#container').width(); it will return 543 instead of 543.5. How do I get it to not round the number and return the full 543.5 (or whatever number it is).Use the native Element.getBoundingClientRect rather than the style of the element. It was introduced in IE4 and is supported by all browsers:Note: For IE8 and below, see the "Browser Compatibility" notes in the MDN docs.Just wanted to add my experience here, though the question's old: The consensus above seems to be that jQuery's rounding is effectively just as good as an unrounded calculation -- but that doesn't seem to be the case in something I've been doing.My element has a fluid width, generally, but content that changes dynamically via AJAX. Before switching the content, I temporarily lock the dimensions of the element so my layout doesn't bounce around during the transition. I've found that using jQuery like this:is causing some funniness, like there are sub-pixel differences between the actual width and the calculated width. (Specifically, I will see a word jump from one line of text to another, indicating the the width has been changed, not just locked.) From another question -- Getting the actual, floating-point width of an element -- I found out that window.getComputedStyle(element).width will return an unrounded calculation. So I changed the above code to something likeAnd with THAT code -- no funny bouncing! That experience seems to suggest that the unrounded value actually does matter to the browser, right? (In my case, Chrome Version 26.0.1410.65.)Ross Allen's answer is a good starting point but using getBoundingClientRect().width will also include the padding and the border width which ain't the case the the jquery's width function:If your intent is to get the width value with the precision, you'll have to remove the padding and the border like this:You can use getComputedStyle for it: Use the following to get an accurate width:

With the headers on the left or right side if you would prefer it, so, any suggestions, alternatives, browser issues?First, your second option isn't quite valid HTML in the sense that all of the rows (TR) in a table should contain an equal number of columns (TD). Your header has 1 while the body has 3. You should use the colspan attribute to fix that.Reference: "The THEAD, TFOOT, and TBODY sections must contain the same number of columns." - Last paragraph of section 11.2.3.With that being said, the first option is the better approach in my opinion because it's readable regardless of whether or not I have CSS enabled. Some browsers (or search engine crawlers) don't do CSS and as such, it'll make your data make no sense as the header will then represent columns instead of rows.The First Option...  I think it is the better and simple approach..Honestly, option 1. I would suggest you to look at this example from W3.org(link below). I think this method is the best, because this way your headings will also be interpreted right on screen readers.https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/tables/one-header/#table-with-header-cells-in-the-first-column-onlyIf you want to show a data-bound control element (like asp repeater) in your table, then first option won't be possible.

In IOS8 Safari there is a new bug with position fixed.If you focus a textarea that is in a fixed panel, safari will scroll you to the bottom of the page.

In IOS8 Safari there is a new bug with position fixed.If you focus a textarea that is in a fixed panel, safari will scroll you to the bottom of the page. This makes all sorts of UIs impossible to work with, since you have no way of entering text into textareas without scrolling your page all the way down and losing your place. Is there any way to workaround this bug cleanly? Based on this good analysis of this issue, I've used this in html and body elements in css:I think it's working great for me.The best solution I could come up with is to switch to using position: absolute; on focus and calculating the position it was at when it was using position: fixed;. The trick is that the focus event fires too late, so touchstart must be used.The solution in this answer mimics the correct behavior we had in iOS 7 very closely.The body element must have positioning in order to ensure proper positioning when the element switches to absolute positioning.The following code is a basic example for the provided test-case, and can be adapted for your specific use-case.Here is the same code without the hack for comparison.If the position: fixed; element has any other parent elements with positioning besides body, switching to position: absolute; may have unexpected behavior. Due to the nature of position: fixed; this is probably not a major issue, since nesting such elements is not common.While the use of the touchstart event will filter out most desktop environments, you will probably want to use user-agent sniffing so that this code will only run for the broken iOS 8, and not other devices such as Android and older iOS versions. Unfortunately, we don't yet know when Apple will fix this issue in iOS, but I would be surprised if it is not fixed in the next major version.I found a method that works without the need to change to position absolute!Full uncommented codeBreaking it downFirst you need to have the fixed input field toward the top of the page in the HTML (it's a fixed element so it should semantically make sense to have it near the top anyway):Then you need to save the current scroll position into global variables:Then you need a way to detect iOS devices so it doesn't affect things that don't need the fix (function taken from https://stackoverflow.com/a/9039885/1611058)Now that we have everything we need, here is the fix :)I was able to fix this for select inputs by adding an event listener to the necessary select elements, then scrolling by an offset of one pixel when the select in question gains focus.This isn't necessarily a good solution, but it's much simpler and more reliable than the other answers I've seen here. The browser seems to re-render/re-calculate the position: fixed; attribute based on the offset supplied in the window.scrollBy() function.Much like Mark Ryan Sallee suggested, I found that dynamically changing the height and overflow of my background element is the key - this gives Safari nothing to scroll to.So after the modal's opening animation finishes, change the background's styling:When you close the modal change it back:While other answers are useful in simpler contexts, my DOM was too complicated (thanks SharePoint) to use the absolute/fixed position swap.Cleanly? no.I recently had this problem myself with a fixed search field in a sticky header, the best you can do at the moment is keep the scroll position in a variable at all times and upon selection make the fixed element's position absolute instead of fixed with a top position based on the document's scroll position. This is however very ugly and still results in some strange back and forth scrolling before landing on the right place, but it is the closest I could get.Any other solution would involve overriding the default scroll mechanics of the browser.This is now fixed in iOS 10.3! Hacks should no longer be needed. Haven't dealt with this particular bug, but maybe put an overflow: hidden; on the body when the text area is visible (or just active, depending on your design). This may have the effect of not giving the browser anywhere "down" to scroll to.A possible solution would be to replace the input field.codepenNone of these solutions worked for me because my DOM is complicated and I have dynamic infinite scroll pages, so I had to create my own.Background: I am using a fixed header and an element further down that sticks below it once the user scrolls that far down. This element has a search input field. In addition, I have dynamic pages added during forward and backwards scroll.Problem: In iOS, anytime the user clicked on the input in the fixed element, the browser would scroll all the way to the top of the page. This not only caused undesired behavior, it also triggered my dynamic page add at the top of the page.Expected Solution: No scroll in iOS (none at all) when the user clicks on the input in the sticky element.Solution:Requirements: JQuery mobile is required for the startsroll and stopscroll functions to work.Debounce is included to smooth out any lag created by the sticky element.Tested in iOS10.I just jumped over something like this yesterday by setting height of #a to max visible height (body height was in my case) when #b is visibleex: ps: sorry for late example, just noticed it was needed.I had the issue, below lines of code resolved it for me -

Change it to 550px or so and it should resize fine.Update 2013: The easy way(THX to Archonic via comment)Update 2014: Bootstrap 3.1.1 and 3.2

(they even added it to the documentation)If you're customizing or overriding/editing .less variables, you're looking for:You can establish a new @media query to drop the navbar elements down as you see fit, all you have to do is reset the former to accommodate your new query with the desired drop width. Take this for example:CSSIn the following code you can see how I included the original @media query that handles the drop before the 979px mark and the new query to support your desired drop point of 550px. I modified the original query straight from the bootstrap-responsive css to reset all the styles applied to that specific query for the navbar elements and ported them to the new query that carries the drop point you need instead. This way we can commute all the styles from the original query down to the new query without messing around in the bootstrap-responsive stylesheet, this way the default values will still apply to the other elements in your document.Here is a short demo with a media query set to drop at 550px as you require:

http://jsfiddle.net/wU8MW/Note: I placed the above modified @media queries way down below the css frame as the new modified css is supposed to be loaded first than the responsive css.bootstrap-sass will support the variable $navbarCollapseWidth in the next version (2.2.1.0). You'll be able to update it to do exactly what you want once that version is live!As of August 2013, a Bootstrap 3 "Customize and download" page can be found at http://getbootstrap.com/customize/With Bootstrap 3, the relevant variable is @grid-float-breakpoint.The following Stack Overflow page has additional details: Bootstrap 3 Navbar CollapseI suspect (and hope) this will be implemented in an official way soon.

So before it looked like this:And now it looks like:Note that order of elements is important, otherwise you may have issues with elements going into the next lineI created a separate SCSS file that listed all of the partials that bootstrap needs, that way I can turn the partials on and off depending on what our site needs.

A number of blogs have expressed the performance gain in 'tricking' the GPU to think that an element is 3D by using transform: translateZ(0) to speed up animations and transitions. I was wondering if there are implications to using this transform in the following manner:CSS transformations create a new stacking context and containing block, as described in the spec. In plain English, this means that fixed position elements with a transformation applied to them will act more like absolutely positioned elements, and z-index values are likely to get screwed with.If you take a look at this demo, you'll see what I mean. The second div has a transformation applied to it, meaning that it creates a new stacking context, and the pseudo elements are stacked on top rather than below.So basically, don't do that. Apply a 3D transformation only when you need the optimization. -webkit-font-smoothing: antialiased; is another way to tap into 3D acceleration without creating these problems, but it only works in Safari.If you want implications, in some scenarios Google Chrome performance is horrible with hardware acceleration enabled. Oddly enough, changing the "trick" to -webkit-transform: rotateZ(360deg); worked just fine.I don't believe we ever figured out why.It forces the browser to use hardware acceleration to access the device’s graphical processing unit (GPU) to make pixels fly. Web applications, on the other hand, run in the context of the browser, which lets the software do most (if not all) of the rendering, resulting in less horsepower for transitions. But the Web has been catching up, and most browser vendors now provide graphical hardware acceleration by means of particular CSS rules.Using -webkit-transform: translate3d(0,0,0); will kick the GPU into action for the CSS transitions, making them smoother (higher FPS).Note: translate3d(0,0,0) does nothing in terms of what you see. It moves the object by 0px in x,y and z axis. It's only a technique to force the hardware acceleration.Good read here: http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2012/06/21/play-with-hardware-accelerated-css/I can attest to the fact that -webkit-transform: translate3d(0, 0, 0); will mess with the new position: -webkit-sticky; property. With a left drawer navigation pattern that I was working on, the hardware acceleration I wanted with the transform property was messing with the fixed positioning of my top nav bar. I turned off the transform and the positioning worked fine. Luckily, I seem to have had hardware acceleration on already, because I had -webkit-font-smoothing: antialiased on the html element. I was testing this behavior in iOS7 and Android. On mobile devices sending everything to the GPU will cause a memory overload and crash the application. I encountered this on an iPad app in Cordova. Best to only send the required items to the GPU, the divs that you're specifically moving around. Better yet, use the 3d transitions transforms to do the animations like translateX(50px) as opposed to left:50px;

Any way to declare a size/partial border to a box in css3? For example a box with 350px that only shows a border-bottom in its firsts 60px. I think that might be very useful.Examples: 

Not really. But it's very easy to achieve the effect in a way that degrades gracefully and requires no superfluous markup:I know, this is already solved and pixels were requested. However, I just wanted to share something...Partly underlined text elements can easily achieved by using display:table or display:inline-block(I just don't use display:inline-block because, yeah you know, the awkward 4px-gap).Centering, display:table makes it impossible to center the element with text-align:center.

Let's work around with margin:auto...Well, that's nice, but it's not partially.

As bookcasey already introduced, pseudo-elements are worth gold.Offset, the underline is left aligned right now. To center it, just push the pseudo-element the half of its width (50% / 2 = 25%) to the right....as davidmatas commented, using margin:auto is sometimes more practical, than calculating the margin-offset by hand.So, we can align the underline to the left, right or center (without knowing the current width) by using one of these combinations:Full exampleThis can easily be adopted, so that we can use block-level elements. The trick is to set the pseudo-elements height to the same height as its real element (simply height:100%):Here is another solution that rely on linear-gradient where you can easily create any kind of line you want. You can also have multiple lines (on each side for example) by using multiple background:Here is another syntax to achieve the same as above:I used a grid to build draw some of the borders.See here.Code:CSS does not support partial borders. You'd need to use an adjacent element to simulate this.

Before you go ahead and remove the outline, please read this.

http://www.outlinenone.com/I found a solution, but it is mother of all hacks, hopefully it will serve as a starting point for other more robust solutions. The downside (too big in my opinion) is that any browser that doesn't support text-shadow but supports rgba (IE 9) won't render the text unless you use a library such as Modernizr (not tested, just a theory).Firefox uses the text color to determine the color of the dotted border. So say if you do...Firefox will render the dotted border transparent. But of course your text will be transparent too! So we must somehow display the text. text-shadow comes to the rescue:We put a text shadow with no offset and no blur, so that replaces the text. Of course older browser don't understand anything of this, so we must provide a fallback for the color:This is when IE9 comes into play: it supports rgba but not text-shadow, so you will get an apparently empty select box. Get your version of Modernizr with text-shadow detection and do...Enjoy.Well, Duopixel’s answer is plain perfect. If we go a step further we can make it bulletproof.There you go, only valid for Firefox and the ugly dotted outline around the selected option is gone.Here is a collaboration of solutions to fix styling issues with Firefox select boxes. Use this CSS selector as part of your usual CSS reset. Class removes outline as per question but also removes any background image (as I usually use a custom dropdown arrow and Firefoxes system dropdown arrow can't currently be removed). If using background image for anything other than dropdown image, simply remove line background-image: none !important;In general, form controls are impossible to style to that degree of accuracy. There's no browser I'm aware of that supports a sensible range of properties in all controls.

The problem is I want the containers to align center not left. How can I achieve this.use display:inline-block; instead of floatyou can't centre floats, but inline-blocks centre as if they were text, so on the outer overall container  of your "row" - you would set text-align: center; then for each image/caption container (it's those which would be inline-block;) you can re-align the text to left if you requireCSS Flexbox is well supported these days. Go here for a good tutorial on flexbox.This works fine in all newer browsers:Some may ask why not use display: inline-block? For simple things it is fine, but if you got complex code within the blocks, the layout may not be correctly centered anymore. Flexbox is more stable than float left.try it like this:Just wrap floated elements in a <div> and give it this CSS:Perhaps this what you're looking for - https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_flexbox.aspCSS:HTML:

Two color borders

[Two color borders](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3906983/two-color-borders)

Client wants two color borders for an embossed look. Can I do this on one element? I was hoping to avoid stacking two DOM elements with individual borders.

Client wants two color borders for an embossed look. Can I do this on one element? I was hoping to avoid stacking two DOM elements with individual borders.Yep: Use the outline property; it acts as a second border outside of your border. Beware, tho', it can interact in a wonky fashion with margins, paddings and drop-shadows. In some browsers you might have to use a browser-specific prefix as well; in order to make sure it picks up on it: -webkit-outline and the like (although WebKit in particular doesn't require this).This can also be useful in the case where you want to jettison the outline for certain browsers (such as is the case if you want to combine the outline with a drop shadow; in WebKit the outline is inside of the shadow; in FireFox it is outside, so -moz-outline: 0 is useful to ensure that you don't get a gnarly line around your beautiful CSS drop shadow).Edit: Some people have remarked that outline doesn't jive well with IE < 8. While this is true; supporting IE < 8 really isn't something you should be doing.This is very possible. It just takes a little CSS trickery!Is that what you are looking for?Another way is to use box-shadow:See example here.Have you tried the different border styles available within the CSS spec? There's already two border styles that might accommodate your need:OrOutline is good, but only when you want the border all around.Lets say if you want to make it only on bottom or top you can useAnd for bottom:Hope that this helps.Instead of using unsupported and problematic outline just use Example:HTML:CSS:TEST(JSFiddle):If by "embossing" you mean two borders around each other with two different colours, there is the outline property (outline-left, outline-right....) but it is poorly supported in the IE family (namely, IE6 and 7 don't support it at all). If you need two borders, a second wrapper element would indeed be best.If you mean using two colours in the same border. Use e.g.there are special border-styles for this as well (ridge, outset and inset) but they tend to vary across browsers in my experience.Not possible, but you should check to see if border-style values like inset, outset or some other, accomplished the effect you want.. (i doubt it though..)CSS3 has the border-image properties, but i do not know about support from browsers yet (more info at http://www.css3.info/preview/border-image/)..Simply write style="border:medium double;" for the html tagYou could use This produces a nice effect.

Twitter does something like this but I can't figure it out with CSS it's possible they are using Javascript.Can anybody help with this??But it's CSS3 - http://www.css3.com/css-word-wrap/.Just add to the text, a line text will come automatically in the next line.Try the <wbr> tag - not as elegant as the word-wrap property that others suggested, but it's a working solution until all major browsers (read IE) implement CSS3.Well, you can stick one or more "soft hyphens" (&#173;) in your long unbroken strings. I doubt that old IE versions deal with that correctly, but what it's supposed to do is tell the browser about allowable word breaks that it can use if it has to.Now, how exactly would you pick where to stuff those characters?  That depends on the actual string and what it means, I guess.

The browser doesn't load the image.Your image URL should look like chrome-extension://<EXTENSION_ID>/image.jpgYou would be better off replacing css through javascript. From docs:Chrome has i18n support  that provides the ability to reference your extension in your CSS. I keep my images in an image folder in the extension, so reference assets in the CSS like so:There are a lot of older answers and solutions to this question.As of August 2015 (using Chrome 45 and Manifest version 2), the current "best practice" for linking to local images within Chrome Extensions is the following approach.1) Link to the asset in your CSS using a relative path to your extension's images folder:2) Add the individual asset to to the web_accessible_resources section of your extension's manifest.json file:Note: This method is suitable for a few files, but doesn't scale well with many files.Instead, a better method is to leverage Chrome's support for match patterns to whitelist all files within a given directory:Using this approach will allow you to quickly and effortlessly use images in your Chrome Extension's CSS file using natively supported methods.One option would be to convert your image to base64: and then put the data right into your css like:While this might not be an approach you would want to use when regularly developing a webpage, it is a great option due to some of the constraints of building a Chrome Extension.My solution.With Menifest v2 you need to add web_accessible_resources to the file and then use chrome-extension://__MSG_@@extension_id__/images/pattern.png as the url in your css file.CSS:Manifest.jsonp.s. Your manifest.json might look different to this one.This CSS-version-only works in extension environment (app page, popup page, background page, option page) as well as content_scripts CSS file.In .less file, I always set a variable at the beginning:Then later, if you want to refer to extension-local-resource like images, use:One thing to mention is that in the web_accessible_resources you can use wildcards.  So instead of "images/pattern.png"You can use"images/*"Just to clarify, according to the documentation, every file in an extension is also accessible by an absolute URL like this:Note the <extensionID> is a unique identifier that the extension system generates for each extension. You can see the IDs for all your loaded extensions by going to the URL chrome://extensions. The <pathToFile> is the location of the file under the extension's top folder; it's the same as the relative URL....Changing background image in CSS:Changing background image in CSS through JavaScript:Changing background image in CSS through jQuery:

CSS selector with period in ID

The HTML spec allows for periods (.) in an id:<img id="some.id" />However, using a CSS ID selector rule will not match correctly:#some.id { color: #f00; }The CSS spec for ID Selectors does not mention this case.

So is this a fundamental mismatch between HTML and CSS specs? Is my only alternative to use a different type of CSS selection?

CSS would also be preferable to javascript.EDIT: Should mention that the images are of different sizes and aspect ratios.Adam Luter gave me the idea for this, but it actually turned out to be really simple:IE6 now scales the image fine and this seems to be what all the other browsers use by default.Thanks for both the answers though!I'm glad that worked out, so I guess you had to explicitly set 'auto' on IE6 in order for it to mimic other browsers!I actually recently found another technique for scaling images, again designed for backgrounds.  This technique has some interesting features:The markup relies on a wrapper element:Given the above markup you then use these rules:If you then control the size of wrapper you get the interesting scale effects that I list above.To be explicit, consider the following base state: A container that is 100x100 and an image that is 10x10.  The result is a scaled image of 100x100.So, in other words, the image is always at least as big as the container, but will scale beyond it to maintain it's aspect ratio.This probably isn't useful for your site, and it doesn't work in IE6.  But, it is useful to get a scaled background for your view port or container.Well, I can think of a CSS hack that will resolve this issue.You could add the following line in your CSS file:The above code will only be seen by IE6.

The aspect ratio won't be perfect, but you could make it look somewhat normal.

If you really wanted to make it perfect, you would need to write some javascript that would read the original picture width, and set the ratio accordingly to specify a height.The only way to do explicit scaling in CSS is to use tricks such as found here.IE6 only, you could also use filters (check out PNGFix).  But applying them automatically to the page will need javascript, though that javascript could be embedded in the CSS file.If you are going to require javascript, then you might want to just have javascript fill in the missing value for the height by inspecting the image once the content has loaded.  (Sorry I do not have a reference for this technique).Finally, and pardon me for this soapbox, you might want to eschew IE6 support in this matter.  You could add _width: auto after your width: 75px rule, so that IE6 at least renders the image reasonably, even if it is the wrong size.I recommend the last solution simply because IE6 is on the way out: 20% and going down almost a percent a month.  Also, I note that your site is recreational and in the UK.  Both of these help the demographic lean to be away from IE6:  IE6 usage drops nearly 40% during weekends (no citation sorry), and UK has a much lower IE6 demographic (again no citation, sorry).Good luck!

I have got a problem with a CSS3 animation.This code only works if I remove the change of display.I want to change the display just after the hover but the opacity should be changed using the transition.Based on Michaels answer this is the actual CSS code to useYou can do with CSS animations:If possible - use visibility instead of displayFor instance:This workaround works:I used this to achieve it. They fade on hover but take no space when hidden, perfect!I changed a bit but the result is beautiful.Thank you to everyone.There is another good method to get this done by using pointer-events:Unfortunately, this is not supported in IE10 and below.I had the same problem.  I tried using animations instead of transitions - as suggested by @MichaelMullany and @Chris - but it only worked for webkit browsers even if I copy-pasted with "-moz" and "-o" prefixes.I was able to get around the problem by using visibility instead of display.  This works for me because my child element is position: absolute, so document flow isn't being affected.  It might work for others too.This is what the original code would look like using my solution:If you are triggering the change with JS, let's say on click, there is a nice workaround. You see the problem happens because the animation is ignored on display:none element but browser applies all the changes at once and the element is never display:block while not animated at the same time. The trick is to ask the browser to render the frame after changing the visibility but before triggering the animation.Here is a JQuery example:On absolute or fixed elements you could also use z-index:Other elements should have a z-index between -100 and 100 now.I know, this is not really a solution for your question, because you ask for My approach solves a more general question, but maybe this was the background problem that should be solved by using display in combination with opacity.My desire was to get the Element out of the way when it is not visible.

This solution does exactly that: It moves the element out of the away, and this can be used for transition:This code does not contain any browser prefixes or backward compatibility hacks. It just illustrates the concept how the element is moved away as it is not needed any more.The interesting part are the two different transition definitions. When the mouse-pointer is hovering the .parent element the .child element needs to be put in place immediately and then the opacity will be changed:When there is no hover, or the mouse-pointer was moved off the element, one has to wait until the opacity change has finished before the element can be moved off screen:Moving the object away will be a viable alternative in a case where setting display:none would not break the layout.I hope I hit the nail on the head for this question although I did not answer it.HOW TO ANIMATE OPACITY WITH CSS:

Is it possible to make sidebar navigation stay always fixed on scroll in fluid layout?

2012-02-19 16:15:10Z

Is it possible to make sidebar navigation stay always fixed on scroll in fluid layout?Note: There is a bootstrap jQuery plugin that does this and so much more that was introduced a few versions after this answer was written (almost two years ago) called Affix. This answer only applies if you are using Bootstrap 2.0.4 or lower.Yes, simply create a new fixed class for your sidebar and add an offset class to your content div to make up for the left margin, like so:CSSDemo: http://jsfiddle.net/U8HGz/1/show/

Edit here: http://jsfiddle.net/U8HGz/1/UpdateFixed my demo to support the responsive bootstrap sheet, now it flows with the responsive feature of the bootstrap.Note: This demo flows with the top fixed navbar, so both elements become position:static upon screen resize, i placed another demo below that maintains the fixed sidebar until the screen drops for mobile view.CSSHTMLDemo, edit here.minor note: there is about a 10px/1% difference on the width of the fixed sidebar, its due to the fact that since it doesn't inherit the width from the span3 container div because it is fixed i had to come up with a width. It's close enough.And here is another method if you want to keep the sidebar fixed until the grid drops for small screen/mobile view.CSSDemo, edit here.The latest Boostrap (2.1.0) has a new JS "affix" feature specifically for this type of application, FYI.this will screw up the responsive Webdesign.

Better wrap the fixed sidebar in a media query.CSSHTMLNow the sidebar is only fixed, if the viewpot is bigger then 768px.This isn't possible without javascript. I find affix.js too complex, so I rather use:stickyfloatI started with Andres' answers and ended up getting a sticky sidebar like this:HTML:CSS:JS/jQuery:I'm assuming I also need JS to update the 'sidebarwidth' variable when the viewport is resized.Very easy to get fix nav or everything tag you want. All you need is to write your fix tag like this, and put it in your body sectionWith the current Bootstrap version (3.3.2) there is a nice way to achieve a fixed sidebar for navigation. This solution also works well with the re-introduced container-fluid class, meaning it is easily possible to have a responsive full-screen layout.Normally you would need to use fixed widths and margins or the navigation would overlap the content, but with the help of the empty placeholder column the content is always positioned in the right place.The below setup wraps the content around when you resize the window to less than 768px and releases the fixed navigation.See http://www.bootply.com/ePvnTy1VII for a working example.CSSHTML

2010-09-19 21:27:52Z

I have something like:What is the css selector for the second div (1st div within the "content" div) such that I can set the font color of the date within that div?The MOST CORRECT answer to your question is...This will apply the CSS to the first div that is a direct child of #content (which may or may not be the first child element of #content)Another option:You wantIf we can assume that the H1 is always going to be there, thenbut don't be afraid to specify the id of the content div:That's about as good as you can get cross-browser right now without resorting to a JavaScript library like jQuery. Using h1+div ensures that only the first div after the H1 gets the style. There are alternatives, but they rely on CSS3 selectors, and thus won't work on most IE installs.The closest thing to what you're looking for is the :first-child pseudoclass; unfortunately this will not work in your case because you have an <h1> before the <div>s. What I would suggest is that you either add a class to the <div>, like <div class="first"> and then style it that way, or use jQuery if you really can't add a class:$('#content > div:first')

I've got a horizontal navigation bar made from an unordered list, and each list item has a lot of padding to make it look nice, but the only area that works as a link is the text itself.  How can I enable the user to click anywhere in the list item to active the link?Don't put padding in the 'li' item. Instead set the anchor tag to display:inline-block; and apply padding to it.Define your anchor tag css property as: Then the anchor will occupy the entire list area, so your click will work in the empty space next to your list.Make the anchor tag contain the padding rather than the li. This way, it will take up all the area.Use following:Or you could use jQuery:Super, super late to this party, but anyway: you can also style the anchor as a flex item. This is particularly useful for dynamically sized/arranged list items.(Caveat: flexboxes are obvs still not well supported. Autoprefixer to the rescue!)You should use this CSS property and value into your li:So, you can handle the link with jQuery or JavaScript, or use an a tag, but all other tag elements inside the li should have the CSS property: Just simply apply the below css :here is how I did it Make the <a> inline-block and remove the padding from your <li>Then you can play with the width and the height of the <a> in the <li>Put the width to 100% as a start and see how it worksPS:- Get the help of Chrome Developer Tools when changing the height and widthYou can always wrap the whole tag li in with the hiperlink tag

This can be combined with a div that has the overflow: scroll property to give you a table with fixed headers that can be placed anywhere on your page:Place your table in a container:Use overflow: scroll on your container to enable scrolling:As Dagmar pointed out in the comments, the container also requires a max-width and a max-height.Use position: sticky to have table cells stick to the edge and top, right, or left to choose which edge to stick to:As MarredCheese mentioned in the comments, if your first column contains <td> elements instead of <th> elements, you can use tbody td:first-child in your CSS instead of tbody thTo have the header in the first column stick to the left, use:https://jsfiddle.net/qwubvg9m/1/Nowadays, this is possible to achieve using CSS only with position: sticky property.Here goes a snippet:(jsFiddle: https://jsfiddle.net/hbqzdzdt/5/)Regarding compatibility. It works in all major browsers, but not in IE. There is a polyfill for position: sticky but I never tried it.This is no easy feat. The following link is to a working demo:Link Updated according to lanoxx's commenthttp://jsfiddle.net/C8Dtf/366/Just remember to add these:i don't see any other way of achieving this. Especially not by using css only.This is a lot to go through. Hope this helps :)All of these suggestions are great and all, but they're either only fixing either the header or a column, not both, or they're using javascript. The reason - it don't believe it can be done in pure CSS. The reason:If it were possible to do it, you would need to nest several scrollable divs one inside the other, each with a scroll in a different direction. Then you would need to split your table into three parts - the fixed header, the fixed column and the rest of the data. Fine. But now the problem - you can make one of them stay put when you scroll, but the other one is nested inside the scrolling area of first and is therefore subject to being scrolled out of sight itself, so can't be fixed in place on the screen. 'Ah-ha' you say 'but I can somehow use absolute or fixed position to do that' - no you can't. As soon as you do that you lose the ability to scroll that container. It's a chicken and egg situation - you can't have both, they cancel each other out.I believe the only solution is through javascript. You need to completely seperate out the three elements and keep their positions in sync through javascript. There are good examples in other posts on this page. This one is also worth a look:http://tympanus.net/codrops/2014/01/09/sticky-table-headers-columns/I've made some changes in in jsfiddle. This might be what you're trying to do.I have hardcoded the titles like so:And I added some styles as well.Hope this is what you want :)An example using only CSS:To fix both Headers and Columns, you can use the following plugin:Updated in July 2019Recently is emerged also a pure CSS solution that is based on CSS property position: sticky; (here for more details about it) applied onto each TH item (instead of their parent container)I recently had to create a solution with a fixed header group and a fixed first column. I split my table into div's and used jquery to capture window scrolling.http://jsfiddle.net/TinT/EzXub/2346/A co-worker and I have just released a new GitHub project that supplies an Angular directive that you can use to decorate your table with fixed headers: https://github.com/objectcomputing/FixedHeaderIt relies on css and angular only, with a directive that adds some divs. There is no jQuery required.This implementation isn't as fully-featured as some other implementations, but if your need is simply to add fixed tables, we think this might be a good option.After two days fighting with Internet Explorer 9 + Chrome + Firefox (Windows) and Safari (Mac), I have found a system that is Result:

I need something like this:

How can achieve this with css? I know that one way is use background image, but can I achieve this only with css without any image?There is a hacky way to do this, using the :before pseudo element. You give the :before a border, then rotate it with a CSS transform. Doing it this way adds no extra elements to the DOM, and adding/removing the strikethrough is a simple as adding/removing the class.Here's a demoYou can use background linear-gradient with currentColor to avoid hardcoding font color:If you don't need the element to be fully inline, you can use a pseudo element to place the line on top of the element. This way the angle can be adjusted by changing the pseudo element's size:I think you could probably apply a rotation effect to a horizontal rule.  Something like:With the CSS:FiddleYour mileage may vary depending on browser and version though, so I'm not sure if I'd resort to this.  You might have to pull off some funky VML code to support older versions of IE, for example.CSS3 gradientMy example won't fill your needs perfectly but, for more info and funny tweaks, see http://gradients.glrzad.com/.What you have to do is create a background-gradient of white-black-white and position your opacity at something like 48% 50% 52%.I don't think there is a sustainable css solution to this.My pure CSS solution would be to place another element of text behind your first element of text that  is identical in number of characters (characters being ' '), a text-decleration of line-through, and a transform of rotate.Something like:Text Rotation exampleI am looking forward to seeing better answers from other users.This is an old question but as an alternative you can use CSS3 Linear Gradients for example (http://codepen.io/yusuf-azer/pen/ojJLoG).For extensive explaining and a LESS Solution checkhttp://www.yusufazer.com/tutorials-how-to/how-to-make-a-diagonal-line-through-with-css3/I did it this way using an SVG in the HTM with a CSS class:HTML:CSS:There might be simpler easier ways by now.

How can I indent starting from the second line of a paragraph?I've triedandand Is it literally just the second line you want to indent, or is it from the second line (ie. a hanging indent)?If it is the latter, something along the lines of this JSFiddle would be appropriate.This example shows how using the same CSS syntax in a DIV or SPAN produce different effects.This worked for me: Make left-margin: 2em or so will push the whole text including first line to right 2em. Than add text-indent (applicable to first line) as -2em or so.. This brings first line back to start without margin.

I tried it for list tagsIf you style as list I needed to indent two rows to allow for a larger first word in a para. A cumbersome one-off solution is to place text in an SVG element and position this the same as an <img>. Using float and the SVG's height tag defines how many rows will be indented e.g.Yes it is cumbersome but it is also independent of the width of the containing div.The above answer was to my own query to allow the first word(s) of a para to be larger and positioned over two rows. To simply indent the first two lines of a para you could replace all the SVG tags with the following single pixel img:

I want to use a single font named "Algerian" across my whole website. So, I need to change all HTML tags and I don't want to write different code for different tags like: The method written below is also highly discouraged:Put the font-family declaration into a body selector:All the elements on your page will inherit this font-family then (unless, of course you override it later). DO like thisThe universal selector * refers to all elements, 

this css will do it for you:But unfortunately if you are using FontAwesome icons, or any Icons that require their own font family, this will simply destroy the icons and they will not show the required view.To avoid this you can use the :not selector, a sample of fontawesome icon is <i class="fa fa-bluetooth"></i>, so simply you can use:this will apply this family to all elements in the document except the elements with the tag name <i>, you can also do it for classes:this will apply this family to all elements in the document except the elements with the class "fa" which refers to fontawesome default class,

you can also target more than one class like this:Ensure that mobile devices won't change the font with their default font by using important along with the universal selector * :The universal selector * refers to any element.As a different font is likely to be already defined by the browser for form elements, here are 2 ways to use this font everywhere:There'll still have a monospace font on elements like pre/code, kbd, etc but, in case you use these elements, you'd better use a monospace font there.Important note: if very few people has this font installed on their OS, then the second font in the list will be used. Here you defined no second font so the default serif font will be used, and it'll be Times, Times New Roman except maybe on Linux.

Two options there: use @font-face if your font is free of use as a downloadable font or add fallback(s): a second, a third, etc and finally a default family (sans-serif, cursive (*), monospace or serif). The first of the list that exists on the OS of the user will be used.(*) default cursive on Windows is Comic Sans. Except if you want to troll Windows users, don't do that :) This font is terrible except for your children birthdays where it's welcome.Please place this in the head of your Page(s) if the "body" needs the use of 1 and the same font:Everything between the tags <body> and </body>will have the same fontOk so I was having this issue where I tried several different options.

Black transparent overlay on image hover with only CSS?

[Black transparent overlay on image hover with only CSS?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/18322548/black-transparent-overlay-on-image-hover-with-only-css)

I'm trying to add a transparent black overlay to an image whenever the mouse is hovering over the image with only CSS.  Is this possible?  I tried this: http://jsfiddle.net/Zf5am/565/But I can't get the div to show up.

I'm trying to add a transparent black overlay to an image whenever the mouse is hovering over the image with only CSS.  Is this possible?  I tried this: http://jsfiddle.net/Zf5am/565/But I can't get the div to show up.  I'd suggest using a pseudo element in place of the overlay element. Because pseudo elements can't be added on enclosed img elements, you would still need to wrap the img element though.LIVE EXAMPLE HERE -- EXAMPLE WITH TEXTAs for the CSS, set optional dimensions on the .image element, and relatively position it. If you are aiming for a responsive image, just omit the dimensions and this will still work (example). It's just worth noting that the dimensions must be on the parent element as opposed to the img element itself, see.Give the child img element a width of 100% of the parent and add vertical-align:top to fix the default baseline alignment issues.As for the pseudo element, set a content value and absolutely position it relative to the .image element. A width/height of 100% will ensure that this works with varying img dimensions. If you want to transition the element, set an opacity of 0 and add the transition properties/values.Use an opacity of 1 when hovering over the pseudo element in order to facilitate the transition:END RESULT HEREFor the simplest approach, just add the text as the pseudo element's content value:EXAMPLE HEREThat should work in most instances; however, if you have more than one img element, you might not want the same text to appear on hover. You could therefore set the text in a data-* attribute and therefore have unique text for every img element.EXAMPLE HEREWith a content value of attr(data-content), the pseudo element adds the text from the .image element's data-content attribute:You can add some styling and do something like this:EXAMPLE HEREIn the above example, the :after pseudo element serves as the black overlay, while the :before pseudo element is the caption/text. Since the elements are independent of each other, you can use separate styling for more optimal positioning.Although this feature is only implemented in webkit, and it doesn't have browser compatibility, but It's worth taking a look at:JSFiddle DemoYou were close. This will work:You needed to put the :hover on image, and make the .overlay cover the whole image by adding right:0; and bottom:0.jsfiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/Zf5am/569/Here's a good way using :after on the image div, instead of the extra overlay div: http://jsfiddle.net/Zf5am/576/.overlay didn't have a height or width and no content, and you can't hover over display:none.I instead gave the div the same size and position as .image and changes RGBA value on hover.http://jsfiddle.net/Zf5am/566/You can accomplish this by playing with the opacity of the image and setting the background color of the image to black. By making the image transparent, it will appear darker.CSS:You might need to set the browser-specific opacity too to make this work in other browsers too.I would give a min-height and min-width to your overlay div of the size of the image, and change the background color on hoverSee what I've done here: http://jsfiddle.net/dyarbrough93/c8wEC/First off, you never set the dimensions of the overlay, meaning it wasn't showing up in the first place. Secondly, I recommend just changing the z-index of the overlay when you hover over the image. Change the opacity / color of the overlay to suit your needs.

What is the difference between these two selectors?

2009-07-14 15:51:45Z

What is the difference between these two selectors?.classA.classB refers to an element that has both classes A and B (class="classA classB"); whereas .classA .classB refers to an element with class="classB" descended from an element with class="classA".Edit: Spec for reference: Attribute Selectors (See section 5.8.3 Class Selectors)A style like this is far more common, and would target any type of element of class "classB" that is nested inside any type of element of class "classA".It would work, for example, on:This one, however, targets any type of element that is both class "classA", as well as class "classB".  This type of style is less frequently seen, but still useful in some circumstances.This would apply to this example:However, it would have no effect on the following:(Note that when an HTML element has multiple classes, they are separated by spaces.).classA.classB it means that the elements with both classes name will be selected whereas .classA .classB means that the element with class name classB inside the classA will only be selected.It's officially know as a 'descendant combinator'.Read about it on MDN or in the CSS spec

Sorry! Will try and re-write to reflect actual questionStopDesign has an excellent post on this here. [edit 20091107] These were released as part of the closure library: see the button demo.Basically the custom buttons he shows are created using a simple bit of CSS.He originally used 9 tables to get the effect: But later he used a simple 1px left and right margin on the top and bottom borders to achieve the same effect.The gradient is faked by using three layers: All of the code can be found at the Custom Buttons 3.1 page. (although the gradient without the image is only working in Firefox and Safari)1 - Insert the following CSS:2 - Use one of the following ways to call it (more can be found in the links above)or This is their "Archive" Button, according to Firebug.The CSS is more than I care to organize/paste for this. Perhaps it's just me, but when the markup/css become this heavy, I think I would much rather USE AN IMAGE (or a couple images as backgrounds. Better yet, Sprites). Besides, an image for this button would be less than a single K.As much as I love Google, this seems a bit overkill.Update:

Google is a unique case. If you're a massive site and you wish to internationalize your content, then this image-less technique is actually really cool. It allows you to apply just about any written language to your UI, without needing to generate new images, or fear of breaking your buttons.See Question: What are the advantages of using an imageless button?However you decide to do it, make sure you first render the page with the default:... And then use jQuery to swap the input element with your custom button that has an onClick event. This will ensure that people without JavaScript enabled will still be able to use your site.Usability should come first!You could use this jquery plugin I've developed. The buttons work pratically anywhere and since it's a plugin they're easy to set up and configure.http://swizec.com/code/styledButton/Updating this post for 2011:

Google launched a new design across its services in July 2011. The new Google buttons have been recreated here: http://pixify.com/blog/use-google-plus-to-improve-your-ui/

The new buttons look like this:

You could try using the Firebug plugin for Firefox to view the CSS on the button.The biggest problem you are going to have will be making it work across browsers.I think you should strongly consider whether you really need it ... Google gets a lot of bang for the buck by making something like this because of the vast number of buttons and languages that they need; I suspect that most sites and applications would be just as well-off using an image.An open-source component is a good idea, though: spread the wealth and effort widely.The majority of the work here probably won't be the design - those posts are already an excellent How-To on the gradient effects.The problem is getting this working in all browsers, or more specifically the quirky piles of rubbish that are IE6 and IE7.I think you're on the right track with a standard button that gets re-written with jQuery - that way you'll still be accessible for screen readers and can degrade nicely in really old browsers.For the HTML I think your best bet is to visit Gmail with each browser and see what HTML is produced - I'd expect it to be completely different for IE6, IE7, (also depending on whether they need quirks-mode) and everything else. These were released as part of the closure library: see the button demoThe Web Developer Toolbar has a view style information under the css menu that will tell  you what css is applied to an item. There is also the Edit CSS feature in that menu that will let you change the CSS on the fly to see how it affects the page.The post with a link to the closure library does not apply. What was released as part of the closure library uses buttons with gradients.The other solutions listed are useless. You cannot go from there and get these buttons working on every browser Gmail has them working. What Bowman shows on his site is not working code.

I have two DIVs that I need to position exactly on top of each other. However, when I do that, the formatting gets all screwed up because the containing DIV acts like there is no height.

I have two DIVs that I need to position exactly on top of each other. However, when I do that, the formatting gets all screwed up because the containing DIV acts like there is no height. I think this is the expected behavior with position:absolute but I need to find a way to position these two elements on top of each other and have the container stretch as the content stretches:The top left edge of .layer2 should be exactly aligned to the top left edge of layer1First of all, you really should be including the position on absolutely positioned elements or you will come across odd and confusing behavior; you probably want to add top: 0; left: 0 to the CSS for both of your absolutely positioned elements. You'll also want to have position: relative on .container_row if you want the absolutely positioned elements to be positioned with respect to their parent rather than the document's body:Your problem is that position: absolute removes elements from the normal flow:This means that absolutely positioned elements have no effect whatsoever on their parent element's size and your first <div class="container_row"> will have a height of zero.So you can't do what you're trying to do with absolutely positioned elements unless you know how tall they're going to be (or, equivalently, you can specify their height). If you can specify the heights then you can put the same heights on the .container_row and everything will line up; you could also put a margin-top on the second .container_row to leave room for the absolutely positioned elements. For example:Actually this is possible without position absolute and specifying any height. All You need to do, is use display: grid on parent element and put descendants, into the same row and column.Please check example below, based on Your HTML. I added only <span> and some colors, so You can see the result.You can also easily change z-index each of descendant elements, to manipulate its visibility (which one should be on top). Great answer, "mu is too short".

I was seeking the exact same thing, and after reading your post I found a solution that fitted my problem.I was having two elements of the exact same size and wanted to stack them.

As each have same size, what I could do was to makeon only the last element. This way the first element is inserted correctly, "pushing" the parents height, and the second element is placed on top.Hopes this helps other people trying to stacking 2+ elements with same (unknown) height.I had to set Container_height = Element1_height = Element2_heightUse can use z-index to set which one to be on top.Here's another solution using display: flex instead of position: absolute or display: grid.Due to absolute positioning removing the elements from the document flow position: absolute is not the right tool for the job. Depending on the exact layout you want to create you will be successful using negative margins, position:relative or maybe even transform: translate.

Show us a sample of what you want to do we can help you better.Of course, the problem is all about getting your height back. But how can you do that if you don't know the height ahead of time? Well, if you know what aspect ratio you want to give the container (and keep it responsive), you can get your height back by adding padding to another child of the container, expressed as a percentage.You can even add a dummy div to the container and set something like padding-top: 56.25% to give the dummy element a height that is a proportion of the container's width. This will push out the container and give it an aspect ratio, in this case 16:9 (56.25%).Padding and margin use the percentage of the width, that's really the trick here.After much testing, I have verified that the original question is already right; missing just a couple of settings:Here's some reusable css that will preserve the height of each element without using position: absolute:The first element in your stack is the background, and the second is the foreground.

What is the difference between a pseudo-class and a pseudo-element in CSS?

[What is the difference between a pseudo-class and a pseudo-element in CSS?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8069973/what-is-the-difference-between-a-pseudo-class-and-a-pseudo-element-in-css)

Things like a:link or div::after...Information on the difference seems scarce.

2011-11-09 18:48:34Z

Things like a:link or div::after...Information on the difference seems scarce.The CSS 3 selector recommendation is pretty clear about both, but I'll try to show the differences anyway.SourceThe important nature of pseudo-classes is stated in the very first sentence: "the pseudo-class concept [...] permit selection". It enables the author of an stylesheet to differ between elements based on information that "lies outside of the document tree", for example the current status of a link (:active,:visited). Those aren't saved anywhere in the DOM, and there exists no DOM interface to access these options.On the other hand, :target could be accessed via DOM manipulation (you could use window.location.hash in order to find the object with JavaScript), but this  "cannot be expressed using the other simple selectors".So basically a pseudo-class will refine the set of selected elements as any other simple selector in a sequence of simple selectors. Note that all simple selectors in a sequence of simple selectors will be evaluated at the same time. For a complete list of pseudo-class check the CSS3 selector recommendation.The following example will color all even rows gray (#ccc), all uneven rows which aren't dividable by 5 white and every other row magenta.SourceThe most important part here is that "pseudo-elements allow authors to refer to [..] otherwise inaccessible information" and that they "may also provide authors a way to refer to content that does not exist in the source document (e.g., the ::before and ::after pseudo-elements give access to generated content).". The biggest difference is that they actually create a new virtual element on which rules and even pseudo-class selectors can be applied to. They don't filter elements, they basically filter content (::first-line,::first-letter) and wrap it in a virtual container, which the author can style however he want (well, almost).For example the ::first-line pseudo-element cannot be reconstructed with JavaScript, as it heavily depends on the current used font, the fonts size, the elements width, floating elements (and probably the time of the day). Well, that's not entirely true: one could still calculate all those values and extract the first line, however doing so is a very cumbersome activity.I guess the biggest difference is that "only one pseudo-element may appear per selector". The note says that this could be subject to change, but as of 2012 I don't believe we see any different behavior in the future (it's still in CSS4).The following example will add a language-tag to every quote on a given page using the pseudo-class :lang and the pseudo-element ::after:Pseudo-classes act as simple selectors in a sequence of selectors and thereby classify elements on non-presentational characteristics, pseudo-elements create new virtual elements.A pseudo-class filters existing elements.

a:link means all <a>s that are :link.A pseudo-element is a new fake element.

div::after means non-existing elements after <div>s.::selection is another example of a pseudo-element.

It doesn't mean all elements that are selected; it means the range of content that is selected, which may span portions of multiple elements.Short description that helped me to understand the difference:From the Sitepoint docs:A conceptual answer:Below is the simple answer:We use pseudo-class when we need to apply css based on the state of an element. Such as:We use pseudo-element when we need to apply css to the specific parts of an elements or a newly inserted content. Such as:Below is the example of both:Pseudo-ClassA pseudo-class is way of selecting certain parts of a HTML document, based in principle not on the HTML document tree itself and its elements or on characteristics like name, attributes or contents, but on other phantom conditions like language encoding or the dynamic state of an element.The original pseudo-class defined dynamic states of an element that are entered and exited over time, or through user intervention. CSS2 expanded on this concept to include virtual conceptual document components or inferred portions of the document tree e.g. first-child. Pseudo-classes operate as if phantom classes were added to various elements.RESTRICTIONS: Unlike pseudo-elements, pseudo-classes can appear anywhere in selector chain.Example pseudo-class code:A page that demonstrates a rendering of the above pseudo-class codePseudo-elementsPSEUDO-ELEMENTS are used to address sub-parts of elements. They allow you to set style on a part of an element's content beyond what is specified in the documents. In other words they allow logical elements to be defined which are not actually in the document element tree. Logical elements allow implied semantic structure to be addressed in CSS selectors.RESTRICTIONS: Pseudo-elements may only be applied to external and document-level contexts - not to in-line styles. Pseudo-elements are restricted in where they can appear in a rule. They may only appear at the end of a selector chain (after the subject of the selector). They should come after any class or ID names found in the selector. Only one pseudo-element can be specified per selector. To address multiple pseudo-elements on a single element structure, multiple style selector/declaration statements must be made.Pseudo-elements can be used for common typographic effects such as initial caps and drop caps. They can also address generated content that is not in the source document (with the "before" and "after") An example style sheet of some pseudo-elements with properties and values added follows./* The following rule selects the first letter of a heading 1 and sets the font to 2em, cursive, with a green background. First-letter selects the first rendered letter/character for a block-level element. */Sources:LinkIn brief, from Pseudo-classes on MDN:And, from Pseudo-elements on MDN:

I'd like everything behind the div the be blurred, like this:Here is a jsfiddle which doesn't work: http://jsfiddle.net/u2y2091z/Any ideas how to make this work? I'd like to keep this as uncomplicated as possible and have it be cross-browser. Here is the CSS I'm using:Here is an example that uses svg filter.The idea is to use an svg element with height same as the #overlay and apply the feGaussianblur filter on it. This filter is applied on an svg image element. To give it an extruded effect, you could use a box-shadow at the bottom of the overlay.Browser Support for svg filters.I was able to piece together information from everyone here and further Googling, and I came up with the following which works in Chrome and Firefox: http://jsfiddle.net/xtbmpcsu/. I'm still working on making this work for IE and Opera.The key is putting the content inside of the div to which the filter is applied:And then the CSS:So mask has the filters applied. Also, note the use of url() for a filter with an <svg> tag for the value -- that idea came from http://codepen.io/AmeliaBR/pen/xGuBr. If you happen to minify your CSS, you might need to replace any spaces in the SVG filter markup with "%20".So now, everything inside the mask div is blurred.For a more simple and up to date answer:Note browser support is not perfect but in most cases a blur would be non essential.If you're looking for a reliable cross-browser approach today, you won't find a great one. The best option you have is to create two images (this could be automated in some environments), and arrange them such that one overlays the other. I've created a simple example below:Though effective, even this approach isn't necessarily ideal. That being said, it does yield the desired result.Here's a possible solution.HTMLCSSI know the CSS can be simplified and you probably should get rid of the ids. The idea here is to use a div as a cropping container and then apply blur on duplicate of the image. FiddleTo make this work in Firefox, you would have to use SVG hack.Instead of adding another blur background to your content,

you can use backdrop-filter. FYI IE 11 and Firefox may not support it. Check caniuse.Demo:I came up with this solution. Click to view image of blurry effectIt is kind of a trick which uses an absolutely positioned child div, sets its background image same as the parent div and then uses the background-attachment:fixed CSS property together with the same background properties set on the parent element.Then you apply filter:blur(10px) (or any value) on the child div.view on codepenHere's a solution that works with fixed backgrounds, if you have a fixed background and you have some overlayed elements and you need blured backgrounds for them, this solution works: Image we have this simple HTML:A fixed background for <body> or the wrapper element:And here for example we have a overlayed element with a white transparent background:Now we need to use the exact same background image of our wrapper for our overlay elements too, i use it as a :before psuedo-class:Since the fixed background works in a same way in both wrapper and overlayed elements, we have the background in exactly same scroll position of the overlayed element and we can simply blur it.

Here's a working fiddle, tested in Firefox, Chrome, Opera and Edge: https://jsfiddle.net/0vL2rc4d/NOTE: In firefox there's a bug that makes screen flicker when scrolling and there are fixed blurred backgrounds. if there's any fix, let me know

How to put spacing between TBODY elements

I have a table like this:I'd like to put some spacing between each tbody element, but padding and margin have no effect. Any ideas?

I have a table like this:I'd like to put some spacing between each tbody element, but padding and margin have no effect. Any ideas?Try this, if you don't mind not having borders.Something like this will work, depending on your browser support requirements:People will always have controversial opinions about using empty table elements to layout a page (as evidenced by this answer's downvote).  I recognize this, but sometimes its easier to use them this way when you are working in a "quick and dirty" way.  I've used empty rows in past projects to space groups of table rows.  I assigned the spacer rows a css class of their own and defined a height for that class that acted as a top and bottom margin for that group of table rows.  If you don't have borders on your table cells, you could also define a height to your typical cell or row in your style sheet that evenly spaces out all rows of your table.I had been in trouble spacing properly multiple <tbody> with ::before pseudo, in presence of <tr> containing <td> with rowspan in a couple of browsers.Basically, if you have a <tbody> structured like this:And you follow who advises to write css on ::before pseudo element like this:This will affect the rowspan, making table "losing" within the second <tr> how many <td>-rowspan are present in the first one.So, if anyone encounters that type of problem, the solution is to style ::before pseudo in this way:Here's a fiddleHere's another possibility that relies on :first-child which is not available in all browsers:Just set display as block and it will work.Of all of the answers given above, only djenson47's answers retain separation of presentation and content. The drawback of the collapsed border model method is that you can no longer use the table's border or cellspacing attributes to separate the individual cells. You could argue that this is a good thing, and there are some workarounds, but it can be a pain. So I think the first-child method is the most elegant.Alternatively, you could also set your TBODY class' overflow property to anything other than "visible." This method allows you to retain a separated borders model as well:Because padding can be applied to TD's, you can do a trick with the + sign. Then it will be possible to give a top padding to the TD's of the first TR of a tbody:I have added the "tbody + tbody" so the first tbody won't have a top padding. However, it's not required.As far as I know there are no drawbacks :), though didn't test the older browsers.You can use border-spacing in a table with table row groups to add a space between those groups. Though, I don't think there is a way to specify which groups are spaced and which are not.CSSYou can use as many <tbody> tags as you like. I didn't realize that was ok by W3C until now. Not to say my below solution doesn't work (it does), but to do what you're trying to do, assign your <tbody> tags classes and then reference their individual <td> tags through CSS like so:and your HTML thusly:Try that guy out :)whatever you do, DON'T insert blank rows...you shouldn't have more than 1 tbody element in your table. what you can do is set the class or id attribute in your <tr> elements and give their corresponding <td> tags padding:You can even assign the top and bottom <tr>'s an additional class so that they only do top or bottom padding, respectively:and in your HTML, your <tr> tag would look like this:Hope this helps!djensen47 answer works great for newer browsers, however, as it was pointed out, IE7 it does not work in.My workaround for this issue to support the older browsers was to wrap each cells contents inside a div.  Then add a margin-top to the div.CSSThe height setting keeps the cells at least 30px high to prevent any cell coloring used inside the div from collapsing around the text.  The margin-top creates the desired space by making the entire row taller.Came across this while trying to solve it myself. I had success with putting a <br> tag right before the closing </tbody> tag. It is a purely visual fix, but seems to work on most browsers I tested.Should be accessible as well.

How to override the properties of a CSS class using another CSS class

Assuming you havee.g. any of the following would override it:The first two「win」by selector specificity; the third one wins by !important, a blunt instrument.You could also organize your style sheets so that e.g. the rulewins simply by order, i.e. by being after an otherwise equally「powerful」rule. But this imposes restrictions and requires you to be careful in any reorganization of style sheets.These are all examples of the CSS Cascade, a crucial but widely misunderstood concept. It defines the exact rules for resolving conflicts between style sheet rules.P.S. I used left and background-none as they were used in the question. They are examples of class names that should not be used, since they reflect specific rendering and not structural or semantic roles.Just use !important it will help to override Take a look at this : when-using-important-is-the-right-choiceAs an alternative to the important keyword, you could make the selector more specific,

for example:(Note: no space between the class names).In this case, the rule will apply when both .left and .background-none are listed in the class attribute (regardless of the order or proximity).You should override by increasing Specificity of your styling. There are different ways of increasing the Specificity. Usage of !important which effects specificity, is a bad practice because it breaks natural cascading in your style sheet. Following diagram taken from css-tricks.com will help you produce right specificity for your element based on a points structure. Whichever specificity has higher points, will win. Sounds like a game - doesn't it?Checkout sample calculations here on css-tricks.com. This will help you understand the concept very well and it will only take 2 minutes. If you then like to produce and/or compare different specificities by yourself, try this Specificity Calculator: https://specificity.keegan.st/ or you can just use traditional paper/pencil.  For further reading try MDN Web Docs.All the best for not using !important.If you list the bakground-none class after the other classes, its properties will override those already set. There is no need to use !important here.For example:andThe link will not have a red background. Please note that this only overrides properties that have a selector that is less or equally specific.LIFO is the way browser parses CSS properties..If you are using Sass declare a variable called as use it instead of directly assigning values like red or blue.

When you want to override just reassign the value to thenit should smoothly override. Using "!important" is not always the right choice..Its just a hotfix

Anyone see any errors with my file structure?You need to have a 'static' folder setup (for css/js files) unless you specifically override it during Flask initialization. I am assuming you did not override it. Your directory structure for css should be like:Notice that your /styles directory should be under /staticThen, do thisFlask will now look for the css file under static/styles/mainpage.cssIn jinja2 templates (which flask uses), useThe static files are usually in the static folder, though, unless configured otherwise.I have read multiple threads and none of them fixed the issue that people are describing and I have experienced too.I have even tried to move away from conda and use pip, to upgrade to python 3.7, i have tried all coding proposed and none of them fixed. And here is why (the problem):by default python/flask search the static and the template in a folder structure like: you can verify by yourself using the debugger on Pycharm (or anything else) and check the values on the app (app = Flask(name)) and search for teamplate_folder and static_folderin order to fix this, you have to specify the values when creating the app something like this: the path TEMPLATE_DIR and STATIC_DIR depend on where the file app is located. in my case, see the picture, it was located within a folder under src.you can change the template and static folders as you wish and register on the app = Flask...In truth, I have started experiencing the problem when messing around with folder and at times worked at times not. this fixes the problem once and for allthe html code looks like this:         This the codeHere the structure of the foldersI'm running version 1.0.2 of flask right now.

The above file structures did not work for me, but I found one that did, which are as follows:(Please note that 'static' and 'templates' are folders, which should be named exactly the same thing.)To check what version of flask you are running, you should open Python in terminal and type the following accordingly:The flask project structure is different. As you mentioned in question the project structure is the same but the only problem is wit the styles folder. Styles folder must come within the static folder.Still having problems after following the solution provided by codegeek:  <link rel= "stylesheet" type= "text/css" href= "{{ url_for('static',filename='styles/mainpage.css') }}"> ?In Google Chrome pressing the reload button (F5) will not reload the static files. If you have followed the accepted solution but still don't see the changes you have made to CSS, then press ctrl + shift + R to ignore cached files and reload the static files.In Firefox pressing the reload button appears to reload the static files.In Edge pressing the refresh button does not reload the static file. Pressing ctrl + shift + R is supposed to ignore cached files and reload the static files. However this does not work on my computer.

Is it possible to use CSS to disable autocomplete on a form element (specifically a textfield)?I use a tag library which does not permit the autocomplete element and I would like to disable autocomplete without using Javascript.You can use a generated id and name everytime, which is different, so the browser cannot remember this text-field and will fail to suggest some values. This is at least the cross browser safe alternative, but I would recommend to go with the answer from RobertsonM (autocomplete="off").As it stands, there is no 'autocomplete off' attribute in CSS. However, html has an easy code for this:If you're looking for a site-wide effector, an easy one would be to simply have a js function to run through all 'input' s and add this tag, or look for the corresponding css class / id.The autocomplete attribute works fine in Chrome and Firefox (!), but see also Is there a W3C valid way to disable autocomplete in a HTML form?you can easily implement by jQueryIf you're using a form you can disable all the autocompletes with,CSS does not have this ability.

I thought someone with more css experience would know how to do this.As a note, there is another question about centering nav pills, which I tried, but it didn't work with just plain nav tabs.Thanks.nav-tabs list items are automatically floated to the left by the bootstrap so you have to reset that and instead display them as inline-block, and to center menu items we have to add the attribute of text-align:center to the container, like so:CSSDemo: http://jsfiddle.net/U8HGz/2/show/

Edit here: http://jsfiddle.net/U8HGz/2/Edit: patched version that works in IE7+ provided by user @My Head Hurts down in the comments below.Demo: http://jsfiddle.net/U8HGz/3/show/

Edit here: http://jsfiddle.net/U8HGz/3/Accepted answer is perfect. It can be further customized so that you can use it side by side with the standard left aligned tabs.To use it, add "centered" class to your tabs element Adding the class nav-justified works for me. This not only center aligns the tabs but it also spreads them nicely at the top.Even though the accepted answer works well, I found the above more natural to Bootstrap.Simply addingwhen I set up my tabs, worked for me.For e.g.You can just use bootstrap grid to center your nav-tabs. Since bootstrap grid is divided on 12 equals columns, you can easily use 4 columns for your navigation with 4 columns offset:<div class="col-sm-4 col-sm-offset-4">. Therefore your are getting your navigation in the middle of the page (also responsive solution) with 4 columns free on the left and the right side. I found grid really useful for making responsive web pages. 

Good luck! if you use bs4 simply you can add justify-content-center class to your nav-tabs to center it on page. if you want your tabs to be justified (full-with) add nav-justified class to it, in this case if you have 3 items in your nav each of them has 33% with. if 5 items is there each one have 20% with. another way is simply to add text-center if you are use bs3 .Try This:

So can I change the color of the bullets but not the text in some smart way?If you can use an image then you can do this. And without an image you won't be able to change the color of the bullets only and not the text.Using an imageSeelist-style-imageWithout using an imageThen you have to edit the HTML markup and include a span inside the list and color the li and span with different colors.I managed this without adding markup, but instead using li:before. This obviously has all the limitations of :before (no old IE support), but it seems to work with IE8, Firefox and Chrome after some very limited testing. The bullet style is also limited by what's in unicode.We can combine list-style-image with svgs, which we can inline in css! This method offers incredible control over the "bullets", which can become anything.To get a red circle, just use the following css:But this is just the beginning. This allows us to do any crazy thing we want with those bullets. circles or rectangles are easy, but anything you can draw with svg you can stick in there! Check out the bullseye example below: Some browsers require width and height attributes to be set on the <svg>, or they display nothing. At time of writing, recent versions of Firefox exhibit this problem. I've set both attributes in the examples.A recent comment reminded me of encodings for the data-uri. This was a pain-point for me recently, and I can share a bit of information I've researched.The data-uri spec, which references the URI spec, says that the svg should be encoded according to the URI spec. That means all sorts of characters should be encoded, eg < becomes %3C.Some sources suggest base64 encoding, which should fix encoding issues, however it will unnecessarily increase the size of the SVG, whereas URI encoding will not. I recommend URI encoding.browser-support: >ie8css tricks on svgsmdn on svgsBuilding off @Marc's solution -- since the bullet character is rendered differently with different fonts and browsers, I used the following css3 technique with border-radius to make a bullet that I have more control over:I know this is a really, really, old question but i was playing around with this and came up with a way i have not seen posted. Give the list a color and then overwrite the text color using ::first-line selector. I'm no expert so maybe there is something wrong with this approach that I'm missing, but it seems to work.Building off both @Marc and @jessica solutions - This is the solution that I use:I use em for font sizes so if you set your top value to be .5em it will always be placed to the mid point of your first line of text. I used left:-20px because that is the default position of bullets in browsers: parent  padding/2I really liked Marc's answer too - I needed a set of different colored ULs and obviously it would be easier just to use a class. Here is what I used for orange, for example:Plus, I found that the hex code I used for "content:" was different than Marc's (that hex circle seemed to sit a bit too high). The one I used seems to sit perfectly in the middle. I also found several other shapes (squares, triangles, circles, etc.) right hereFor me the best option is to use CSS pseudo elements, so for disc bullet styling it would look like that:

Notes:For more bullets styles you may use other css shapes https://css-tricks.com/examples/ShapesOfCSS/ (choose this which doesn't require pseudo elements to work, so for example triangles)You can use the ::marker CSS pseudo-element to select the marker box of a list item (i.e. bullets or numbers).Building on @ddilsaver's answer. I wanted to be able to use a sprite for the bullet. This appears to work:I tried this today and typed this:

I needed to display color markers in my lists (both bullets and numbers). I came upon this tip and wrote in in my stylesheet whith mutualization of the properties:I chose a different character to display a bullet, watching it here. I needed to adjust the margin accoardingly, maybe the values won't apply with the font you chose (the numbers use your webfont).Try using this instead:

If you find that it's not possible, or not reliable in all of your target browsers, you could try using a stretched img tag with z-index set lower, and position set to absolute so that other content appears on top of it.Let us know what you end up doing.Edit: What I suggested is basically what's in gabriel's link.  So try that :)To expand on @PhiLho answer, you can center a very large image (or any size image) on a page with: Or you could use a smaller image with a background color that matches the background of the image (if it is a solid color). This may or may not suit your purposes.If you need to stretch your background image while resizing the screen and you don't need compatibility with older browser versions this will do the work:If you have a large landscape image, this example here resizes the background in portrait mode, so that it displays on top, leaving blank on the bottom:The following code I use mostly for achieving the asked effect:You cannot in pure CSS.

I have been attempting to split a div into two columns using CSS, but I have not managed to get it working yet.  My basic structure is as follows:If I attempt to float the right and left divs to their respective positions (right and left), it seems to ignore the content div's background-color.  And other code that I have tried from various websites doesn't seem to be able to translate to my structure.Thanks for any help!When you float those two divs, the content div collapses to zero height.  Just addafter the #right div but inside the content div.  That will force the content div to surround the two internal, floating divs.This works good for me. I have divided the screen into two halfs: 20% and 80%:Another way to do this is to add overflow:hidden; to the parent element of the floated elements.overflow:hidden will make the element grow to fit in floated elements.This way, it can all be done in css rather than adding another html element.The most flexible way to do this:This acts exactly the same as appending the element to #content:but without actually adding an element. ::after is called a pseudo element. The only reason this is better than adding overflow:hidden; to #content is that you can have absolute positioned child elements overflow and still be visible. Also it will allow box-shadow's to still be visible.For whatever reason I've never liked the clearing approaches, I rely on floats and percentage widths for things like this.Here's something that works in simple cases:If you put some content in you'll see that it works:You can see it here: http://cssdesk.com/d64uyMake children divs inline-block and they will position side by side:See DemoNone of the answers given answer the original question.The question is how to separate a div into 2 columns using css.All of the above answers actually embed 2 divs into a single div in order to simulate 2 columns.  This is a bad idea because you won't be able to flow content into the 2 columns in any dynamic fashion.So, instead of the above, use a single div that is defined to contain 2 columns using CSS as follows...assign the above as a class to a div, and it will actually flow its contents into the 2 columns.  You can go further and define gaps between margins as well.  Depending on the content of the div, you may need to mess with the word break values so your content doesn't get cut up between the columns.Best way to divide a div vertically --I know this post is old, but if any of you still looking for a simpler solution. Floats don't affect the flow. What I tend to do is add aat the end of the 'wrapping div' (in this case content). I can justify this on a semantic basis by saying that such a paragraph might be needed. Another approach is to use a clearfix CSS:The trickery with the comments is for cross-browser compatibility.You can use flexbox to control the layout of your div element:This is best answered here Question 211383These days, any self-respecting person should be using the stated "micro-clearfix" approach of clearing floats.*In Safari you may need to set 49% to make it works.Divide a division in two columns is very easy, just specify the width of your column better if you put this (like width:50%) and set the float:left for left column and float:right for right column.

Can I somehow fix this (remove this transparency in Safari)?Phone and Tablet webkit browsers (Safari and Chrome) and desktop IE have a number of default changes to disabled form elements that you'll need to override if you want to style disabled inputs.it's an interesting question and I've tried plenty of overrides to see if I can get it going, but nothing's working.  Modern browsers actually use their own style sheets to tell elements how to display, so maybe if you can sniff out Chrome's stylesheet you can see what styles they're forcing on to it. I'll be very interested in the result and if you don't have one I'll spend a little time myself looking for it later when I have some time to waste.FYI,doesn't override it, so I'm not sure it's opacity.You could change color to #440000 just for Safari, but IMHO the best solution would be not to change looks of button at all. This way, in every browser on every platform, it will look just like users expect it to.UPDATED 2019:Combining ideas from this page into a "set and forget" solution.You can use the readonly attribute instead of the disabled attribute, but then you will need to add a class because there isn't a pseudo-class input:readonly.Beware that a disabled input and readonly input aren't the same.

A readonly input can have focus, and will send values on submit. Look at w3.orgfor @ryanI wanted my disabled input box to look like a normal one. This is the only thing that would work in Safari Mobile.If you want to fix the problem for all the disabled inputs, you can define -webkit-text-fill-color to currentcolor, so the color property of the input will be used.See that fiddle on Safari

as @Nick Shvelidze pointed out, you should consider adding pointer-events: noneAdded vmax value for box-shadow as @Prinzhorn suggestedYou can create an SVG which is filled with a path that has the hole where you need it to. But I guess than you need to find a way to handle clicks, since all of them will be targeted to the overlaid svg. I thing document.getElementFromPoint can help you here. mdnThis can also be done similarly to @VilleKoo's answer, but with a border.You can achieve the same as in VilleKoo's answer using CSS outline property. It has excellent browser support (and works also in IE8+). Outlines have the same syntax as borders, but unlike border they don't take up space, they are drawn above the content.Also for IE9+ you can replace 99999px with calc(100 * (1vh + 1vw - 1vmin)).Disadvantage of this approach is that outline is not affected by border-radius.Demo:Here is simple jQuery code using @VilleKoo css

The clearfix class looks like this:I found that if I don't use clearfix when I use the bottom-border property, the border would show above the child divs. Can someone explain what the clearfix class does? Also, why are there two display properties? That seems very strange to me. I am especially curious about what the content:'.' means.Thanks,GWhen floating elements exist on the page, non-floating elements wrap around the floating elements, similar to how text goes around a picture in a newspaper. From a document perspective (the original purpose of HTML), this is how floats work.Before the invention of display:inline-block, websites use float to set elements beside each other. float is preferred over display:inline since with the latter, you can't set the element's dimensions (width and height) as well as vertical paddings (top and bottom) - which floated elements can do since they're treated as block elements.The main problem is that we're using float against its intended purpose.Another is that while float allows side-by-side block-level elements, floats do not impart shape to its container. It's like position:absolute, where the element is "taken out of the layout". For instance, when an empty container contains a floating 100px x 100px <div>, the <div> will not impart 100px in height to the container.Unlike position:absolute, it affects the content that surrounds it. Content after the floated element will "wrap" around the element. It starts by rendering beside it and then below it, like how newspaper text would flow around an image.What clearfix does is to force content after the floats or the container containing the floats to render below it. There are a lot of versions for clear-fix, but it got its name from the version that's commonly being used - the one that uses the CSS property clear.Here are several ways to do clearfix , depending on the browser and use case. One only needs to know how to use the clear property in CSS and how floats render in each browser in order to achieve a perfect cross-browser clear-fix.Your provided style is a form of clearfix with backwards compatibility. I found an article about this clearfix. It turns out, it's an OLD clearfix - still catering the old browsers. There is a newer, cleaner version of it in the article also. Here's the breakdown:All in all, these 3 rules keep the .clearfix working cross-browser, with old browsers in mind.When an element, such as a div is floated, its parent container no longer considers its height, i.e. The parent container will not be be 40 pixels tall by default. This causes a lot of weird little quirks if you're using these containers to structure layout. So the clearfix class that various frameworks use fixes this problem by making the parent container "acknowledge" the contained elements. Day to day, I normally just use frameworks such as 960gs, Twitter Bootstrap for laying out and not bothering with the exact mechanics.Can read more herehttp://www.webtoolkit.info/css-clearfix.htmlclearfix is the same as overflow:hidden. Both clear floated children of the parent, but clearfix will not cut off the element which overflow to it's parent.

It also works in IE8 & above.There is no need to define "." in content & .clearfix. Just write like this:HTMLRead these links for morehttp://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/clear-fix/,What methods of ‘clearfix’ can I use?

Maybe the jQuery UI Pulsate Effect is more appropriate, see hereEdit #2:

To adjust the opacity you could do this:...so it won't go any lower than 50% opacity.Take a look at http://jqueryui.com/demos/effect/.

Also note that if you put this code in a for loop you can have 1 milion pulses so therefore you are not restricted to the default 6 or how much the default is.EDIT:

Adding this as a global jQuery functionBlink any element easily from your site using the followingYou may want to look into jQuery UI.

You can see what I mean by hovering on the shape in the below snippet.How can I create this shape with a slanted side and also be able to support dynamic sizes?There are many ways to create the shape with a slanted edge only on one side. The following methods cannot support dynamic sizes as already mentioned in the question:The methods that can support dynamic sizes are described below.(Browser Compatibility)SVG can be used to produce the shape either by using polygons or paths. The below snippet makes use of polygon. Any text content required can be positioned on top of the shape.Pros Cons (Browser Compatibility)Linear gradients can still be used to produce the shape but not with angles as mentioned in the question. We have to use the to [side] [side] syntax (thanks to vals) instead of specifying angles.  When sides are specified, the gradient angles are automatically adjusted based on the container's dimensions.Pros Cons (Browser Compatibility)In this method, a pseudo-element is added, skewed and positioned in such a way that it looks like one of the edges is slanted/angled.If the top or bottom edge is slanted, the skew should be along Y axis, else the rotation should be along X axis. The transform-origin should have the side opposite to the slanted side.Pros Cons (Browser Compatibility)In this method, the main container is rotated along the X or Y axis with a bit of perspective. Setting the appropriate value to transform-origin would produce a slanted edge on only one side. If the top or bottom side is slanted, the rotation should be along Y axis, else the rotation should be along X axis. The transform-origin should have the side opposite to the slanted side.Pros Cons (Browser Compatibility)In this method, the main container is clipped into the required shape using a polygon. The polygon's points should be modified depending on the side where the slanted edge is required.Pros Cons (Browser Compatibility)Canvas can also be used to produce the shape by drawing paths. The below snippet has a demo. Any text content required can be positioned on top of the shape.Pros Cons * - Avoiding pixelation would need repaints of the shape whenever viewport is resized. There is an example of it here but that is an overhead.(Browser Compatibility)Viewport Units are a great innovation in CSS3. While you can usually use percentage values to dynamize your properties, you can't do it for border-widths (nor for font-sizes). With Viewport Units instead you can dynamically set your border widths, along with the sizes of your objects, compared to the viewport dimension. Note: percentage values are referred to the parent object, not to the viewport (visible area of the window).To test the method, launch the following snippet Full Page and resize it both horizontally and vertically.Pros - (1) Everything is dynamic, browser coverage is wide.Cons - (1) You should pay attention at how your OS handles the scrollbar with overflow: auto;.My solution is inspired by the one called Method 7 - Viewport Units by Andrea Ligios, above in this page.I used the "horizontal" unit for the height too (height:10vw) to keep the given proportions in the trapezoid when resizing the width of the navigation window. We could call this Method 7b - Viewport Width.Further, using two nested divs, instead of one and the :after selector, allows a better tuning of the text content styles, in my opinion (e.g. text-align, etc.).

If I convert an image (jpg or png) to base64, then will it be bigger, or will it have the same size? How much greater will it be?Is it recommended to use base64 encoded images on my website?It will be approximately 37% larger:Source: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base64Here's a really helpful overview of when to base64 encode and when not to  by David Calhoun.Basic answer = gzipped base64 encoded files will be roughly comparable in file size to standard binary (jpg/png).  Gzip'd binary files will have a smaller file size.Takeaway = There's some advantage to encoding and gzipping your UI icons, etc, but unwise to do this for larger images.It will be bigger in base64.Base64 uses 6 bits per byte to encode data, whereas binary uses 8 bits per byte.  Also, there is a little padding overhead with Base64.  Not all bits are used with Base64 because it was developed in the first place to encode binary data on systems that can only correctly process non-binary data.That means that the encoded image will be around 25% larger, plus constant overhead for the padding.Encoding an image to base64 will make it about 30% bigger.See the details in the wikipedia article about the Data URI scheme, where it states:The answer is: It depends.Although base64-images are larger, there a few conditions where base64 is the better choice.Size of base64-imagesBase64 uses 64 different characters and this is 2^6. So base64 stores 6bit per 8bit character. So the proportion is 6/8 from unconverted data to base64 data. This is no exact calculation, but a rough estimate.Example:An 48kb image needs around 64kb as base64 converted image.Calculation: (48 / 6) * 8 = 64Simple CLI calculator on Linux systems:Or using an image:Base64-images and websitesThis question is much more difficult to answer. Generally speaking, as larger the image as less sense using base64. But consider the following points:It will definitely cost you more space & bandwidth if you want to use base64 encoded images. However if your site has a lot of small images you can decrease the page loading time by encoding your images to base64 and placing them into html. In this way, the client browser wont need to make a lot of connections to the images, but will have them in html.

I'm trying to make a live, in-page css editor with a preview function that would reload the stylesheet and apply it without needing to reload the page. What would be the best way to go about this?On the "edit" page, instead of including your CSS in the normal way (with a <link> tag), write it all to a <style> tag. Editing the innerHTML property of that will automatically update the page, even without a round-trip to the server.The Javascript, using jQuery:And that should be it!If you wanted to be really fancy, attach the function to the keydown on the textarea, though you could get some unwanted side-effects (the page would be changing constantly as you type)Edit: tested and works (in Firefox 3.5, at least, though should be fine with other browsers). See demo here: http://jsbin.com/owapiPossibly not applicable for your situation, but here's the jQuery function I use for reloading external stylesheets:Check out Andrew Davey's snazzy Vogue project - http://aboutcode.net/vogue/There is absolutely no need to use jQuery for this. The following JavaScript function will reload all your CSS files:One more jQuery solutionFor a single stylesheet with id "css" try this:Wrap it in a function that has global scrope and you can use it from the Developer Console in Chrome or Firebug in Firefox:A shorter version in Vanilla JS and in one line:Or expanded:Based on previous solutions, I have created bookmark with JavaScript code:Image from Firefox: What does it do?It reloads CSS by adding query string params (as solutions above):Yes, reload the css tag. And remember to make the new url unique (usually by appending a random query parameter). I have code to do this but not with me right now. Will edit later...edit: too late... harto and nickf beat me to it ;-)i now have this:make any element in your page with id changeCss with a href attribute with the new css url in it. and a link element with the starting css:Another answer:

There's a bookmarklet called ReCSS. I haven't used it extensively, but seems to work.There's a bookmarklet on that page to drag and drop onto your address bar (Can't seem to make one here). In case that's broke, here's the code:simple if u are using php

Just append the current time at the end of the css like So now everytime u reload whatever it is , the time changes and browser thinks its a different file since the last bit keeps changing.... U can do this for any file u force the browser to always refresh using whatever scripting language u wantIn a simple manner you can use rel="preload" instead of rel="stylesheet" .Since this question was shown in the stackoverflow in 2019, I'd like to add my contribution using a more modern JavaScript.Specifically, for CSS Stylesheet that are not inline – since that is already covered from the original question, somehow.First of all, notice that we still don't have Constructable Stylesheet Objects.

Is it possible to show and hide text using a link with only CSS -- without using JavaScript at all?For example: On this pageNote the "More" link. When you click it, it unhides text. This particular example is JavaScript, but I am not sure if it can be done with pure CSS.There’s the <details> element, which isn’t yet built into Edge:I’m not sure how hard it is to style consistently across browsers.There’s a common checkbox hack (where the checkbox can be hidden and the label can be styled to look like anything):but it’s not always (maybe ever? hmm) appropriate to use it; you can usually just fall back on showing the content when JavaScript fails to load, and have the「more」link link to it.There’s also :target, but it’s probably even less appropriate, since it's harder to build in the closing mechanism.Yes, this is possible with pure CSS. You're able to click on an element by making use of a checkbox's :checked attribute in combination with a <label> element's for attribute.Because the checkbox can be unchecked, you can use this to toggle visibility by simply adding  visibility: hidden to an element stemming from :checked (once the checkbox is clicked again, this pseudo-selector will be invalid, and the CSS selector will no longer match the target).This can be extended to a <label> with use of the for attribute, so that you can completely hide the checkbox itself, and apply your own styling to the <label> directly.The following makes use of the adjacent sibling combinator (+) to toggle the class toggle when the <label> element is clicked:Yes, you can easily do this using CSS only. Please refer to the code below:You could hide a checkbox, but allow it to be checked/unchecked via its associated <label> element.Based on whether the checkbox is checked or not, you can hide/show the additional text, and even change the text of the label from "More" to "Less".I've included some additional details in the CSS so that each definition's intentions can be a bit more clear.1. With one toggle "More" / "Less" button:

2. With "More" button at the top and "Less" button at the bottom:Technically speaking, it is possible to toggle the visibility of text based on when you click on a button or link, as shown below:That being said, I do strongly recommend that you familiarize yourself with JavaScript as the solution using JavaScript for something like this is much simpler and allows for additional flexibility. Yes, you can do that by using HTML and CSS only.now you can hide/show text using only CSS too!

If you are using text input and want to show/hide text based on the state of the input box, you can use the new CSS pseudo-class :placeholder-shown for <input> or <textarea>.

Here is an example/demo of the above-mentioned pseudo-class!:Here is Link to MDN Docs.Maybe somebody will find this solution more intuitive and easier to implement. The mechanics of this is that the link targets itself and in that case it's easy to select anything what comes next in the DOM.Use "display: none;" attribute.

Thankshtml navbar:css for .icon-bar, since Bootstrap 4 doesn't use the icon-bar class.You can add the collapse component to the links like this..Demo using 'data-toggle' methodOr, (perhaps a better way) use jQuery like this..Demo using jQuery methodUpdate 2019 - Bootstrap 4The navbar has changed, but the "close after click" method is still the same:https://www.codeply.com/go/nFDHoEqqJQ (jQuery method)

Also opens submenu items.Maybe you have to tweak it a bit if your toggle class is different. I am using Angular 5 with Boostrap 4. It works for me in this way.The easiest way to do it using only Angular 2/4 template with no coding:This code simulates a click on the burguer button to close the navbar by clicking on a link in the menu, keeping the fade out effect. Solution with typescript for angular 7. Avoid routerLink problems.this is the solution to close menu when click on anchor then apply this line in list item the real example that work for me is belowu can use a simply bind on click and close, like this: (click)="drawer.close()

Also see different List-Item markers.http://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_ul.aspYou cannot. Whenever there is any style sheet being applied that assigns a property to an element, there is no way to get to the browser defaults, for any instance of the element.The (disputable) idea of reset.css is to get rid of browser defaults, so that you can start your own styling from a clean desk. No version of reset.css does that completely, but to the extent they do, the author using reset.css is supposed to completely define the rendering.You're resetting the margin on all elements in the second css block. Default margin is 40px - this should solve the problem: An answer for the future: CSS 4 will probably contain the revert keyword, which reverts a property to its value from the user or user-agent stylesheet [source]. As of writing this, only Safari supports this – check here for updates on browser support.In your case you would use:See also this other answer with some more details.

What do commas and spaces in multiple classes mean in CSS?

[What do commas and spaces in multiple classes mean in CSS?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3344284/what-do-commas-and-spaces-in-multiple-classes-mean-in-css)

Here is an example that I do not understand:It seems to me that width: 460px is applied to all above mentioned classes. But why some classes are separated by a comma (,), and some just by a space?I assume that width: 460px will be applied only to those elements which combine classes in the way mentioned in the CSS file. For example, it will be applied to <div class='container_12 grid_6'> but it will not be applied to the <div class='container_12'>. Is this assumption correct?

Here is an example that I do not understand:It seems to me that width: 460px is applied to all above mentioned classes. But why some classes are separated by a comma (,), and some just by a space?I assume that width: 460px will be applied only to those elements which combine classes in the way mentioned in the CSS file. For example, it will be applied to <div class='container_12 grid_6'> but it will not be applied to the <div class='container_12'>. Is this assumption correct?That says "make all .grid_6's within .container_12's and all .grid_8's within .container_16's 460 pixels wide." So both of the following will render the same:As for the commas, it's applying one rule to multiple classes, like this.It's functionally equivalent to:But cuts down on verbosity.This rule matches a DOM node with class container_12 that has a descendant (not necessarily a child) with class grid_6, and applies the CSS rules to the DOM element with class grid_6.Putting > between them says that the grid_6 node must be a direct child of the node with class container_12.A comma, as others have stated, is a way to apply rules to many different nodes at one time. In this case, the rules apply to any node with either a class of container_12 or grid_6.Not exactly what was asked, but maybe this will help.To apply a style to an element only if it has both classes your selector should use no space between the class names.For Example:Comma groups the classes (applies the same style to them all), an empty space tells that the following selector must be within the first selector.Thereforeapplies that style to only class .grid_6 which is within .container_12 class and to .grid_8 class which is within .container_16.The width: 460px; will be applied to the element with the .grid_8 class, contained inside the elements with .container_16 class, and elements with the .grid_6 class, contained inside the elements with .container_12.The space means heritage, and the comma means 'and'. If you put properties with a selector like

.class-a, .class-b, you will have the properties applied to the elements with anyone of the two classes.Hope I have helped.  You have four classes and two selectors in your example:So .container_12 and .grid_6 are both classes, but the rule width: 460px will only be applied to elements that have the .grid_6 class which are descendants of an element that have the .container_16 class.For example:The above means that you are applying styles to two classes, indicated by the comma.  When you see two elements side by side not separated you can assume that it is referring to an area within an area.  So in the above, this style only applies to grid_6 classes inside of container_12 classes and grid_8 classes inside of container_16 classes.in the example:The first grid_6 will not be effected while the second grid_6 class will because it is contained inside a container_12.A statement like Would only apply the bold to  tags within areas that have class "description" that are inside of an area with id "admin", such as:width:460px will be only applied to .grid_6 and .grid_8Edit: Here is a very good article for you http://css-tricks.com/multiple-class-id-selectors/Selectors combinations get different meanings - attached image explains easilya) Multiple selectors separated by a comma(「,」) - Same styles are applied to all selected elements. Here border style is applied to DIV elements and CSS class(.elmnt-color) applied elements.b) Multiple selectors separated by space – Those are called descendant selectors. }Here border style is applied to CSS class(.elmnt-color) applied elements which are child elements of DIV element.c) Multiple selectors specified without space - Here styles are applied to elements which meet all the combinations. Here border style is applied to CSS class(.elmnt-color) applied DIV elements only.Details are attached at https://www.csssolid.com/css-tips.htmlNote: CSS Class is one of the CSS Selector.

I have tried many techniques to no avail.To save you time don't even go down this route just use  sendMessages for cross domain communications.

There are plug ins for HTML < 5 that I use- Go to the bottom for a nice example :)Past few days I have been trying to integrate an iframe into a site. This is a short term solution while the other side develops and API(could take months...) 

And because this is as short term solution we done want to use easyXDM- I have access to the other domain but its difficult enough asking them to add p3p header as it is.....3 iframesThe closest solution I found was the 3 iframes- but it goes mental of chrome and safari so I cannot use that.open in chromehttp://css-tricks.com/examples/iFrameResize/crossdomain.php#frameId=frame-one&height=1179Measure the scrollbarsI found a another post on how to use the scrollheight to try and resize the form.. in theory it works well but I could not apply it properly using the iframes scroll height..

No need to include the easyxdm in each of these pages.I have modified the parameters it sends. If you want the width to work properly then the pages on the otherdomain need to include the width of the page in a style somwhere that look something similar to:This works great for me. If the width is not included then the frame behaves a bit strange and kind'of tries to guess what it should be .. and will not shrink down if you need it to.Modify the intermediate frame to poll for changesYour intermediate frame should look something like this..The interval could be made more efficient to chaeck if size has change and only send if the dimensions changes isntead of posting messaging every 500ms.

Works in IE8+.https://github.com/davidjbradshaw/iframe-resizerThe thing is - there is no other way than using Cross-Domain Messaging for this since you need to get the computed height from a document in one domain, to a document in a different domain.So, either you do this using postMessage (works in all moder browsers), or you spend 5 minutes adapting the resize iframe example from easyXDM. The other party really just needs to copy a few files onto their domain, and add a single line of code to their document..Similar to what Sean has mentioned, you can use postMessage. I've spent so much time trying different ways to resize iframe with cross-domain but no luck until I stumbled on this great blog post by David Walsh: http://davidwalsh.name/window-iframeThis is a combination of my code and David's solution. My solution is geared specifically toward resizing iframes.In the child page, find the height of the page and pass it to the parent page (which contains  the iframe). Replace element_id with your element id (html, body, whatever).On the parent window, add this code. Replace iframe_id with your iframe ID:If you open the console, you will see the height being printed in the console log. This will help you in debugging which is why I left it there. Best,

BakerHaving looked a lots of different solution to this I ended up writing a simple small library to take a account of a number of different use cases. As I needed a solution that supported multiple user generated iFrames on a portal page, supported browser resizes and could cope with the host page JavaScript loading after the iFrame. I also add support for sizing to width and a callback function and allow the override of the body.margin, as you will likely want to have this set to zero.https://github.com/davidjbradshaw/iframe-resizerThe iframe code is just a little self-contained JavaScript, so that it's a good guest on other people pages.The script is then initialised on the host page with the following available options. Instead of use scroll=no on the iframe, I change it to "auto". Then, I get the size of the actual window and use that as the iframe height attribute.Well, the result is...We will never have the "page" scroll, only the "iframe" scroll. When You navigate, doesn't matter who is the scroll, but the important is that there's only 1.Well, there's the problem of the user simply resize the window while he's navigating. To solve that, I use:Did You think that that solution will cause any bugs? It's working for me, and on the iFrame I had dynamic contect generated by php. I'm afraid of future bugs with that...Nowadays there is only 4 solutions I know:Only the third one can resolve many problems. For example you can create responsive iFrame; close it from inside or you can communicate with it. But to do that you need iFrame in Iframe and the "third party cookies" workaround (optional).I've created an article about it with example: Event-driven cross-domain iFrameHave you looked into the 'object-fit' HTML5 attributes? Scales video/images to the iframe, rather than scaling the iframe (nice if you grab a medium-sized image that ends up being 5,000px in width). The "fit" option (others are "cover" and "fill") uses a sort-of-letterbox approach to fit the source in while preserving the aspect ratios. For viewing by the HTML5-less out there, it looks like there a whoooole lot of polyfills available. This one is great, but a bug on Edge's end has kept it incompatible with Microsoft's New Nightmare for about a year, now: https://github.com/anselmh/object-fitEDIT: To get around cross domain issues, you can always just do the work in a Chrome Extension Content Script, since it thinks it's part of the page you're sticking your iframe on.HTTPS another link get height to iframe autoheighthttps://-a.com content:https://-b.com iframe content:Work Table:xcom http > ycom https WORKxcom https > ycom https WORKxcom http > ycom http WORKxcom https > ycom http WORKAre you looking to find the height of the page contained within the iframe?

Hence, the access denied error.To resize an iframe, here's a simple script:this goes in the head: (this was written for a php script, for html, change the ' to " and the \" to '...end of headthis goes in the body (remember, this was written for a php script, for html change all the ' to " and the \" to '...)bonus: there's some hints above. As it is set for php scripting, you can do a lot with it...to learn more, do more...the key to this is "sizeframe1" .... for multiple "resizers" on the same page, copy the same script but change the id in iframe and the name in the script in the head, and viola! you have multiple resizers on the same page...it works very well!have phun.

I would think of something like :Of course must have checked it already, but I found strange that you only use the transform property since CSS3 is not fully implemented everywhere. Maybe it would work better with the following considerations :EDIT :I came up with that fiddle :http://jsfiddle.net/JjHNG/35/Using minimal code. Is it approaching what you were expecting ?I don't think this is achievable using only CSS animations.  I am assuming that CSS transitions do not fulfil your use case, because (for example) you want to chain two animations together, use multiple stops, iterations, or in some other way exploit the additional power animations grant you.I've not found any way to trigger a CSS animation specifically on mouse-out without using JavaScript to attach "over" and "out" classes. Although you can use the base CSS declaration trigger an animation when the :hover ends, that same animation will then run on page load.  Using "over" and "out" classes you can split the definition into the base (load) declaration and the two animation-trigger declarations.The CSS for this solution would be:And using JavaScript (jQuery syntax) to bind the classes to the events:Its much easier than all this:  Simply transition the same property on your element https://codepen.io/lafland/pen/MoEaoG creating a reversed animation is kinda an overkill to a simple problem, what u need is however this wont work on its own because animation spec is so dump that they forgot to add a way to restart the animation so here is how you do it with the help of jsWould you be better off having just the one animation, but having it reverse?we can use requestAnimationFrame to reset animation and reverse it when browser paints in next frame.Also use onmouseenter and onmouseout event handlers to reverse animation directionAs perTry this:supported in Firefox 5+, IE 10+, Chrome, Safari 4+, Opera 12+Have tried several solutions here, nothing worked flawlessly; then Searched the web a bit more, to find GSAP at https://greensock.com/ (subject to license, but it's pretty permissive); once you reference the lib ...... you can go:And it will work flawlessly.

Understanding the grid classes ( col-sm-# and col-lg-# ) in Bootstrap 3

[Understanding the grid classes ( col-sm-# and col-lg-# ) in Bootstrap 3](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/18146775/understanding-the-grid-classes-col-sm-and-col-lg-in-bootstrap-3)

I'm getting started on Bootstrap 3 and I'm having some trouble understanding how the grid classes are meant to be used.Here's what I've figured out so far: It appears that the classes col-sm-# and col-lg-# differ from plain old col-# in that they will only apply when screens are above a certain size (768px and 992px respectively). If you omit the -sm- or -lg- the divs will never collapse into one column.However, when I create two divs inside a row that are both col-sm-6 it seems they are only side by side when the window is between 768px and 992px wide. In other words, if I shrink the window all the way down and then slowly widen it, the layout is single column, then two columns, then back to single column again.

In other words, if I shrink the window all the way down and then slowly widen it, the layout is single column, then two columns, then back to single column again.[UPDATE BELOW]I took another look at the docs and it appears I overlooked a section which talks specifically about this.The answers to my questions:Other than reading the docs too quickly, I think I was confused because I came into Bootstrap 3 with a "Bootstrap 2 mentality". Specifically, I was using the (optional) responsive styles (bootstrap-responsive.css) in v2 and v3 is quite different (for the better IMO).UPDATE for stable release:This question was originally written when RC1 was out. They made some major changes in RC2 so for anyone reading this now, not everything mentioned above still applies.As of when I'm currently writing this, the col-*-# classes DO seem to apply upwards. So for example, if you want an element to be 12 columns (full width) for phones, but two 6 columns (half page) for tablets and up, you would do something like this:(They also added an additional xs break point after this question was written.)Here you have a very good tutorial, that explains, how to use the new grid classes in Bootstrap 3.It also covers mixins etc.To amend SDP's answer above, you do NOT need to declarecol-xs-12 in <div class="col-xs-12 col-sm-6">. Bootstrap 3 is mobile-first, so every div column is assumed to be a 100% width div by default - which means at the "xs" size it is 100% width, it will always default to that behavior regardless of what you set at sm, md, lg. If you want your xs columns to be not 100%, then you normally do a col-xs-(1-11).This should be as simple as: No need to add the col-lg-6 too.Demo: http://www.bootply.com/73119The best way to understand is to simply think from top to bottom ( Large Desktops to Mobile Phones) Firstly, as B3 is mobile first so if you use xs then the columns will be same from Large desktops to xs ( i recommend using xs or sm as this will keep everything the way you want on every screen size )Secondly if you want to give different width to columns on different devices or resolutions, than you can add multiple classes e.gthe above will change the width according to the screen resolutions, REMEMBER i am keeping the total columns in each class = 12I hope my answer would help!

Is there a way to control the size of the radio button in CSS ?

2011-02-07 10:37:57Z

Is there a way to control the size of the radio button in CSS ?Yes, you should be able to set its height and width, as with any element. However, some browsers do not really take these properties into account.This demo gives an overview of what is possible and how it is displayed in various browsers: 

https://www.456bereastreet.com/lab/styling-form-controls-revisited/radio-button/As you'll see, styling radio buttons is not easy :-DA workaround is to use JavaScript and CSS to replace the radio buttons and other form elements with custom images:This css seems to do the trick:Setting the border to 0 seems to allow the user to change the size of the button and have the browser render it in that size for eg. the above height: 2em will render the button at twice the line height. This also works for checkboxes (input[type=checkbox]). Some browsers render better than others.From a windows box it works in IE8+, FF21+, Chrome29+.Old question but now there is a simple solution, compatible with most browsers, which is to use CSS3. I tested in IE, Firefox and Chrome and it works.Change the value 1.5, in this case an increment of 50% in size, according to your needs. If the ratio is very high, it can blur the radio button. The next image shows a ratio of 1.5.Not directly. In fact, form elements in general are either problematic or impossible to style using CSS alone. the best approach is to:javascripthtmlYou can control radio button's size with css style:style="height:35px; width:35px;"This directly controls the radio button size.Resizing the default widget doesn’t work in all browsers, but you can make custom radio buttons with JavaScript. One of the ways is to create hidden radio buttons and then place your own images on your page. Clicking on these images changes the images (replaces the clicked image with an image with a radio button in a selected state and replaces the other images with radio buttons in an unselected state) and selects the new radio button.Anyway, there is documentation on this subject. For example, read this: Styling Checkboxes and Radio Buttons with CSS and JavaScript.Here's one approach. By default the radio buttons were about twice as large as labels.

(See CSS and HTML code at end of answer)Safari: 10.0.3Chrome: 56.0.2924.87Firefox: 50.1.0Internet Explorer: 9 (Fuzziness not IE's fault, hosted test on netrenderer.com)CSS:HTML:Directly you can not do this. [As per my knowledge].You should use images to supplant the radio buttons. You can make them function in the same manner as the radio buttons inmost cases, and you can make them any size you want.You can also use the transform property, with required value in scale:This works fine for me in all browsers:(inline style for simplicity...)The size of both the radio button and text will change with the label's font-size.try this code... it may be the ans what you exactly looking for

It should be set, even if it is set to nothing.This won't show up:This will show up in the inspector:Hope it helps.After a lot of frustration, I figured out that firefox doesn't show the pseudo elements in the document tree at all, but if you select the exact element which has pseudo element(s) defined, then the styles for its pseudo element(s) are shown in the style rules section on the right side. This is true for both firebug and the built-in inspect ("Q"), and I am shocked that nobody bothered to explain this clearly before.Clearly, chrome/chromium's handling of pseudo elements is vastly superior, as they can be selected (both in the document tree and directly on the page) and inspected just like regular elements, with layout, properties and everything else, independent of their "owner".Browser versions I'm using currently: Chromium 40.0.2214.91, Firefox 31.3.0.Firefox has had this feature for awhile now, just right click, "inspect element", and see the before and after elements in the right panel of the inspector.

How can I include the content in the div tag on the same line - here is my code.I have tried to tidy it up here. How can I have this display on a single line?The div tag is a block element, causing that behavior.You should use a span element instead, which is inline.If you really want to use div, add style="display: inline".  (You can also put that in a CSS rule)I am not an expert but try white-space:nowrap; The white-space property is supported in all major browsers.Note: The value "inherit" is not supported in IE7 and earlier. IE8 requires a !DOCTYPE. IE9 supports "inherit".div is a block element, which always takes up its own line.use the span tag insteadAdd style="display: inline" to your div.use float:left on the div and the link, or use a span.You can simply use:

The code appears to work as intended, styles are being added, but transition only works in second case?Try setting a default value in the css (to let it know where you want it to start out)Perhaps you need to specify a top value in your css rule set, so that it will know what value to animate from.In my case div position was fixed , adding left position was not enough it started working only after adding display blockleft:0;

 display:block;Something that is not relevant for the OP, but maybe for someone else in the future:For pixels (px), if the value is "0", the unit can be omitted: right: 0 and right: 0px both work.However I noticed that in Firefox and Chrome this is not the case for the seconds unit (s). While transition: right 1s ease 0s works, transition: right 1s ease 0 (missing unit s for last value transition-delay) does not (it does work in Edge however).In the following example, you'll see that right works for both 0px and 0, but transition only works for 0s and it doesn't work with 0.I ran into this issue today. Here is my hacky solution. I needed a fixed position element to transition up by 100 pixels as it loaded.

difference between width auto and width 100 percent

Previously my assumption about the width auto works as if its contents are but now with a little knowledge no it works as if its block full width. So I'm confused here with the width 100% and the width auto. Can anyone please describe me about differences between these with explanation?Width autoWidth 100%To visualise the difference see this picture:Source

It's about margins and border. If you use width: auto, then add border, your div won't become bigger than its container. On the other hand, if you use width: 100% and some border, the element's width will be 100% + border or margin. For more info see this.As long as the value of width is auto, the element can have horizontal margin, padding and border without becoming wider than its container (unless of course the sum of margin-left + border-left-width + padding-left + padding-right + border-right-width + margin-right is larger than the container). The width of its content box will be whatever is left when the margin, padding and border have been subtracted from the container’s width.On the other hand, if you specify width:100%, the element’s total width will be 100% of its containing block plus any horizontal margin, padding and border (unless you’ve used box-sizing:border-box, in which case only margins are added to the 100% to change how its total width is calculated). This may be what you want, but most likely it isn’t.Source:http://www.456bereastreet.com/archive/201112/the_difference_between_widthauto_and_width100/The initial width of a block level element like div or p is auto.Use width:auto to undo explicitly specified widths.if you specify width:100%, the element’s total width will be 100% of its containing block plus any horizontal margin, padding and border.So, next time you find yourself setting the width of a block level element to 100% to make it occupy all available width, consider if what you really want is setting it to auto.Width 100% :

It will make content with 100%. margin, border, padding will be added to this width and element will overflow if any of these added.Width auto : 

It will fit the element in available space including margin, border and padding. space  remaining after adjusting margin + padding + border will be available width/ height.Width 100% + box-sizing: border box :

It will also fits the element in available space including border, padding (margin will make it overflow the container).Using width:auto; + display:inline-block; in css giving awesome effect.When we say width will never exceed the total width of parent element. Maximum width is it's parent width. Even if we add border, padding and margin, content of element itself will become smaller in order to give space for border, padding and margin. In case if space required for border + padding + margin is greater than total width of parent element then width of content will become zero.When we saywidth of content of element will become 100% of parent element and from now if we add border, padding or margin then it will cause child element to exceed parent element's width and it will starts overflowing out of parent element.

I know I've read about this before but can't seem to find any solution to my problem.  Any help or suggestions are much appreciated!In your code, you've got a label on the form itself. You want to put labels on each individual radio group, as shown below.You should keep in mind that two elements should never have the same ID. The name attribute is used so that the radio buttons function as a group and only allow a single selection at a time.There seems to be a little unclickable space between the radio button and the label if done according to Nathan's answer. Here is how to make them join seamlessly (see this article):The label tag should be around each answer, e.g. around Abe, Andrew, etc... and it needs to be unique for each of them.Nesting the input tag within the label tag ensures the label appears right next to the radio button. With the earlier approaches suggested, you can put the label tag anywhere within the html file and it will select the associated radio button when clicked. Check this out:Doing it this way instead eliminates this flaw:You can do it like thisSo if you click on the text or label it selects the radio button.

But if you do this...and you add this to what the code I wrote just before this then if you click on the 2nd label then it will also select the radio.I have been doing this for years, but neither of these work for me, using variables.and here is the source:

Here is my markup:If I apply a 100% width to the .table-responsive class, it makes the table itself a 100% wide but the child elements (TBODY, TR, etc.) are still narrow.The following WON'T WORK. It causes another issue. It will now do the 100% width but it won't be responsive on smaller devices:All these answers introduced another problem by recommending display: table;. The only solution as of right now is to use it as a wrapper:This solution worked for me:just add another class into your table element:

w-100 d-block d-md-tableso it would be :

<table class="table table-responsive w-100 d-block d-md-table">for bootstrap 4 w-100 set the width to 100% d-block (display: block) and d-md-table (display: table on min-width: 576px)Bootstrap 4 display docsIf you're using V4.1, and according to their docs, don't assign .table-responsive directly to the table. The table should be .table and if you want it to be horizontally scrollable (responsive) add it inside a .table-responsive container (a <div>, for instance).doing that, no extra css is needed.In the OP's code, .table-responsive can be used alongside with the .col-md-12 on the outside .For some reason the responsive table in particular doesn't behave as it should. You can patch it by getting rid of display:block;I may file a bug report.Edit:It is an existing bug.None of these answers are working (date today 9th Dec 2018). The correct resolution here is to add .table-responsive-sm to your table:This applies the responsiveness aspect only to the SM view (mobile). So in mobile view you get the scrolling as desired and in larger views the table is not responsive and thus displayed full width, as desired.Docs: https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/content/tables/#breakpoint-specificThe solution compliant with the v4 of the framework is to set the proper breakpoint. Rather than using .table-responsive, you should be able to use .table-responsive-sm (to be just responsive on small devices)You can use any of the available endpoints: table-responsive{-sm|-md|-lg|-xl}That's because the .table-responsive class adds the property display: block to your element which changes it from the previous display: table.Override this property back to display: table in your own stylesheet Note: make sure this style executes after your bootstrap code for it to override.It's caused by the table-responsive class giving the table a property of display:block, which is strange because this overwrites the table classes original display:table and is why the table shrinks when you add table-responsive. Most likely its down to bootstrap 4 still being in dev. You are safe to overwrite this property with your own class that sets display:table and it won't effect the responsiveness of the table.e.g.Taking in consideration the other answers I would do something like this, thanks!just wrap table with .table-responsive{-sm|-md|-lg|-xl}for example bootstrap 4 tablesI found that using the recommended table-responsive class in a wrapper still causes responsive tables to (surprisingly) shrink horizontally:The solution for me was to create the following media breakpoints and classes to prevent it:Then I can add the appropriate class to my table element. For example:Here the wrapper sets the width to 100% for large and greater per Bootstrap. With the table-lg class applied to the table element, the table width is set also set to 100% for large and greater, but set to 992px for medium and smaller. The classes table-xs, table-sm, table-md, and table-xl work the same way.For Bootstrap 4.x use display utilities:w-100 d-print-block d-print-tableUsage:

They also have a margin-right of 30px, but because the 3rd 6th and 9th list item has this margin it makes them jump down a row making the grid display wronglyHow easy is to make the 3rd 6th and 9th not have the margin-right without having to give them a different class, or is that the only way to do it?Yes, you can use what's known as :nth-child selectors.In this case you would use: :nth-child(3n)::nth-child() is compatible in Chrome, Firefox, and IE9+.For a work around to use :nth-child() amongst other pseudo-classes/attribute selectors in IE6 through to IE8, see this link.You can use the :nth-child selector for thatTry thisDEMOnth-child browser support:nth-child is the answer you are looking for.
