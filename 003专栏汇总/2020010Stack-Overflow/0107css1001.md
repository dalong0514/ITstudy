I found this in a jQuery file:What do the curly braces do?In your case it is an object passed to your css function.Here you can use this tooHere is another example of objectA fiddle is here.The curly braces in the code you've shown define an object literalIn javascript curly braces are used for several purposes.I your case these are used to create a key-value pair.In others cases curly braces are used to combine a set of statements in a block.

And sometimes they are used to create objects

like var abc = { "a": 1, "b": 2 };It's an object literal.var x = {'float': 'right'} is the nicer/shorter form of var x = new Object(); x.float = 'right';Creates an object.That is an object literalcurly braces identify an Object like so:in jQuery they are used to provide an Object with options for your method.

You could also write your code like so xxx.css("width","10px").css("font-size","30px"); But passing it an Object makes it faster and more readable Basically the curly braces {} are the another way for creating objects in javascript. This is equivalent to the "new Object()" syntax.Creates Object Literal.Read more if you want here: http://www.dyn-web.com/tutorials/obj_lit.phpThey encapsualte the css attributes in this example.Normally curly brackets represent a function or an encapsulated piece of code that needs to be executed as one. 

Media Query Styles Not Overriding Original Styles

[Media Query Styles Not Overriding Original Styles](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/19038240/media-query-styles-not-overriding-original-styles)

I'm attempting to use some media queries for a website I'm building. The problem I'm having however, is while the media query styles are actually being applied, they're being overridden. I can't for the life of me tell why because I'm using the same exact selectors. Can anyone point out something that I'm not seeing?ORIGINAL CSSMEDIA QUERY CSSThe second media query is working fine, where I set the nav to have a display of none. However, when I try to set the width of #global-wrapper-inner to 100% it doesn't apply. I can see the style being "applied" when I press F12 and select that element. However, the style itself is crossed out and not actually applied and it still has the original width of 85%.

However, the style itself is crossed out and not actually applied and it still has the original width of 85%.The selectors in your original CSS have the same specificity as the selectors within your media queries (the first declarations are also targeting the same property - width) and because the media query rule set is being overridden I'm going to assume that it appears before the original rule set.The second media query selector works because it's targeting a property that wasn't set in your original CSS, so specificity isn't relevant. To have the first media query selector take precedence, prepend an ancestor element to it:You need to link the media query file (queries.css) later than the normal css file (style.css). That way the rules in the queries.css will override those in style.css.I have been at least 2 hours trying to find the override CSS problem till I found that my line comments where wrong... And the second definition of CSS wasn't working:So, don't be so stupid as I !:never use: Double bar as I did:What about using !important? If you range your media query from ( min-width: 176px ) and ( max-width: 736px ) or even up to 980px?

See http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/box.html#collapsing-marginsWhat you experience is margin collapsing. The margin doesn't specify an area around an element, but rather the minimum distance between elements.As the green container doesn't have any border or padding, there is nothing to contain the margin of the orange element. The margin is used between the top element and the orange element just as if the green container would have the margin.Use a padding in the green container instead of a margin on the orange element.Use padding instead of margin:Not sure if this will work in your case, but I just solved this with the following CSS properties#element was being pushed down because it's first child element had a margin-top: 30px. With this CSS, it now works as expected :) Not sure if it'll work for every case, YMMV.You can either add padding-top: 30 on the green box, use relative positioning on the orange box with top: 30px, or float the orange box and use the same margin-top: 30px.You read this document:

Should I inline all CSS files programmatically to optimize page load speed?

[Should I inline all CSS files programmatically to optimize page load speed?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/32814706/should-i-inline-all-css-files-programmatically-to-optimize-page-load-speed)

Google PageSpeed often suggests to optimize CSS delivery. It occurred to me that it would reduce network round trips to inline all the CSS like this: This seems to be a reasonable solution to the problem of slow page loads and has increased my PageSpeed score to 95 from 88.Putting code-style aside for the moment, what technical reasons, if any, exist for NOT in-lining all CSS in this way?

Google PageSpeed often suggests to optimize CSS delivery. It occurred to me that it would reduce network round trips to inline all the CSS like this: This seems to be a reasonable solution to the problem of slow page loads and has increased my PageSpeed score to 95 from 88.Putting code-style aside for the moment, what technical reasons, if any, exist for NOT in-lining all CSS in this way?Inlining all your CSS means it cannot be cached, so every single page load will contain all of the CSS required, and when you are using large libraries that can really be a lot of wasted bandwidth. For example, Bootstrap is around 120k. Note the Google link you shared specifies the following (emphasis mine):So a single page load may be faster but overall it's likely to be slower. Personally I would stay away from doing that. However, one thing you can do is bundle all of your CSS into a single request (you are using MVC so that is relatively simple) so you only have to do a single extra trip to the server for your CSS and all future pages requested by the browser will not need to ask for them again.No one has mentioned the intended use case for this technique, which is definitely not to load 100% of your css.  Rather, this technique is meant to make users think the page has loaded faster.When we discuss making pages load faster, the real goal is generally to make the page load seem faster.  From the perspective of the user experience, this is much more important than actually making the load take less time.  It doesn't matter if the whole page take 500ms to load, because a human can't parse it that quickly anyway.  What matters is how quickly the page appears to have loaded.So the appropriate usage of this technique is to load, immediately, the absolutely essential css to make the page render properly.  That is, there are some css rules that make the images be the right size, that make things float correctly, that avoid that horrible appearance of page content jumping around the page while the facebook SDK finishes its business.  That code needs to be present in the same instant the markup is loaded.  Solution: inline that critical css.But definitely DO NOT inline all of the css.  There can be another 100kb that loads later, if that css only styles content that is loading asynchronously anyway.  But if there is page structure that must be in the correct form after 25ms, that css should be inlined.You misunderstood the PageSpeed suggestion. The recommendation is for small CSS files:In fact, the article later suggests a balanced approach for large CSS files: inline critical CSS and defer-load the remaining CSS file.Now, even if PageSpeed gives you a decent score after inlining large CSS files* it might still be a bad idea:Inline CSS files means you duplicate the <style>...</style> tag across pages. This means you serve redundant data for subsequent or repeat page views. The redundant data costs bandwidth and increases download time.Separate CSS file along with strong caching headers allow you to eliminate redundancy. Caching headers instruct the browsers to cache the CSS file on first page view and reuse on subsequent or repeat page views.Inline CSS files reduce the proportion of "actual" content on the page. Inline CSS files require you to insert the CSS above the content while most of us strive to put the actual content near the top HTML. Inline CSS will also cause the browser to download additional bytes before allowing it to download other resources such as JavaScript and images.If your HTML page is generated dynamically then, most likely, it will be served uncompressed. Some servers (e.g. IIS) and software (e.g. Wordpress) allow compression of dynamic content but requires more CPU + Memory compared to compression of static content (e.g. CSS files). This is yet another reason why you should keep CSS in separate file.For the above reasons I would keep my CSS combined, minified, compressed and cached, in a separate file, even for one page websites.* Not to be confused with inline stylesThis is too long to fit in a comment. There where I work, we use Content Security Policy header directives (specifically style-src) to explicitly prohibit the use of inline CSS. The rationale not to use inline CSS in this case is minimizing the risks of CSS injection for pages created dynamically. OWASP has detailed information about this topic, including exploit samples: https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Testing_for_CSS_Injection_(OTG-CLIENT-005). If only static content is served to the browser, there should be no risk.

However, the content goes behind the menu.  I have set clear: both; and this has not helped.What you need is an extra spacing div (as far as I understood your question).This div will be placed between the menu and content and be the same height as the menu div, paddings included.HTMLCSSSee my example here.This works by offsetting the space that would have been occupied by the nav div, but as it has position: fixed; it has been taken out of the document flow.The preferred method of achieving this effect is by using margin-top: 95px;/*your nav height*/ on your content wrapper.Having just struggled with this and disliking some of the "hackier" solutions, I found this to be useful and clean:If your menu height is variable (for responsiveness or because it's loaded dynamically), you can set the top margin to where the fixed div ends. For example:CSSJavascriptHTMLHere's a fiddle (https://jsfiddle.net/632k9xkv/5/) that goes a little beyond this with both a fixed nav menu and header in an attempt to hopefully make this a useful sample.I just had this problem, and this was my solution:Adjust for the height of your floatingMenu. If you don't know for sure that it's a div following then you can use * rather than div.  This is all valid CSS2.I liked grdevphl's Javascript answer best, but in my own use case, I found that using height() in the calculation still left a little overlap since it didn't take padding into account. If you run into the same issue, try outerHeight() instead to compensate for padding and border.Wrap the menu contents with another div:And the CSS:And about your page below the menu, you can give it a padding-top as well:I just added a padding-top to the div below the nav. Hope it helps. I'm new on this. C:To those suggesting the use of margin-top or padding-top to move the main division below the fixed menu - you don't seem to be testing it completely.If you set a margin or padding, it will scroll with the page and you will lose lines - go try this pageLooks good, does it not? Highlight a word on the bottom visible line and press page-down - the line with the highlighted word, and a few other lines, will be scrolled under the fixed division.Margin-top or padding-top WILL position the main division below the fixed division but it all falls flat on its face when you page-down or click the scroll bar to scroll one viewport height of the page.Same problem if you page-up, lines "fall off" the bottom of the view-port.Does anyone have an actual fix for THIS problem?I know how to position things - that's fairly easy if you know the basics about margins, padding, etc. - but how do you prevent the loss of lines when scrolling?I've looked at a lot of examples of what are claimed to be a properly functioning pages with fixed divisions at the top, but they don't work! They all have problems which scrolling.I have come across some pages appear to work but if the fixed division is made higher, lines will be lost. I believe I know why they appear to work.Think in terms of how text on a totally normal (no fancy formatting) page scrolls. Do you see the bottom line when you scroll up or do you see the next line - the bottom one having scrolled off the top of the viewport?Answer - you see the bottom line scrolled to become the top line.The fixed menu pages that seem to work really don't. Scroll them and the bottom line is scrolled off the viewport but since the next line is visible, it appears that the fixed division works - but we know better, don't we?If the fixed division gets higher than the height of one line of text, they fail and lines are lost.The only pages that I've seen that actually work properly are on sites such as yahoo and I don't have the time, nor inclination, to dig down into what is a lot of CSS, HTML, and JavaScript on the pages to get to the heart of the matter.So - go to that page and see if you can make changes ("inspect" the elements and make changes to the CSS rules) that fix the scrolling problems.If you can, come back and share your discovery with world.My page is a good place to look at what it takes to be able to fix a division at the top, center it (and the main division) and restrict it to a max-width. It may help some of you but I'm sorry I don't have a fix for the scrolling problemPlay with the height of the fix division - make it short enough so that only one line shows and then play with the scrolling. Then make it large enough for two lines and then three and play with the scrolling. You'll see the issues.Here is a page that is supposed to work but it doesn't - read the very last comment - they describe the problem in a different way but it is the same problemI just tested the page again in Chrome and it seems to work fairly satisfactorily. With FF the problem exists. Haven't tried IE again, yet.So - what is different with FF?Here's a page at cNet which works with chrome and ff - so what are they doing?More testing with Chrome shows that it fails to fully display the bottom line when scrolled. Just part of the line that was at the bottom is visiable when your scroll - so, still need a fix.You should try that Pen I hope that will help you and even give more better functionality to use fixed navigation1.clear:both; you dont need to use clearHere's a responsive way of doing it with jQuery.A #spacer div must be placed between the header and main body, like this:The header's position will be fixed, while the spacer will keep its default static position:Finally you need to make sure that both the header and spacer have the same size-related properties, like so:This works for me at least.There is (at least) one wayhack to get truly dynamic height without javascript: insert the menu twice:Depending on the rest of your site, you might have to tweak the z-index styles of the <nav> elements.

Please help me.In your CSS:orIn environments/production.rb:For sass (scss) this code works with the following image pathapp/assets/images/pictureTitle.pngYou might also need to restart your rails server.If you have the image in your public directory like public/bg.jpgIf you have image in app/assets/images/bg.jpgThe problem could be more deeply ingrained than you think. It most likely is not a Rails asset problem as many presume, but 'miscommunication' between your html elements. Here's why:Hope this helps someone.

And along with this I realised that it was not that easy to place the background image to cover the nav as well, esp if using bootstrap; both the nav and your other element need to be children of the same parent element, eg, mine was the header as shown above, and you'll also have to render the nav inside your, say, homepage.html.erb, and every other page, as opposed to just rendering it on the application.html.erbUpdateOkay, this is what I did to show the full background image without inserting texts here and there. In my application.scss, where you have your css, I simply added the height property, like soN.B: Using height: 100% didn't work.If you are using sass (scss), use image-url function:I followed the suggestions above (Thank you!) - just in case it doesn't work for others either - this solution worked for me: so instead of "background-image" I had to use "background" in my scss. Lots of answers for this one, figured I'd throw in my solution, which addresses the original question, since they were originally attempting to use, among other things, an ERB helper:following the link from above from Kangkyu, I learned it's possible to add the .erb file extension onto my .css file. Which is definitely what Kangkyu did. application.css.erbThis gives me access to the helper methods. Instead of fussing with figuring out the correct path to the image, I used:so my CSS property/value pair looks like this:I struggled with this for an entire day. Finally I got it working in both development and production by coding the css in the view that holds the background image:Then on the sheet itself I created a div with id=tile like this:Ruby 2.3.7 Rails 5.2.0Ok, hope this helps someone!! I was in a similar situation recently looking to implement an image for a theme.

This solution worked for me in a home_page_header.html.erb file provided that you have an image called blog_image.jpeg in your app/assets/images folder:[CONTEXT] Ruby 2.6.3 | Rails 6.0.1 | Using webpack to bundle stylesheets.I realized I couldn't deliver images from the asset pipeline in [s]css from webpack files: for instance, Asset Helpers from sass-rails are unavailable.After some struggle, I found the solution on https://stackoverflow.com/a/57175231/8131629Try the code below:if you have your image into app/assets/images and its name is 'zi-fullscreen-bg.png', for example

When I examine the element in Chrome I see and look at the computed property I see:Under computed styles in Firefox I get:The last three lines are struck out.  Why is my css rule being overridden?  Are there steps I can take to find out?This is an outside shot without your code, but the solution when I had the exact same problem.  My DOCTYPE statement had gotten fouled up by an errant keystroke, as described in this question.  You might want to inspect it visually and/or validate.This might sound odd, but it helps to check (especially if you aren't using an IDE or one that doesn't do validation on your CSS). You might want to make sure that you have a ; and not a : at the end of your:style; line. Because at a glance, in the inspector the syntax appears to be correct but isn't. So your user agent stylesheet overwrites it. It's one of those "make sure your printer is plugged in" checks. It happens to all of us every once in a while.

What happens if you place a fixed-position element inside another?

What happens if you place a fixed-position element inside another? Example CSS along the lines of:And HTML: As far as I can tell, the element is fixed-positioned with respect to its nearest parent that's also fixed-positioned. Is this osbervable in all browsers; also, is it a bug, or intentional behaviour?So far I've not found anything on this topic on the internet, just 'fixed position makes it stick to the page'.The fixing and the positioning are two separate things. They're positioned the same as absolutely positioned elements: relative to their containing block. But in contrast with absolutely positioned elements, they remain fixed to that position with respect to the viewport (i.e. they don't move when scrolling):http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/visuren.html#propdef-positionThe definition of containing block says:andwhich suggests that while their positioning algorithm is the same (they're both positioned relative to their containing block), the containing block for fixed elements is always the viewport, in contrast with absolutely positioned elements, so they should be positioned relative to that and not to any absolutely or fixed-positioned elements.And as a matter of fact, that is indeed the case. For example, if you add top: 20px to .fixed, both divs will be positioned 20 pixels from the top of the viewport. The nested fixed div does not get positioned 20 pixels down from the top of its parent.The reason you're not seeing that in this case is because you're not actually setting any of the left/top/right/bottom properties, so their positions are determined by the position they would have in the flow (their "static position"), which as my first quote said, is done according to the absolute model.I don't think this is really the intent. Things with fixed positioning are all positioned in relation to the window, if you have a fixed a child of another fixed, what do you want to happen? You can easily duplicate the behavior by not just position both of the fixed elements separately, or using other position to alter the child's position within the fixed element. :DI dont think there is anything more to this then what w3c say there is:So if you get rid of that "padding: 40px;" you will get 2 elements - 1 over another.Same effect like if you positioned both elements absolutely to top:0 left:0 with same parent(body).Short Answer:if you have a scrollable element with fixed position (a modal for example), and you want to make one of the childs fixed also(modal close button for example), here is the solution: you can make your element non-scrollable, and instead create a child inside of it and make it scrollable(modal content for example). this way , you can apply position: absolute to the child you want it to be fixed (modal close button for example), instead of position: fixed.Long Answer:In my case, i had a display: fixed Modal and applied the overflow: auto to it to make it scrollable. then i wanted to make the close button display: fixed.Nesting display: fixed worked on chrome, but not in Firefox. so i changed my structure, i removed the overflow: auto from Modal to make it non-scrollable, and instead made the modal content scrollable. and also added position: absolute to close button.

I don't want 50% whitespace around the element after I move it. I've tried re-setting the height/width, but that causes the element iself to undergo a new layout and then the scale is applied to the new layout and this still leaves me with 50% white space after all is finished.

This sort of feels wrong because I am drifting in the direction of writing my own layout manager in javascript just to get this effect.The problem I noticed is that when element scales, browser change its pixels ratio, not pixels amount. Element is smaller but it doesn't change its actual pixel size in DOM. Because of that I don't think that CSS-only solution exist.I put scalable element into container which keeps the same pixel ratio as rest of elements. Using Java Script I simply change container's size. Everything is still based on CSS3 transform: scale. Maybe JS code could be simplier, but now it's all about the idea (just a proof of concept);) Fiddle with two examples: http://jsfiddle.net/qA5Tb/9/HTML:CSS:JS:I finally figured out a simple solution and it is much similar than where I started from. I will admit, it took many attempts to figure this out (over the last year or so) to finally figure it out. I was actually looking for an answer to this question. I have had problems with this before. Anyways, I started working this out again and I did find a simple solution. Anyways, the trick was to use the margin bottom together with the CSS calc script. Also, you must have to have absolute height declared for the the object (div). I dont think this will work with if the div can expand, otherwise, after many attempts and hours on this I finally have a very simple, clean, working solution. So, for example, height = 300px (not 30%, or no height). I would even set overflow-y = hidden if you can. If you want the div to grow (not have an absolute height), I believe you will need JavaScript. I did not try it. Otherwise this is working correctly in all tests. I am sure this will work nice with SASS or LESS since you could declare some of the repeated things using variables in the CSS. I have not tried that yet.Some important comments on my solution:I have also have set up a Codepen to test this with and for sharing.https://codepen.io/cyansmiles/details/yvGaVPI had to tweak my code a little from above.It now works on all sides (not just up and down). I see a little edit, I think that is CSS issue (you could add another pixel to code to resolve this).Here is the working Codepen link. Feel free to let me know if you use it. It felt good to finally figure this out.https://codepen.io/cyansmiles/pen/bLOqZops. I am forking my codepen to add a moveable CSS.

I would like to know why it is not working. I am really new at html and css and this question may be dumb but plz help me. Thanks in advance.Short answer is that you need to change the z-index so that #firstdiv is considered on top of the other divs.I messed with my css for hours, changing the positioning and z-index of just about every element on the page.  I deleted every other element from the DOM except for the one with the cursor: pointer on hover, and it STILL didn't work.For me, on Mac OSX El Captain V 10.11, the issue had to do with some sort of interference with Photoshop CC.  Once I closed photoshop, the cursor started working again.Solution for me: Close and reopen photoshopcursor:pointer doesn't work when you're using Chrome's mobile emulator.Just happened to me, and in my case it was due to a CSS rule pointer-events: none; which was set on a parent element and I forgot about it.This caused any pointer events to be just ignored, which includes the cursor.To fix this, you can just set the style to allow pointer events:Or directly in the element:Also add cursor:hand. Some browsers need that instead.It works if you remove position:fixed from #firstdiv - but @Sj is probably right as well - most likely a z-index layering issue.I had this issue using Angular and SCSS. I had all my CSS nested so I decided to remove cursor: pointer; out of it. And it worked.Example:I have the same issue, when I close the chrome window popup browser inspector its working fine for me.The problem in my case was that the :after blocked mouse events, so I had to add pointer-events: none; to my :after block.worked for me.Position the element as relative and then use z-index, it worked for me :)

I have a hex value of some color, for example #202010. How to generate a new color which is either lighter or darker given in percent  (ie. 20% darker) in PHP?

2010-08-18 12:59:17Z

I have a hex value of some color, for example #202010. How to generate a new color which is either lighter or darker given in percent  (ie. 20% darker) in PHP?Adjusting colour by percent, as in the example given by Frxstrem, is not ideal.If your colour is black (0,0,0 in RGB), you will be multiplying by zero, which will not yield any change at all. If your colour is dark gray (for instance 2,2,2 in RGB), you will have to lighten by 50% to just move up to (3,3,3). On the other hand, if you have an RGB colour of (100,100,100), the adjustment of 50% will move you up to (150,150,150), which is a much bigger change in comparison.A much better solution would be to adjust by step/number (0-255) instead of by percent, for instance like this (PHP code):Edit 2014-01-06: Cleaned up the code a bit.The answers are wrong.Using RGB model is a conceptual error.You need to transform the color from RGB (or Hex form) into HSL.That is Hue, Saturation, Lightness.Once you convert it from RGB into HSL, to lighten up the color you simply adjust the L value (lightness) by 10%. Then once you are done you convert back from HSL to RGB and you are done.Voila!RGB to HSV in PHPHere's an example:Extract the colors. I'd prefer to use regular expressions, though there are probably other more efficient ways too.Now we have red in $parts[1], green in $parts[2] and blue in $parts[3]. Now, let's convert them from hexadecimal to integers:Then we'll decrease them by 20 %:Now, we'll turn them back into hexadecimal and add them to our output stringThen just add a "#" to the beginning of the string, and that's it!Torkil Johnsen's answer is based on fixed step which doesn't manipulate only brightness but also slightly changes the hue. Frxstrem's method has flaws too as Torkil Johnsen noted.I've taken this approach from a Github comment and improved the code. It works perfectly for any case.Here is an example result:I was interested in this, but my question was how do I add a opacity to a colour?I wanted a colour to fade, not made lighter.  i found this: 

http://www.gidnetwork.com/b-135.html

and it worked great- code posted from original site for SO readers.https://github.com/mikeemoo/ColorJizz-PHP allows to convert to HSL, change lightness component and convert back to RGB.If you want a simple implementation and you don't care that much about the values being specifically above 50% lightness (or whatever your threshold), you can use my solution for lighter colors:The idea is to generate a random color in the higher part of the palette. You can adjust the results to be more or less dark by changing the "1.5" value:You can do the same for darker colors by setting the starting point of the random function to "0x000000" and dividing the end limit:I know this is not a precise but it works for me.

I was peeking at one of the Bootstrap examples that use the card-deck and card classes (Pricing example). I wondered how one can fix the button alignment if one of the lists has fewer items than the others.I would like all buttons to be vertically aligned (at the bottom of each card) but I couldn't figure out a way of doing this. I tried setting the .align-bottom class as well as wrapping the button in <div class="align-text-bottom">. I also tried several suggestions from this question about adding space however still no success (also the spacing should be variable such that it fills up the remaining space from the list).Wrapping in <div class="card-footer bg-white"> didn't yield the desired result either as it doesn't align the button at the bottom of the card and it creates some kind of border around it.Does anyone have an idea?Edit: Here is a jsfiddle that resembles the problem.

Because of this you need to add d-flex flex-column to the card-body. This will make the flexbox alignment classes work.Another option is to use mt-auto (auto top margin) on the button which will push it to the bottom of the Card.Set the .card-body div to display:flex and flex-direction:column.Then give the button margin-top:auto.I imagine there are Bootstrap help classes for this.You have to add:Something like this will work the magic:Use the footer, it already has everything setup for you.Then you can optionally style the card-footer element.demo: https://jsfiddle.net/rustynox/203zwyq6/

Here is the CSS of the outer container div:You may get more luck with setting widths for your table cells if you apply the rule table-layout: fixed to the table - this has helped me with a lot of cell-sizing issues when using tables. I would not recommend switching to using just DIVs to arrange your content if it fits the purpose of tables - to display multidimensional data.I agree with Hristo but there are some cases where table need to be used and solution to your table problem is adding below class to the table and then changing any td width as per your need.I hope this helps for someone who is looking for table solution!Giving it both max-width and min-width attributes should work.I had the same problem with a bunch of columns where I wanted spacers columns.

I used to do:But when the table was wider than window, the spacers were not really 10px, but maybe 5px.

And using only DIVs without a TABLE was not an option in my case.

So I tried:And it worked very well ! :)The best way to set your column widths (td's) is to use a table header (th's). Table headers will set the width on your td's automatically. You just have to make sure that your columns inside your thead are the same number of columns in your tbody.Check it out here:

http://jsfiddle.net/tKAj8/HTMLCSSUse table-layout property and the "fixed" value on your table.After setting up the entire width of the table,

you can now setup the width in % of the td's.You can learn more about in on this link: http://www.w3schools.com/cssref/pr_tab_table-layout.aspI had issues with not being able to size columns in a table-layout: fixed table that was using a colspan. For the benefit of anyone experiencing a variant of that issue where the suggestion above doesn't work, colgroup worked for me (variation on OP's code):For those that are having Table Cell/Column width problems and table-layout: fixed did not help.When applying fixed widths to table cells (<td> or <th>), do not assign a width to all of the cells. There should be at least one cell with an (auto) width. This cell will act as a filler for the remaining space of the table.e.g.P.S. you can use style classes here, you don't need to use an in-line style.Can't modify <td> width; that is, column width isn't settable. You can add the styling white-space:nowrap; which might help. Or you can add &nbsp;s to add space to columns.Maybe you could set col width the HTML way: <td width="70%">January>/td>Unfortunately, in HTML 4.01 and later, that way isn't valid.How about something like this...http://jsfiddle.net/qabwb/1/HTMLCSS

Alternatively, you could apply to "visibility:hidden" to each individual element once their respective animation is complete. This may be slightly quicker for selecting larger groups of elements, since you're only querying the DOM for the group of elements once.I had a similar problem and I solved it this way:To fade in : To fade out:As you can see, I hide the div "#id" once the animation has ended.

See the simple form below. It's just a text box on top of a password box. If you look at it in Internet Explorer 7 (and 8, and probably others) the text box is 10 pixels wider than the password box. Is there a way to "fix" that globally, either through CSS or by adding something to the HTML?

See the simple form below. It's just a text box on top of a password box. If you look at it in Internet Explorer 7 (and 8, and probably others) the text box is 10 pixels wider than the password box. Is there a way to "fix" that globally, either through CSS or by adding something to the HTML? Because different font is used in those types of fields.The fix is simply to specify that all inputs use the same font.You could append a fixed width for all inputs on the current page:The problem is Internet Explorer's default encoding. Internet Explorer has an issue displaying the field lengths the same when using UTF-8 encoding. In IE, try changing the encoding to "Windows" (Page->Encoding in IE 8) while viewing a problem page and you'll see exactly what I mean.If you include the jQuery library in your page(s), you can use the following code to:"When the document is fully loaded, take the first input element with type='text', and apply it's height and width to all input elements with type='password'".I tested this on IE7 only, and it worked like a charm.This is a generalized answer (taking the first element that matches input[type='text']).  You can get a reference to a particular element that you want to match, and then get a reference to one or more password boxes with some other jQuery selector.  Have a look at the documentation for getting elements by id or a group of elements by a common css class or xpath-type expression:http://docs.jquery.com/SelectorsSetting the width on textboxes will solve but I assume that's not what you want.Try setting the min-width on input[type=text], input[type=password] to something greater than the default for textboxes. You'll probably need http://deanedwards.me.uk 's IE8 script to make those selectors work.The font size is irrelevant.  as seen in this test here:

http://build.jhousemedia.com/ie_test.phpI wish I could give you a solid answer as to why but the work around is to apply a fixed width to it.

Is there an easy way to have css3 text-shadow's working in IE9?  At least a single text shadow would be great.  I guess ideally IE8 is supported as well.  I'm hoping there's a simple jquery plugin or .htc file which just looks at text-shadow css property of an element and implements it for IE9.

Is there an easy way to have css3 text-shadow's working in IE9?  At least a single text shadow would be great.  I guess ideally IE8 is supported as well.  I'm hoping there's a simple jquery plugin or .htc file which just looks at text-shadow css property of an element and implements it for IE9.Yes, but not how you would imagine. According to caniuse (a very good resource) there is no support and no polyfill available for adding text-shadow support to IE9. However, IE has their own proprietary text shadow (detailed here).Example implementation, taken from their website (works in IE5.5 through IE9):For cross-browser compatibility and future-proofing of code, remember to also use the CSS3 standard text-shadow property (detailed here). This is especially important considering that IE10 has officially announced their intent to drop support for legacy dx filters. Going forward, IE10+ will only support the CSS3 standard text-shadow.As IE9 does not support CSS3 text-shadow, I would just use the filter property for IE instead. Live example: http://jsfiddle.net/dmM2S/can be replaced withYou can get the results to be very similar.Try CSS Generator.You can choose values and see the results online. Then you get the code in the clipboard.

This is one example of generated code:I was looking for a cross-browser text-stroke solution that works when overlaid on background images. think I have a solution for this that doesn't involve extra mark-up, js and works in IE7-9 (I haven't tested 6), and doesn't cause aliasing problems.This is a combination of using CSS3 text-shadow, which has good support except IE (http://caniuse.com/#search=text-shadow), then using a combination of filters for IE.  CSS3 text-stroke support is poor at the moment.IE FiltersThe glow filter (http://www.impressivewebs.com/css3-text-shadow-ie/) looks terrible, so I didn't use that.David Hewitt's answer involved adding dropshadow filters in a combination of directions. ClearType is then removed unfortunately so we end up with badly aliased text.I then combined some of the elements suggested on useragentman with the dropshadow filters.Putting it togetherThis example would be black text with a white stroke. I'm using conditional html classes by the way to target IE (http://paulirish.com/2008/conditional-stylesheets-vs-css-hacks-answer-neither/).I tried out the filters referenced above and strongly disliked the effect it created. I also didn't want to use any plugins since they'd slow down loading time for what seems like such a basic effect.In my case I was looking for a text shadow with a 0px blur, which means the shadow is an exact replica of the text but just offset and behind. This effect can be easily recreated with jquery.This will create an identical effect to the css3 text-shadow below.here's a working example (see the large white text over the main banner image) http://www.cb.restaurantconnectinc.com/The answer of crdunst is pretty neat and the best looking answer I've found but there's no explanation on how to use and the code is bigger than needed.The only code you need:First you MUST specify a background-color - if your element should be transparent just copy the background-color of the parent or let it inherit. The color at the chroma-filter must match the background-color to fix those artifacts around the text (but here you must copy the color, you can't write inherit). Note that I haven't shortened the dropshadow-filter - it works but the shadows are then cut to the element dimensions (noticeable with big shadows; try to set the offsets to atleast 4).TIP: If you want to use colors with transparency (alpha-channel) write in a #AARRGGBB notation, where AA stands for a hexadezimal value of the opacity - from 01 to FE, because FF and ironically also 00 means no transparency and is therefore useless.. ^^ Just go a little lower than in the rgba notation because the shadows aren't soft and the same alpha value would appear darker then. ;)A nice snippet to convert the alpha value for IE (JavaScript, just paste into the console):ISSUES: The text/font behaves like an image after the shadow is applied; it gets pixelated and blurry after you zoom in... But that's IE's issue, not mine.

Check this out: http://lea.verou.me/css3patterns/#but it still limited on so many aspect. And browser support is also not so ready.your best bet is using small texture image and make repeat to that background. you could get some nice ready to use texture image here:http://subtlepatterns.comYou should try slicing the image if possible into a smaller piece which could be repeated. I have sliced that image to a 101x101px image.CSS:But in some cases, we wouldn't be able to slice the image to a smaller one. In that case, I would use the whole image. But you could also use the CSS3 methods like what Mustafa Kamal had mentioned.Wish you good luck.If you search for an image base-64 converter, you can embed some small image texture files as code into your @import url('') section of code.  It will look like a lot of code; but at least all your data is now stored locally - rather than having to call a separate resource to load the image.Example link: http://www.base64-image.de/When I take a file from my own inventory of a simple icon in PNG format, and convert it to base-64, it looks like this in my CSS: With your texture images, you'll want to employ a similar process.Use an image editor to cut out a portion of the background, then apply CSS's background-repeat property to make the small image fill the area where it is used.In some cases, background-repeat creates seams where the image repeats.  A solution is to use an image editor as follows: starting with the background image, copy the image, flip (mirror, not rotate) the copy left-to-right, and paste it to the right edge of the original, overlapping 1 pixel.  Crop to remove 1 pixel from the right edge of the combined image.  Now repeat for the vertical: copy the combined image, flip the copy top-to-bottom, paste it to the bottom of the combined, overlapping one pixel.  Crop to remove 1 pixel from the bottom.  The resulting image should be seam-free.

CSS3 is ok or even better if it makes things simpler.My main problem is that I managed to align one div containing the text with the button, but the text itself is aligned with the top of the div and not the bottom.I think what you're after is vertical-align: text-bottom;http://jsfiddle.net/EQgFF/3/You can use: line-height!set for the button parent,

where, as you can see, line-height matches the element height

and will align both texts at the element's (p) center.

Otherwise, the button, being an inline element by default, it's subject to manipulations using the CSS property vertical-align: which basically aligns all *inline** elements vertically inside a block level element using this typography terms:*https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/vertical-alignexactly, you can even manually adjust the alignment using PX / -PX and % I've encountered some issues using line-height on Android browsers (), so sometimes the right solution was to play with the parent padding * and vertical-align rather than the inner children's alignments (with line-height).*(note: padding for block elements is more consistent than (top, bottom) used on inner inline elements.)

(If there are 1000 rows, I have to put align='right' or class='right-align-class' 1000 times.)Is there any efficient way to do this ? Is there any direct way to say, align the third column in all rows to right ?To answer your question directly: no.  There is no more simple way to get a consistent look and feel across all modern browsers, without repeating the class on the column.  (Although, see below re: nth-child.)The following is the most efficient way to do this.HTML:CSS:Why you shouldn't use nth-child: The CSS3 pseudo-selector, nth-child, would be perfect for this -- and much more efficient -- but it is impractical for use on the actual web as it exists today.  It is not supported by several major modern browsers, including all IE's from 6-8.  Unfortunately, this means that nth-child is unsupported in a significant share (at least 40%) of browsers today.So, nth-child is awesome, but if you want a consistent look and feel, it's just not feasible to use.You could use the nth-child pseudo-selector.  For example:Then in your table do:Edit:Unfortunately, this only works in Firefox 3.5.  However, if your table only has 3 columns, you could use the sibling selector, which has much better browser support.  Here's what the style sheet would look like:This will match any column preceded by two other columns.If it's always the third column, you can use this (assuming table class of "products"). It's kinda hacky though, and not robust if you add a new column.But honestly, the best idea is to use a class on each cell. You can use the col element to set the width, border, background or visibility of a column, but not any other properties. Reasons discussed here.Looking through your exact question to your implied problem:Step 1:  Use the class as you described (or, if you must, use inline styles).Step 2:  Turn on GZIP compression.Works wonders ;)This way GZIP removes the redundancy for you (over the wire, anyways) and your source remains standards compliant.A number of years ago (in the IE only days) I was using the <col align="right"> tag, but I just tested it and and it seems to be an IE only feature:The snippet is taken from www.w3schools.com. Of course, it should not be used (unless for some reason you really target the IE rendering engine only), but I thought it would be interesting to mention it.Edit:Overall, I don't understand the reasoning behing abandoning this tag. It would appear to be very useful (at least for manual HTML publishing).This doesn't work in IE6, which may be an issue, but it'll work in IE7+ and Firefox, Safari etc. It'll align the 3rd column right and all of the subsequent columns left.if you have only two "kinds" of column styles - use one as TD and one as TH. Then, declare a class for the table and a sub-class for that table's THs and TDs. Then your HTML can be super efficient.The current draft of CSS Selectors Level 4 specifies structural selectors for grids. If implemented, we will be able to do things like:Of course, that doesn't help us today -- the other answers here offer enough practical advice for that.What you really want here is:but it looks like Gecko doesn't support this yet: it's been an open bug for over a decade.(Geez, why can't Firefox have decent standards support like IE6?)Use jquery to apply class to all tr unobtrusively.$(」table td」).addClass(」right-align-class″);Use enhanced filters on td in case you want to select a particular td.See jqueryThe <colgroup> and <col> tags that lives inside tables are designed for this purpose. If you have three columns in your table and want to align the third, add this after your opening <table> tag:along with the requisite CSS:From the W3:

After applying a CSS reset, I want to get back to 'normal' behavior for html elements like: p, h1..h6, strong, ul and li.Now when I say normal I mean e.g. the p element adds spacing or a carriage return like result when used, or the size of the font and boldness for a h1 tag, along with the spacing.I realize it is totally up to me how I want to set the style, but I want to get back to normal behavior for some of the more common elements (at least as a starting point that I can tweak later on).YUI provides a base CSS file that will give consistent styles across all 'A-grade' browsers. They also provide a CSS reset file, so you could use that as well, but you say you've already reset the CSS. For further details go to the YUI website. This is what I've been using and it works really well.One of the rules in applying CSS styles is "last in wins."  This means if your CSS reset styles set elements to margin:0; padding:0 you can then override these rules by declaring your desired values for the same elements afterwards.You can do this in the same file (YUI offers a one-liner reset I think so I sometimes include it as the first line in my CSS file) or in a separate file that appears after the reset CSS <link/> tag.I think by normal behavior you mean "the defaults for my favorite browser."  Your building up CSS rules for these elements is a part of the reset exercise.Now you might want to look into Blueprint CSS or other grid frameworks.  These grid frameworks almost always first reset styles to nothing, then build up the typography for common elements, etc.  This could save you some time and effort.You mean like:?Actually, sorry I mis-read your question, you're after something more like Eric Meyer's total reset @ http://meyerweb.com/eric/tools/css/reset/Rather than using a total CSS reset, think about using something like Normalize, which "preserves useful defaults".To find out what your browser thinks of as default, open a plain HTML file with lists and view the lists with a CSS debugger like Firebug, and look under the Computed tab.Check out YUI (Yahoo's open source user interface conventions).They have a base stylesheet that undoes their own reset css.

They dont actaully recommend you use it in production - since its counter productive but definitely might be worth checking out the file to get relevant snippets for what you want to 'undo'.I recommend you watch the 40 minute talk to get up to speed.Heres a short snippet of their base.css file :Download the full stylesheets below or read full documentation.Yahoo reset css | Yahoo base (undo) reset cssI'm personally a big fan of BlueprintCSS. It resets styles across browsers and provides some really convenient defaults (that are what you want 90% of the time). It also provides a layout grid, but you don't have to use that if you don't need it.If you want to see the css defaults for firefox, look for a file called 'html.css' in the distribution (there should be some other useful css files in the same directory). You could pick out the rules that you want, and apply them after a reset.Also, the CSS2 standard has a sample stylesheet for html 4.Normal behaviour for WebKit h1:Normal behaviour for Gecko h1:The rest of the elements should be there if you search the files."After applying a CSS reset, I want to get back to 'normal' behavior for html elements..."If you've applied a reset, you would then have to add the rules for what you believe to be normal behavior. Since normal behavior varies from browser to browser this question is something of a non sequitur. I like @da5id's answer - use one of the many available resets and tweak it to suit your needs.Once you have assigned a value to a CSS property of an element, there is no way getting back the「normal」value for it, assuming「normal」means「browser default」, as it seems to mean here. So the only way to have, say, an h1 element have the browser default font-size is to not set the property at all for it in your CSS code.Thus, to exempt some properties and elements from CSS reset, you need to use a more limited CSS reset. For example, you must not use * { font-size: 100% } but replace * by a list of selectors, like input, textarea { font-size: 100% } (the list could be rather long, but e.g. browser defaults for font-size differ from 100% for a few elements only).It is of course possible to set properties to values that you expect to be browser defaults. There is no guarantee that this will have the desired effect on all browsers, current and future. But for some properties and elements, this can be relatively safe, because the defaults tend to be similar.In particular, you might use section Rendering in HTML5 CR. It describes「expected rendering」– not a requirement, though browser vendors may decide to claim conformance to them if they so wish, and generally this will probably keep implementations rather similar in this respect. For example, for h1 the expected settings are (collected here into one rule – in HTML5 CR they are scattered around):(There are additional contextual rules. E.g., nesting h1 inside section is expected to affect the settings.)I'm not resetting all the elements by default because the default styles are somehow browser depended, so they varies from browser to browser. Instead of using something like ul, ol { list-style: none; }, I'm adding a CSS class like r or reset and then I specify that if that is a ul which has a r class, reset it or otherwise please leave it to be untouched.By the way you need to add class="reset" (for example) to all of those elements, which is extra work and code, however you'd have all of your default styles untouched at the end in return!

Have small clarifications,As of my knowledge these are the relative and absolute paths,What is the difference between Relative path and absolute path?Is there any performance issues occur for using these paths?Will we get any secure for the sites ?Is there any way of converting absolute path to relativeOne has to be calculated with respect to another URI. The other does not.Nothing significant.NoIn really simplified terms: Working from left to right, try to match the scheme, hostname, then path segments with the URI you are trying to be relative to. Stop when you have a match.The path with reference to root directory is called absolute. 

The path with reference to current directory is called relative.Completely relative:this is a relative path indeed.Absolute in all respects:this is a URL, and it can be seen in some way as an absolute path,

but it's not representative for this matter.The difference between relative and absolute paths is that when using relative paths you take as reference the current working directory while with absolute paths you refer to a certain, well known directory. Relative paths are useful when you make some program that has to use resources from certain folders that can be opened using the working directory as a starting point.Example of relative paths:Example of absolute paths:and so on. Imagine you have a window open on http://www.foo.com/bar/page.html

In all of them (HTML, Javascript and CSS):In HTML and Javascript, the base_path is based on the opened window. In big javascript projects you need a BASEPATH or root variable to store the base_path occasionally. (like this)In CSS the opened url is the address of which your .css is stored or loaded, its not the same like javascript with current opened window in this case.And for being more secure in absolute paths it is recommended to use // instead of http:// for possible future migrations to https://. In your own example, use it this way:Relative PathsA relative path assumes that the file is on the current server.  Using relative paths allows you to construct your site offline and fully test it before uploading it.For example:php/webct/itr/index.php.Absolute PathsAn absolute path refers to a file on the Internet using its full URL. Absolute paths tell the browser precisely where to go. For example:http://www.uvsc.edu/disted/php/webct/itr/index.phpAbsolute paths are easier to use and understand.  However, it is not good practice on your own website.  For one thing, using relative paths allows you to construct your site offline and fully test it before uploading it.  If you were to use absolute paths you would have to change your code before uploading it in order to get it to work. This would also be the case if you ever had to move your site or if you changed domain names.

Should css class names like 'floatleft' that directly describe the attached style be avoided?

[Should css class names like 'floatleft' that directly describe the attached style be avoided?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6222731/should-css-class-names-like-floatleft-that-directly-describe-the-attached-styl)

Lots of websites use class names like floatleft, clearfloat, alignright, small, center etc that describe the style that is attached to the class. This seems to make sense so when writing new content you can easily wrap (for example) <div class="clearfloat">...</div> around your element to make it behave the way you want.My question is, doesn't this style of naming classes go against the idea of separating content from presentation? Putting class="floatleft" on an element is clearly putting presentation information into the HTML document.Should class names like this that directly describe the attached style be avoided, and if so what alternative is there?To clarify, this isn't just a question of what to name classes. For example a semantically accurate document might look something like:Say all these divs need to clear floats, the css would look something like:This starts to get ugly as the number of these clearing elements increases - whereas  a single class="clearfloat" would serve the same purpose. Is it recommended to group elements based on the attached styles to avoid repetition in the CSS, even if this means presentational information creeps into the HTML?Update: Thanks for all the answers. The general consensus seems to be to avoid these class names in favour of semantic names, or at least use them sparingly provided they don't hinder maintenance. I think the important thing is that changes in the layout should not require excessive changes to the markup (although a few people said minor changes are okay if it makes overall maintenance easier). Thanks to those who suggested other methods to keep CSS code smaller as well.

Thanks to those who suggested other methods to keep CSS code smaller as well.It's great until you re-design, and narrow is highlighted yellow, center converts better left-justified, and the image you called floatleft now belongs on the right.I'll admit to the sin of using floatleft and clear as CSS class names, but it is much easier to maintain your CSS if you choose names that relate to the semantic meaning of the content, like feedback and heroimage.Presentational class namesThe HTML spec is clear on this issue: Does clearleft describe the nature of the content? Not really. Eric Meyer made a joke about this a while ago.Try to find a structural relation between the seemingly unrelated elementsLet's say you have paragraphs about ducks, paragraphs about monkeys and paragraphs about frogs. You want them have a blue background. You could add this CSS rule:But aren't they all animals? Just add another animal token:And change the CSS rule to:It is hard and it might not always be possible but the important thing is not to give up quickly.What if you can't?If you have a lot of elements with absolutely no structural relation between them, that indicates a structural problem with your document. Try to decrease these elements. That said, grouping n CSS selectors on one rule is still better than adding n presentational class tokens in your HTML document. Style classes should be semantic. This is a great article on semantic web page design (well, I found it really helpful anyway).EDIT: I just read another article that makes some good points for using things like display: inline-block, display: table etc. instead of floats. That should help avoid those pesky floatleft and clearfix classes. Making them semantic is always up to you though.The main problem with having classes named floatleft, clear or the like is the fact that changes in the design imply changes in the HTML markup. This should not happen, true separation between content and presentation is achieved only when you can re-use the same markup in multiple designs or even media (think sharing the same HTML between desktop and mobile versions of your site and only switching sylesheets).Now, for a practical example :). To add on Fredrik's answer, LESSCSS allow you to hide styles declarations/mixins from developers. This way you can protect reusable components in your stylesheets without the danger of having them pop up in your HTML.Sample markup:Sample less code:Of course, for mobile you might just want to have the company name in bold, without any other styling:I think it depends on how you are using the styles.Content should be named accordingly, as the style may change but the content will likely remain the same.For instance, if you have a div that contains stock info, you should name the div something like div class="stockInfo", so that no matter what the presentation, you can change the styles and the name will not contradict those styles (as opposed to naming the div div class="yellow" and then changing the background-color to red).However you will have "helper styles" and these should be named for what they do.For instance, you will likely want to use a <br /> to clear some floats.  In this case, it is perfectly reasonable to name it <br class="clear" /> and to give it a style of br {clear:both;}.  Again, most Web sites float their images right or left.  To assist with this, you can set <img class="right" src="" /> and <img class="left" src="" /> and then have the styles to match, img.right {float:right;} etc.So it depends on the usage. Class names and ids that describe the function is better than using names that describe the styling of the element.I usually end up not doing it religiously though, because it is in my opinion more convenient to i.e. clear floating elements by using the famous clearfix hack rather than adding clear:both all over the stylesheets.But I think that LESS and SASS creates interesting opportunities to get the best out of both worlds, because you can have mixins and functions that describes some style and still have semantic correct names by just including whatever 'style' you want.Instead of having this HTML and CSSyou could use SASS to create this mixin:and include it into your .navigation class like this:which would reduce your HTML to this:and therefore still get the advantage of having semantic correct names while having a convenient way to share styles between different elements.Andrew; it's good to give sensible name to an class & id which easy to understand for you & your fellow member's which are working on that project. For me classes small , center , floatleft etc define nothing to me because when you give class center that's indicate that the element on the center but there are other properties also in that class like color, background etcFor example in this example class center don't clear to me. but we can use them as a helper class.For example from above example now it clear to me what the role of class center in that panel div  FOR MORE CHECK THESE LINKS :What's the best way to name IDs and classes in CSS and HTML?http://www.ronniesan.com/blog/entry.php?title=organizing-your-dom-elements-with-the-proper-idshttp://cssglobe.com/post/3745/my-top-10-most-used-css-class-namesIf your question is:Then my flat answer would be that in real world, semantic and presentation isn't everything.  So my answer would be: it depends....depends if bandwidth is important to you... On a site with many visitors per hour, then the classnames could even simply be something like "c11" (yes, I've seen it) instead of meaningful, but looong class names....depends also if you perfectly know that when the look and feel will change, then the CODE will change also. (exemple: you redesign a site today in XHTML, but you perfectly know that when you'll re-do the CSS in 2 years, then you'll want the markup to be HTML5, so you will pretty much change the structure anyways...)...depends also if you're already 3 days late on a delivery.  When you're 3 days late, believe me, classnames like "nopadding" starts to appear, as you don't have anymore time to think straight about semantic (neither does your client).Depends on so many things, I'd say...  That's my "real life" point of view of your question.From what I've seen, developers have the tendency to overload their HTML pages with way too many unnecessary classes and extra markup. These classes not only make the page size bigger (and thus the load time longer), they also crowd up the page and make it difficult to manage and modify at a later time. Having things like center and float-left might be helpful when you're dealing with display text that was input by a user (such as a post on a forum), but for general markup purposes you're better off just adding text-align: center and float: left to the appropriate classes. This especially helps if you are trying to change the appearance of your site without changing the HTML much. The less you have hardcoded into your template, the easier it is to only have to change around the CSS when modifying your template. That bit alone is worth it to me.As a general rule of thumb, you really should only give elements classes when it describes what the content is, not where or how it is being displayed. i.e. <span class="movie-information"> instead of <span class="bold">.The only time I feel that it makes sense to give an element a class when it isn't necessary is if you are concerned with Search Engine Optimization. You should definitely read up on Microformats if you are interested in seeing how adding the right classes can actually help search engines. That being said, adding classes that describe how the page is visually displayed does nothing for the search engines.The only time I would ever "group" classes is if they are either displaying the same thing, or if they are siblings. It gets really messy in your CSS when you have elements from all over your page defined together. You're much better off grouping your classes in your stylesheet in ways that you will be able to find them later, rather than saving a few lines by combining them.I think this is where old meets new in web technologies. From times past, it has been difficult to unobtrusively render an outstanding web experience. These class names mostly came in handy when websites were changing webmasters to aid them in understanding the code. It served its cause well but with the new technologies of this day and age, I think this is slowly dying out - infact, it should be dead.The question we should ask is, "Do we need to create a new class for every new innovative design that could pass as a template?". I do not think so. The markup on a site should do what it is meant for - markup. The class names used in the markup should be descriptive of the content and not its looks. The stylesheets - on the other hand - should be able to select elements on a document based on the information in the markup, and style them.I want to relate this to the Rails association naming convention. Consider this...  Obviously, this is not a real model; it is something I am using to drive a point. Consider the case of a deeply nested dependency. These names will grow ridiculous - if they aren't already (i.e. in CSS, <div class='mediumwidth floatright centeredtext graytheme master'></div> or something of the like)Now consider the case where you have different principles. Different developers and designers may - if not 'most definitely will' -  have different reasons for using a specific naming convention. How would this affect refactoring time. I will leave that to your imagination. Also, if your business partner notices a new trend with sites themes that attracts traffic - more technically, assume this business partner has performed some experimental A/B testing and come up with some specs - you don't want to change the contents of the whole stack (ie HTML and CSS and possibly JS pages) to implement this new style.In conclusion, keep styling hints out of your markup. Unobtrusively interact with the document to style and manipulate it. Sass gives you a fine way of styling a site while having your CSS mock your markup. jQuery is another awesome UJS library. HTML5 gives you methods too that make the markup more flexible and yields more information to CSS and JS.I don't think adding a descriptive class name to your document is really a big issue. I find it's easier to work with explicit class names like "floatleft" as opposed to things that are purely semantic or reliant on the cascade. It's usually easier for later developers who don't have the document structure in their heads as well.

You don't want to use them for everything--you wouldn't want to add a class of floatleft to every li in a left-floated menu, but these kind of styles are very good when you need to do a specific thing to one or more elements, and you want to make other developers aware that you did it.

It's like putting in <div class="clear"> or even <div style="clear:both;">: maybe not the prettiest but it sure is obvious what you are doing. 

My rule of thumb is: whatever makes you have to think less, do that.

EDIT: As I said in my comment above, this is most true for classes that refer to clearing and floats, i.e., things that are purely presentational, non-semantic, and yet must be referred to in the HTML. I think in this case it is actually preferable to indicate that you are using a purely presentational class, like floatleft, rather than forcing the float to be attached to some semantic element.I am a developer before a programmer, so for me I use something like a "floatleft" css class as a sort of UtilityMethod.

Meaning, my css class is "floatleft"...and that's all that class does.

so if I say <div class="floatleft"></div> in my mind that is saying "make this div float to the left".

So if that Div also needs a blue background and is my main header it's going to have a different class for that and I end up with <div class="mainheader floatleft"></div>Doing it this way also avoids issues with refactoring.  If I am changing my design later, I will know that "floatleft" ALWAYS floats things left and nothing more.I think, at the end of the day it is about what works for you. If your class name is descriptive of what it does, that does not really go against the rule of separating markup from styles. Another factor to consider is, are you the sole developer, or part of a team. If you are part of a team, or you know your code will be worked on later by other devs, you should establish, and document the naming conventions used.I am currently contracting with Down Jones on some very large projects, and we have a rather lengthy document on naming conventions for our classes, including when to use camel-case, or dashes or underscores, as well as specific prefixes on the class name based on the project we work on. It sounds crazy, but when you have a dozen or so front-end devs working on stuff at the same time, it is a life saver!You are saying something like this:so in order to use this class:ALTERNATIVE SOLUTIONUsage:By this you can actually remove the presentation information from the content. I personally name them things close to what they will be doing. Say I have a class that is on an image gallery and its a primary most used class it will be something like "gallery" or if I'm setting borders around things that are meant to be more decorative I'll name it "decoborder". I try to keep them semi short and somewhat related what task they provide. I don't like to do things like "small, large, H1underlined" or anything that can mimick another tag or function because that can just get confusing. Beyond that I think you should really name it in whatever way makes the most sense to you.If the question is only one of naming, then for one specific class...oror....changes absolutely nothing.  They are only different class names.  The programming functions the same.Either your content & presentation is separated, or it isn't... totally regardless of how you created the names.For what it's worth, if I remember correctly the class keyword in HTML isn't currently used for anything other than CSS stylesheets. Thus, the example that you provided......wouldn't really be a way of identifying data. I would suggest either the name or id attribute if you really want to identify data within your HTML tags. (They both have slightly different uses - name is generally used for server-side queries while id can be styled and is generally more versatile. IDs must be unique, but names don't have to be.) You can check further documentation using the W3C HTML specification.In short - don't worry about tying content to presentation through your tag classes; until they're specifically used for anything else, they will not have any real effect on your raw content. As such, I'd say name your classes whatever you want, as long as it makes sense. Personally, I would err on the side of logical naming versus style-type naming (e.g. class name "editorcomment" instead of class "graybgfloatleft" or something like that), but in the end, your class names aren't going to tie your data to your presentation like an ID or a name would.Good luck.I've done both and I have to say nowdays I lean towards using non presentational classnames. I found this nifty framework called OOCSS https://github.com/stubbornella/oocss/wiki which helped me alot when I was creating a new layout for my web application and suited my requirements so well. It is mostly because the definition of basic classes for spacing, headers and text works so well when you have to deal with alot of content. Because you use the same classes everywhere it helps make the layout better and maintainable.Offcourse this means a element in your html can look like this: <div class="unit size1of3 lastUnit"> But isnt that what HTML is about? Making sure your information is presented properly. I disagree on the whole redesign point, be honest, when you have to redesign your website most CSS goes out the door anyways. And, by dividing the CSS into proper classes for spacing/heading/text it becomes less likely to have conflicting css rules that mess stuff up like ul li div{} Offcourse the classes do not describe the contents, but as CSS does not allow class inheritance and you have to support old technology like IE6...does it really matter? And do classnames like animal and duck really make for better html? Id like to think HTML is for the browser and when the browser renders it, thats for humans.  It depends, sometimes it makes sense just to add a class to let an element float. The problem with the semantic approach is that you will end up ball of mud of css classes. Sure, names like redLink or blackHeader have to be banned but sometimes you will need little helpers like "clear" or "floatLeft". Read this article  of Nicole Sullivan who explain this in deep.There are two things that I feel get entirely left out of these discussions all too often. The first is WHY you would want to be all semantic or all not. The keywords are Branding and Skinning. Presentational class names may be justifiable if you work on some internal, departmental websites where branding and skinning will never in a million years get funding. On the other hand, customer facing sites, such as car manufacturers and department stores live in a world where every single new product that gets launched results in an entirely new skin for the website. New colors, new layout, new background images and all of this lead by designers who should be able to make the change purely in css so there's no chance they can break any working php (or what-have-you). There are also branded sites, where you have multiple skins, potentially running on the same site simultaneously. On sites with that requirement, you can't have visual changes impact html or you end up breaking every other brand just to update one of them. In these situations, semantic class names are a necessity.The second thing that often gets left out is how to combat the problem of repeating groups of properties created by semantic class names, as in:People often point this out as a drawback of semantic names, and I think that that's a valid point. On the other hand I would like to point out that there are tools that can help you keep semantic css DRY, such as LESS and SASS. I did see one other commenter mention this above, but I just thought that this point was worth highlighting.

Is it possible to do a drop shadow on the content of a PNG?Not a square, but an object drop shadow that

acts on the non-transparent content of the PNG.It's definitely possible.Using filters, sample: It's not possible to do that in CSS. However, it's quite possible to do it through a canvas, but it will be somewhat inefficient (as it's processed by the client each time) and will be JavaScript dependent. Doing it in the PNG will be easier and will work on more browsers.If you want more information about it, search the web for things like "html canvas blur" and "html canvas load image". Or better still, use the canvas shadow functionality which can do it all.Here's an example: http://philip.html5.org/demos/canvas/shadows/various.htmlAnd a bonus:How times change. It's now possible in some browsers, as shown in the currently accepted answer.

It's not possible to do this using CSS:That's what I assume you're asking for.

Until it will be available to CSS, you can try my approach.My example uses this picture:because it has a transparent background and it isn't square (for CSS's box-shadow to get into action). It's not very fancy, but serves this small and simple tutorial fine.Next step I took was to create another image, based on the one above, to place it under the original.Step1. Add blur: Step2. Removed light and contrast:So I have the original and the shadow.Next I will display it as if it is a shadow:Style:Do the magic:Add one div and set attribute class="divOriginal common" and another one with class="divShadow common".The result should be:Cheers!AdiI've wrote a jQuery plugin for this, based on Chris Morgan's suggestion about canvas.

I don't get why the following pieces of code produce different results, because css would scale the canvas as it was zoomed in, In contrast with this approach (that works as expected):Think about what happens if you have a JPG that is 32x32 (it has exactly 1024 total pixels) but specify via CSS that it should appear as width:800px; height:16px. The same thing applies to HTML Canvas:If you specify in CSS a different size than the actual dimensions of the canvas it must be stretched and squashed by the browser as necessary for display. You can see an example of this here: http://jsfiddle.net/9bheb/5/The explanation is here: http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/the-canvas-element.html#attr-canvas-width as seen in another post, thanks!The best way to size your canvas is to include in a div and style your div with the size that you want.Here is the CSSHere is the HTML

How do I get an image to stay centered when its fluid width (percentage based) container is too small to show the whole image? How can I center the image inside it's containerThis means it should show the middle of the image instead of the sides when container is too small.You might have a container that holds some content such as two <div>s that are 50% wide each, sitting next to each other. For this example, we can illustrate just one child of the container:

We'll name outer rectangle .container, the inner rectangle .content and the image img. This arrangement is perfectly fine, as long as .content is always wider than img. Since we're dealing with percentages and probably working with a responsive design, this may not always be the case. If .content is ever thinner than img, cropping will occur:If the most interesting part of img is in the center, we need to get the browser to crop both edges evenly - leaving the best part of it visible, no matter what width of .content is.Fortunately, a solution is possible. Even better, no extra markup is required.For new browsers, you can translate itTo support IE8, you can still use the technique presented above by @BryceHanscomb.If you are anticipating that the image to be displayed will be so much longer than the display container, setting left: 100%; and margin-left: -200%; (from Bryce's answer) might not be enough to get the center part of the image. Just put a bigger percentage for both. Make sure that the other is half of the other though.

Here is my JsFiddleWhen I inspect the size of the anchor tags with Chrome developer tools it shows me 144px*18px for the 1st element and 310px*18px for the 2nd element.I want to know why it does not take the height and width of the containing element and how it is being calculated.The CSS 2.1 spec saysThe <a> element defaults to a display value of inline. Its contents participate in the layout so it is a non-replaced element.For height, the spec says:So 18px is arrived at from a single line of text, taken from the font metrics. Neither the larger image content, nor the containing block size plays any part. For width, the spec saysin other words, the width is determined by the <a> element's contents, paddings, borders and margins. For the first <a> element that's 114px (contents - image plus one space) + 20px (left margin) + 2x5px (left and right border) = 144pxFor the second <a> element that's 280px (contents - image) + 20px (left margin) + 2x5px (left and right border) = 310pxJust need to account for the spaces. The elements are being laid out in a line box in a inline context, so the spaces at the start of the first <a> element and at the end of the second <a> element are being dropped. The spaces at the end of the first <a> element and the start of the second <a> element are being collapsed into one space. When spaces are collapsed, it's always the first space which remains, which in this case is the one at the end of first <a> element, so that's why a space participates in the width of the first <a> element but not in the width of the second one.use display:inline-block in anchorhere is updated jsFiddle Filealso remove margin from image and add it to anchoranchor is always display: inline by default. To make anchor took it's child space, you must give him a display:block, or in this case, display:inline-block so that they will be inlineand block.JSFiddleRead this question for more info.The a tag's need to be styled as wellI addedInstead of applying {display: inline-block} on <a>

, try applying {float: left} on the child of <a>. The height of the <a> would now match the height of the child.I had the same issue, for example, I have HTML generated by GitHub flavored markdown, so I can have paragraphs containing anchor with images inside.Actually setting display: inline-block in anchors did not work for me; I did also set display: block in images.

How do I force a css grid container take the full width and height of the device screen for a single page app? Modified example is from Mozilla: Firefox documentationIf you take advantage of width: 100vw; and height: 100vh;, the object with these styles applied will stretch to the full width and height of the device.Also note, there are times padding and margins can get added to your view, by browsers and the like. I added a * global no padding and margins so you can see the difference. Keep this in mind.Two important CSS properties to set for full height pages are these:What you do with your gird is irrelevant as long as you use fractions or percentages you should be safe in all cases.Have a look at this common dashboard layout.You can add position: fixed; with top left right bottom 0 attribute, that solution work on older browsers too.If you want to embed it, add position: absolute; to the wrapper, and position: relative to the div outside of the wrapper.If you want the .wrapper to be fullscreen, just add the following in the wrapper class:

position: absolute;

width: 100%;

height: 100%;You can also add top: 0 and left:0

I am using Bootstrap 'row' class to align divs one on top of another, which works fine but What I noticed is that it specifies margin-left and margin-right attributes to be -13px because of which my contents get shifted towards left. so what I have done is added another class as follows :This solves the purpose, but I would still like to know if there is any specific reason for 'margin-left: -15px;'.

And what is the best approach to solve my problem.The .row is meant to be used inside a container.  Since the container has padding to adjust the negative margin in the .row, grid columns used inside the .row can then adjust to the full width of the container. See the Bootstrap docs: http://getbootstrap.com/css/#gridHere's an example to illustrate: http://bootply.com/131054So, a better solution may for you to place your .row inside a .container or .container-fluidYou can use row-fluid instead of row, then you won't have this problem. (for previous versions of bootstrap)I am not sure of recent versions 3, any way :The issue is that the first column should not have half a gutter on the left, and the last should not have half a gutter on the right. Rather than use some sort of .first or .last class on those columns as some grid systems do, they instead set the .row class to have negative margins that match the padding of the columns. This "pulls" the gutters off of the first and last columns, while at the same time making it wider.For more information on this

Why does the bootstrap .row has a default margin-left of -30px?Are you using Bootstrap 3? My version of the css has -15px, not -13px. In any case, I've simply done what you've down, and overwritten the style.

I believe it's because the .container class has a 15px padding on the left and right, and this negative margin on the rows will pull that content back out to the edge of the container.Old topic, but I was recently affected by this. Using a class "row-fluid" instead of "row" worked fine for me but I'm not sure if it's fully supported going forward. So after reading Why does the bootstrap .row has a default margin-left of -30px I just used the <div> (without any row class) and it behaved exactly like <div class="row-fluid">I was facing this same issue and initially, I removed the row's right and left -ve margin and it removed the horizontal scroll, but it wasn't good. Then after 45 minutes of inspecting and searching, I found out that I was using container-fluid and was removing the padding and its inner row had left and right negative margins. So I gave container-fluid it's padding back and everything went back to normal.If you do need to remove container-fluid padding, don't just remove every row's left and right negative margin in your project instead introduce a class and use that on your desired containerI used 

    div class="form-control"

instead of 

    div class="row"That fixed for me.

The only attribute I figured out to change is the error message by using this example:But, as shown in this example : http://jsfiddle.net/trixta/qTV3g/, you can override the panel style by using jQuery. This is not a plugin, it's a core functionality, uses a DOM lib called Webshims and, of course, some CSS to style the popups.I found that very useful example in this bug post titled Improve form validation error panel UI.I think this is the best solution you can find and only way to override the basic (ugly) error panel.Regards.I'm not sure why, but ::-webkit-validation-bubble-message { display: none; } wouldn't work for me. 

I was able to get the desired result (tested in FF 19, Chrome Version 29.0.1547.76 m) by preventing the default behavior of the invalid event, which does not bubble.Hope that helps others - I looked everywhere for this.For webkit, you can use ::-webkit-validation-bubble-message. For example to hide it:There are also:Update: Chrome does not allow styling form validation bubbles anymore: https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=259050For firefox you can experiment with :-moz-placeholder {}.The current default email validation is currently one of the ugliest things I have ever seen Google design!However it seems to be contained in a standard div so you can make some changes to it, if you remember to then reset these values.I've found you can alter the background, font size and colour, border and shadow, like soIf you then overwrite these for divs inside the html tag, then only the validation is ultimately affected.Unfortunately some of the key attributes that you'd want to change, such as margin and font-weight, cannot be altered.NB. This technique currently only works for Chrome (12), i.e. not work for Firefox 4, Opera 11 or Safari (Win 7).Appended a class to the input type. and displayed message there .Hope that helps after little customization. working codepen:I understand that this is a rather old question but I have found this library that I think this may be beneficial to other that find this.http://afarkas.github.io/webshim/demos/index.html

If you still want to have meaningful warnings, you can do the following workaround.

It will treat errors as warnings, and it will do css validation on css V3.0 level rather than on (old) css V2.1:(Note that the Style Sheet toolbar only allows to enable CSS 3.0 checking for css files, not for HTML. Hence, this fix is needed if you want to keep syntax checking)

Is it possible to achieve this with just one div (no background images/foreground images/layers)?Example on codepen: http://codepen.io/anon/pen/sbHAc/Relevant CSSResulting effectif the browser supports the pointer-events  property  (all major browsers except IE<=10) then  the text under the gradient will be also selectable/clickable.Here is an example for you http://jsfiddle.net/nrgx7/ I (personally) find that using a secondary element as an "overlap" works pretty well. I do this by defining a new tag. This makes it really easy to add the desired fade out effect to any element you want using <fade/> at the end.Giving the fade element an absolute position with a gradient background works just as expected. As long as you remember to set the parent's position to relative.I'll go make a fiddle now, but what I'm thinking is that you can use the :after pseudo-element, positioned on top of the original div, to add a white-to-transparent gradient at the bottom of the original div.

Thanks for the inspiration... It led me to this canvas plugin which does the trickNew and Improved: -webkit- and Firefox Working Example, now re-sizable/fluid.JSCSSHTMLI put it in a click function, because I figured it would be the most likely use case. It will work just as well on document ready.Although the canvas representation wont be pixel perfect, I don't think it will really matter in most cases because its being blurred. Update: As requested this is now re-sizable. I also moved the cover div into the JS and added an svg fall back for Firefox. The resizing requires the canvas to be redrawn on each re-size, so I set it up to hide the canvas, overlay, etc while you're resizing and then replace it when the re-size stops. Basically you could have a overlay placeholder where you duplicate the main content and sync the scrolling of both divs, than apply css blur filter on the overlay only.A simple javascript will do:And for the CSS:I put together a working example for you (webkit only):http://jsfiddle.net/kmxD3/1/Have fun! :)The answer to this is no.The reason is that in order to do what you want you would need direct access to the bitmap used for the browser window to extract or manipulate the pixels in the area you want to blur (I wish, "aero" in a browser could look pretty neat..) or a filter that works on the elements behind the one you apply it to (or can have a limiting region set to it).As there is no native support to do this (besides canvas and extension API, or a library that generate canvas image from the html -> relatively slow) this will need to be done with trickery (images, splitting divs etc.) in either case.If you made everything in your page on a canvas you could do a lot of interesting things, but you would also need to perform layout, update, filtering etc. yourselves and therefor you would be back no non-optimized as Javascript is slower than native (not to mention it would be error prone).Until browsers allow you to grab a section of the window as a canvas (never? as that would require everything on that page to be same-origin or have content with special accept headers set) there is no way around but to do tricks.UpdateAs an demonstration that you can do it by using html2canvas etc, but having to use compromises (-> slow performance) - the demo is rough, experimental and needs tweaks to work well - but for the sake of demo only:

This is currently supported in Safari 9.0, and Chrome behind a flag.Demo:Support right now is only Safari.

backdrop-filter: blur(4px);Unfortunately there is no nice way of doing this, as you figured out you will need a copy of the main div:Overlay will push the wrapper width around while, main-copy will be in the background with blur. Obviously there will be performance issues if the content in main-copy is complex.It has still very limited suport (only Firefox) but one way to get it could be this:The CSS is quite simple:and the key is to use as background for partial overlay the main-view element.This demo uses only opacity because filters are not availables for Firefox.The element property for the background has been approved by w3c, so it could show sometime in the future in webkitIn the demo partial-overlay has been shift to the right to make more clear what is what

I want to know if it's possible to change the text size and color incrementally on the same line, like this:I want to use CSS only if possible. Any other solution, that at least doesn't force me to put each letter in its own span, is welcome, too.What about some transformation and gradient without all these markup:That really depends on your HTML markup. You can't do this with plain text "Lorem ipsum", but you can do it if each letter is wrapped in its own separate element pretty simply:You likely won't be able to do this without modifying your existing markup or introducing some JavaScript to do this for you, however.As for the colour, you can change the opacity of each letter with this approach (as per the above example), but I'm not sure if this is possible as easily without having to apply styling to each letter individually.Using James Donnelly answer with a bit of JS:inspired from @James Donnelly's answer this solution more dynamic , spans will be generated using javascriptcheckout the codeImpossible. Without wrapping the letters inside HTML tags simply You can't change CSS properties of the single letters.

The only thing that I've found is the ::first-letter selector, for the first letter, not the following.CSS font-size Property and CSS color Property are properties that you can define in the context of selectors.So, defining CSS properties without pointing to elements (in this case, HTML  element) seems to be not possible.Using JavaScript is possible to split a string (In this case the innerText of an HTML Element like a paragraph) in letters, wrapping those letters in HTML Elements and then, style those Elements with CSS in several ways. In this case should be better to set CSS programmatically.

To make sure that the #overlay uses the dimensions of whole page, you could use position: relative; on the <body> (but you will need to remove the min-height: 100% and height: 100% on the <body> first because this makes it use the viewport size). The #overlay will then use the <body> dimensions and fill the entire page.

Well, I need to have it disabled or hidden because I was told that I need to match the exact design no matter what.I had to emphasize that by doing this I breach the terms of use of Google service...Well at my work they didn't care about that and they always told me to do it anyway so these is how I'm doing it.In the css I added the following lines of code:Try this for api v3:.gm-style-cc { display:none; }Jan 2018 update. Leaves only clean map:As of Feb 2018 the CSS above makes markers on the map unclickabe. If you don't have any markers you shoudn't have any problems, but if you do just remove the last CSS rule .gmnoprint:not(.gm-bundled-control), the markers will become clickable but there will be some little copyright and terms of use labelsAs you mentioned, removing the Google logo and copyright notices is not compliant with the Google Maps APIs TOS, specifically with paragraph 9.4: "Content provided to you through the Service may contain the Brand Features of Google, its strategic partners, or other third-party rights holders of content that Google indexes. When Google provides those Brand Features or other attribution through the Service, you must display such attribution as provided (or as described in the Maps APIs Documentation) and must not delete or alter the attribution.".

div class vs id

When using divs when is it best to use a class vs id? Is it best to use class, on say font variant or elements within the html? Then use id for the structure/containers? This is something I've always been a little uncertain on, any help would  be great.

2008-09-17 15:20:03Z

When using divs when is it best to use a class vs id? Is it best to use class, on say font variant or elements within the html? Then use id for the structure/containers? This is something I've always been a little uncertain on, any help would  be great.Use id to identify elements that there will only be a single instance of on a page. For instance, if you have a single navigation bar that you are placing in a specific location, use id="navigation".Use class to group elements that all behave a certain way.  For instance, if you want your company name to appear in bold in body text, you might use <span class='company'>.The most important thing to understand is that IDs have to be unique: only one element with a given ID should exist within a page. Thus, if you're wanting to refer to a specific page element, that's often the best thing to use.If you have multiple elements that are in some way similar, you should use the elements class to identify them. One very useful, surprisingly little known fact is that you can actually apply multiple classes to a single element by putting spaces between the class names. Thus, if you posted a question that was written by the currently logged in user, you might identify it with <div class="question currentAuthor">.Student ID cards are distinct. No two students on campus will have the same student ID card. However, many students can and will share at least one Class with each other.It's okay to put multiple students under one Class title, Biology 101. But it's never acceptable to put multiple students under one student ID.When giving Rules over the school intercom system, you can give Rules to a Class:Or you can give rules to a Specific Student, by calling his unique ID:IDs must be unique but in CSS they also take priority when figuring out which of two conflicting instructions to follow.The text would be white.classes are great when you want to apply similar styles to many different divs or elements.  ids are good when you want to address a specific element for formatting or for updating with javascript.An additional benefit to using an ID is the ability to target it in an anchor tag:Will allow you to in some other place link directly to that spot on the page:A common use for this would be to give each headline on a blog a datestamped ID (say id="date20080408") which would allow you to specifically target that section of the blog page.It is also important to remember that there are more restricted naming rules for ids, primarily that they can't start with a number. See similar SO question: What is a valid value for id attributes in htmlThe HTML standard itself answers your question:No two objects may have the same ID, but an arbitrarily amount of objects may have the same class.So if you want to apply certain CSS style attributes to a single DIV only, that would be an ID. If you want certain style attributes to apply to multiple DIVs, that must be a class.Note that you can mix both. You can make two DIVs belong to the same class, but give them different IDs. You can then apply the style common to both to the class, and the things specific to either one to their ID. The browser will first apply the class style and then the ID style, so ID styles can overwrite whatever a class has set before.Some other things to keep in mind:Now you can style the logical division for much of your entire navarea with one class application.IDs should be unique.  CLASSes should be shared.  So, if you have some CSS formatting that will be applied to multiple DIV, use a class.  If just one (as a requirement, not as happenstance), use an ID.I think we all know what class is, but if you think of IDs as identifiers rather than styling tools, you wont go far wrong. You need an identifier when trying to target something and if you have more than one item with the same ID, you can no longer identify it...When it comes to writing your css for IDs and CLASSes, it's beneficial to use minimal css classes as far as possible and try not to get too heavy with the IDs until you HAVE to, otherwise you'll constantly be aiming to write stronger declarations and soon have a css file full of !important.The simple difference between the two is that while a class can be used repeatedly on a page, an ID must only be used once per page. Therefore, it is appropriate to use an ID on the div element that is marking up the main content on the page, as there will only be one main content section. In contrast, you must use a class to set up alternating row colors on a table, as they are by definition going to be used more than once.IDs are an incredibly powerful tool. An element with an ID can be the target of a piece of JavaScript that manipulates the element or its contents in some way. The ID attribute can be used as the target of an internal link, replacing anchor tags with name attributes. Finally, if you make your IDs clear and logical, they can serve as a sort of「self documentation」within the document. For example, you do not necessarily need to add a comment before a block stating that a block of code will contain the main content if the opening tag of the block has an ID of, say, "main", "header", "footer", etc.If it's a style you want to use in multiple places on a page, use a class. If you want a lot of customization for a single object, say a nav bar on the side of the page, then an id is best, because you're not likely to need that combination of styles anywhere else.id is supposed to be the element unique identifier on the page, which helps to manipulate it. Any externally CSS defined style that is supposed to be used in more than one element should go on the class attributeUse an id for a unique element on the page which you want to do something very specific with, and a class for something which you could reuse on other parts of the page.The id attribute is used for elements to uniquely identify them within the document, whereas the class attribute can have the same value shared by many elements in the same document.So, really, if there's only one element per document that's going to use the style (e.g., #title), then go with id. If multiple elements can use the style, go with class.I would say it is best to use a class whenever you think a style element is going to be repeated on a page. Items like HeaderImage, FooterBar and the like go well as an ID since you'll only be using it once and it'll help prevent you from accidentally duplicating it, since some editors will alert you when you have duplicate IDs. I can also see it helpful if you're going to generate the div elements dynamically, and want to target a specific item for formatting; you can just give it the proper ID at generation as opposed to searching for the element and then updating its class.My flavor of choice is to use class identification when css styles are applied to several divs in the same way. If the structure or container is really only applied once, or can inherit its style from the default, I see no reason to use class identification.So it would depend on whether your div is one of several; for instance, a div representing a question to an answer on the stackoverflow website. Here you would want to define the style for the "Answer" class and apply this to each "Answer" div.If you are using .Net web controls then it is sometimes a lot easier just to use classes as .Net alters web contol div id's at run time (where they are using runat="server"). Using classes allows you to easily build up styles with separate classes for fonts, spacing, borders etc. I generally use multiple files to store separate types of formatting information, e.g. basic_styles.css for simple site wide formatting, ie6_styles.css for browser specific styles (in this case IE6) etc and template_1.css for layout information.Which ever way you choose try to be consistent to aid maintenance.  As well, an element you give a specific id to can be manipulated via JavaScript and DOM commands - GetElementById, for example.In general, I find it useful to give all of the main structural divs an id - even if initially, I don't have any specific CSS rules to apply, I have that capability there for the future.  On the other hand, I use classes for those elements that could be used multiple times - for example, a div containing an image and caption - I might have several classes, each with slightly different styling values.Remember though, all things being equal, style rules in an id specification take precedence over those in a class specification.In addition to id's and classes being great for setting style on an individual item verses a similar set of items, there's also another caveat to remember. It also depends on the language to some degree. In ASP.Net, you can throw in Div's and have id's. But, if you use a Panel instead of the Div you will lose the id. Classes are for styles you may use multiple times on a page, IDs are unique identifiers that define special cases for elements. The standards say that IDs should only be used once in a page. So you should use classes for when you want to use a style on more than one element in a page, and an ID when you just want to use it once. Another thing is that for classes you can use multiple values (by putting spaces in between each class, a la "class='blagh blah22 blah') wheras with IDs, you can only use on ID per element. Styles defined for IDs override styles defined for classes, so in , the style settings of #uniquething will override the style of .whatever if the two conflict. So you should probably use IDs for things like, the header, your 'sidebar' or whatever, and so on - things that only appear once per page.For me : If use classes when i will do something in CSS or add name to elements and can use in all elements in a page.So IDs i use for unique elementEx :CSS :

I had to do a combination of the answers listed in this thread:This worked to fix the relative urls, however, I had to delete the font-awesome.min.css file from my bower directory every time I published otherwise the bundler would get confused and not include and minify the font-awesome.css file. So...If I understand correctly, the bundler won't try to minify the .min file again because it's already minified.  The only "drawback" is it does not concatenate the font-awesome.min.css content into the single css file that the bundler creates. It will be included separately.I add another answer to this question has I found the solution by mixing some of them.Last point is the key of all: distributed "min" versions of the js files, does not follow the "CssRewriteUrlTransform" rules.

Either one of these rules will work:Both combinators work identically here; the subtle differences between them only apply when you have other elements in the mix.

You wouldn't think that would work but the same IE's that ignore auto also incorrectly apply the text align center to block level inner elements so things work out.And this doesn't actually do a real float.floating divs to center "works" with the combination of display:inline-block and text-align:center.Try changing width of the outer div by resizing the window of this jsfiddleand the css:Following solution worked for me.One of my websites involves a div whose size is variable and you won't know it ahead of time. it is an outer div with 2 nested divs, the outer div is the same width as the first nested div, which is the content, and the second nested div right below the content is the caption, which must be centered.

Be sure to give the spacers height, or else they will not work.This worked for me..this could help you..:DNo, it isn't.You can either have content bubble up to the right of an element (float: left) or to the left of an element (float: right), there is no provision for having content bubble up on both sides.Float the div in the background to the max width, set a div inside that that's not transparent and center it using margin auto.this works nicelyThis resizes nicely with adaptive layouts also..CSS example would be:This worked for me. I included an unordered list on my page twice. 

One div class="menu" id="vertical" the other to be centered was div class="menu" id="horizontal". Since the list was floated left, I needed an inner div to center it. See below.Try this, it helped me: wrap the div in  tags, the problem is that it will center the content of the div also (if not coded otherwise). Hope that helps :)

I have following html in email template.I am getting different view in MS Outlook and in gmail for the same.How to fix this?

2014-01-31 07:00:35Z

I have following html in email template.I am getting different view in MS Outlook and in gmail for the same.How to fix this?Unfortunately, when it comes to EDMs (Electronic Direct Mail), Outlook is your worst enemy.  Some versions don't respect padding when a cell's content dictates the cell dimensions.The approach that'll give you the most consistent result across mail clients is to use empty table cells as padding (I know, the horror), but remember to fill those tables with a blank image of the desired dimensions because, you guessed it, some versions of Outlook don't respect height/width declarations of empty cells.Aren't EDMs fun?  (No.  They are not.)I changed to following and it worked for meUpdate based on Bsalex request what has actually changed.

I replaced span tagwith table and td tags as following To create HTML in email template that is emailer/newsletter, padding/margin is not supporting on email clients. You can take 1x1 size of blank gif image and use it.Just use

<Table cellpadding="10" ..>

...

</Table>

Don't use px.Works in MS-Outlook. Padding will not work in Outlook.

Instead of adding blank Image, you can simply use multiple spaces(& nbsp;) before elements/texts for padding left

For padding top or bottom, you can add a div containing just spaces(& nbsp;) alone.

This will work!!!I had the same problem and ended up actually using border instead of padding.Avoid paddings and margins in newsletters, some email clients will ignore this properties.You can use empty tr and td as was suggested (but this will result in a lot of html), or you can use borders with the same border color as the background of the email. so, instead of padding-top: 40px you can use border-top: 40px solid #ffffff (assuming that the background color of the email is #ffffff)I've tested this solution in gmail (and gmail for business), yahoo mail, outlook web, outlook desktop, thunderbird, apple mail and more. As far as I can tell, border property is pretty safe to use everywhere.Example:In addition, here is an excelent guide to make responsive newsletters without mediaqueries. The emails really works everywhere:https://webdesign.tutsplus.com/tutorials/creating-a-future-proof-responsive-email-without-media-queries--cms-23919And always remember to make styles inline:https://inliner.cm/To test emails, here is a good resource:https://putsmail.com/Finally, for doubts about css support in email clients you can go here:https://templates.mailchimp.com/resources/email-client-css-support/or here:https://www.campaignmonitor.com/css/Do this instead:It is better to use two cells and align the content, than using large padding and &nbsp;'s.After doing many tests in Litmus, i could not find a way to have perfect rendering in all emails readers, but here is the better solution i found :In this piece of code, i aimed to emulate padding : 6px 12px;There are 2 "12px table columns" that handles the right and left padding.And I'm using "padding: 6px 0;" on my td content, to manage top and bottom padding : Outlook 2010 and 2013 will ignore this and will use their own padding.The text won't be perfectly aligned in Outlook 2010 and Outlook 2013 (slightly too far from top) but it works with all other email readers i tried : Apple Mail, Gmail, Outlook 2011 (yes..), Hotmail, Yahoo and many more.Preview image : Outlook 2010 and 2013 previewPreview image : Gmail, Apple Mail and othershave you tried display:inline-block;?My solution is to use an empty / whichever is needed with a transparent spacer gif since padding isnt 100% supported.All styling including padding have to be added to a td not a span.Another solution put the text into <p>text</p> and define margins, and that should give the required padding.For example:In some cases we set border instead of padding and it works in outlook.

How can you specify cross-browser transform controls using jQuery since each browser seems to use its own methodology?Here is the code I am using for Firefox but I can't even get it to work. I think it's because there is no way to tell which transformation – scale, rotate, skew – to use.If you want to use a specific transform function, then all you need to do is include that function in the value. For example:Secondly, browser support is getting better, but you'll probably still need to use vendor prefixes like so:jsFiddle with example: http://jsfiddle.net/jehka/230/Setting a -vendor prefix that isn't supported in older browsers can cause them to throw an exception with .css. Instead detect the supported prefix first:That works in old browsers. I've done scale here but you could replace it with whatever other transform you wanted.If you're using jquery, jquery.transit is very simple and powerful lib that allows you to make your transformation while handling cross-browser compability for you.

It can be as simple as this : $("#element").transition({x:'90px'}).Take it from this link : http://ricostacruz.com/jquery.transit/I started using the 'prefix-free' Script available at http://leaverou.github.io/prefixfree so I don't have to take care about the vendor prefixes. It neatly takes care of setting the correct vendor prefix behind the scenes for you. Plus a jQuery Plugin is available as well so one can still use jQuery's .css() method without code changes, so the suggested line in combination with prefix-free would be all you need:This will solve the issue

I like to work in ems when creating websites. Therefore I set a default font-size of 100.01% on the body element.My question is should I set the default font-size on the body or the html element? What are the pros and cons (if any) of both?Now that the rem unit is starting to become popular, setting the base font-size on the root element (html tag) is advised (rem stands for root em).I don't believe there is any advantage or disadvantage to setting the base font-size on either html or body to allow for sizing with ems; they will both have the same effect.Not related to the question:I would however suggest using a different default font-size. I would set it as:Doing this reduces the default font-size from 16px down to 10px. This then makes choosing font-size much easier as there is no need for difficult calculations. It means that 1em is equal to 10px and so calculating the px size is a matter of multiplying by 10:If you really want to follow the rules and still keep flexibility, you should consider this:So that is how it looks in CSS:Note that, while all page's elements should inherit from the body definition, you could use an all-tag-inclusive definition instead, like often seen in HTML resets:I don't recommend this reset however.

Judging by the resolution given here, it seems they wanted to prevent syntactic ambiguities that could arise from using - without whitespace, especially with keyword values such as min-content (although AFAIK keyword values aren't yet allowed within calc() — correct me if I'm wrong).Not everyone agrees with this resolution, though.The Mozilla Developer Network explains it quite well:I think you should first consider how do CSSs identify a length. A length is defined as an optional sign followed by a module and an optional unit of measure (although many properties actually require it):So, for example, valid CSS lengths are:Defining a length like this, the CSS engine parses the following:as a length followed by another length. In this case it would be 100% followed by -1px, which doesn't make sense to calc() at all. This is also explained in the relative MDN documentation page.In order to put two lengths in relation you need to use a distinct operator, therefore, following the above logic, you'll need to use whitespaces:

The following example doesn't work:HTML:CSS:Fiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/wNKcU/4/It wasn't working because your image was too big - there are restrictions on the image dimensions.

What Josh Crozier answered is correct, but for IE .cur and .ani are the only supported formats for this. So you should probably have a fallback just in case:NOTE 1: 

In some cases you should consider setting the offset (anchor):cursor:url(http://www.javascriptkit.com/dhtmltutors/cursor-hand.gif) 10 3, auto;in this exmple, we set offsetx to 10 and offsety to 3 (from top left), so the pointer finger will be anchor.

The server hosting the font is sending the proper content-type="application/vnd.ms-fontobject"I've tried multiple fonts, so it's not specific to the font.The fonts were generated over at Font Squirrelhttp://gregnettles.net/dev/font-face-test.htmlI know this is an old thread but I just had to weigh in. We had the same issue with EOT and WOFF fonts in all versions of Internet Explorer (7-11) not loading over HTTPS. After hours of trial and error and comparing our headers with other working sites we found it was the vary header that was messing things up. Unsetting that header for those file types fixed our issue right away.I ran into this problem with HTTPS, but not HTTP. For some reason IE would continue through the different font options, ignoring 200 OK responses.In my case, the problem was the HTTP header Cache-Control: no-cache for the font. While this will work fine with HTTP, over HTTPS it causes Internet Explorer to ignore the downloaded font.My best guess is that it's a variation of this behaviour:So, if you're seeing IE work through each font in the Developer Tools network view, it might be worth checking if you have a Cache-Control header and removing it.This usually happens due to following response headers while downloading the .woff or .eot files.In My case I am using spring-boot and to remove these header I had to do following . which solved the issue as well.Here is my fix:Using the URL Rewrite Addon for IIS to set Cache-Control header for all EOT files:Without cache headers, I have noticed that IE9 clients on Windows Vista still do not load fonts (even though on my newer development machine IE11 in IE9 emulation mode does so).I was able to fix the issue on the client machines, in the Internet Explorer, by going to:And unchecking the「Do not save encrypted pages to disk」option.HTHI seem to remember certain versions of IE cannot use an @fontface font hosted outside the site's domain (If the page is at http://a.domain.tld/page.html - font must also be in the http://a.domain.tld/) for one reason or another. Put the EOT file on your domain and try again maybe.IE9 blocks download of cross-origin web fontWorking solution for Apache/2.2.15 is to add .htaccessThis issue has now been resolved by adding the following entries to the httpd.conf or .htaccess in apache server.In order to get it to work we have changed from using FilesMatch to LocationMatch and now the headers are being set perfectly.Did you try directly downloading the EOT file over https? The SSL certificate appears to be bad (mismatched), which could very well be your problem.You should also make sure that there is a cross-domain policy set up for those files so while it may not be a factor in this issue, it could cause problems for certain browsers.This sounds like a problem with your CDN. You can verify this by changing your host file to have your SSL domain point to whatever IP your non-SSL traffic is served over. If the font renders, you'll need to call up your CDN and figure out what their servers are doing to font files.I Faced a similar issue, but it was the Vary header that was the culprit. In my setup I was using Ruby on Rails with the rack-cors gem. It was giving the font files a header of Vary: Origin. To fix this you can set the header to Accept-Encoding where you set up the middleware: Try full URLs with https://... . As https is slower because of the enlarging and uncompressable files, there are some tricks to deliver mixed http/https content, without getting an "insecure content" warning. You might search for them. Never needed to use such tricks.Ok, as far as I can tell this is an IE8 bug.  I created a workaround that at least works on Apache - use mod_rewrite to force HTTP for requests ending in '.eot' or '.eot?' and force HTTPS for all other requests.  In your .htaccess file, do:Not exactly pretty and I'm sure it adds some server overhead, running the string comparison every single request, but it fixes the issue :)Hi I've just run into the same problem and I've found a fix, hope this can help others. It is a bug in IE <= 8 as commented. You can see some information on the problem here https://communities.bmc.com/thread/88899. Basically the problem is downloading a file in IE over https with Cache: no-cache headers being set, try remove the cache headers to see if that is your problem.This answer may also help IE : Unable to download * from *. Unable to open this Internet site. The requested site is either unavailable or cannot be foundWanted to share my situation and solution in hopes it helps the next person.My fonts were being delivered over HTTPS via Amazon CloudFront, which was configured to serve static assets from our application that lives behind an Elastic Load Balancer.The fonts had the following headers:Based on other answers and things I could find on the internet, I would've expected this to work, since it was setting a max-age and had proper CORS configuration.  However, IE9 still would not render the fonts.The issue turned out to be the Cache-Control: no-cache="set-cookie" header, which surprised me because that just says to not cache the Set-Cookie header (unless I'm mistaken).It took me awhile to figure out where that header was coming from.  This header was being added by our ELB because we are using sticky sessions via cookies, and I guess the load balancer is configured to use this Cache-Control header when it is setup that way.So turning off sticky sessions removed the header, and caused the fonts to render.  We were able to turn off sticky sessions for HTTP requests, and leave them on for HTTPS requests, which is fine because we force SSL for any non-static assets, but happily serve static assets to CloudFront with or without SSL.Hope someone else can find this information useful.Quite old question, but I think no one answered correctly. The problem is that the font has been loaded from another file and for me this seems to be a case for Access-Controll-Allow-Origin.It's working pretty much straigth forward add the following in your virtualhosts file or in .htaccess:and restart the apacheUsing web font with IE 11 over HTTPS can be problem while using HTTP works fine. There are only specific version of IE 11 affected, e.g. Both are IEs on Win 7. I haven't seen the problem on Win 8 or Win 10.Even though Google states to support Microsoft Internet Explorer version 6+, their fonts are affected in the same way as described above.Currently I know of no workaround, not even a way of detecting affected versions via HTML/CSS/JavaScript.

No option scales the image better:

http://www.maxrev.de/html/image-scaling.htmlI've tested FF14, IE9, OP12 and GC21. Only GC has a better scaling that can be deactivated through image-rendering: -webkit-optimize-contrast. All other browsers have no/poor scaling.Screenshot of the different output: http://www.maxrev.de/files/2012/08/screenshot_interpolation_jquery_animate.pngUpdate 2017Meanwhile some more browsers support smooth scaling:No support in IE9-IE11. The -ms-interpolation-mode setting worked only in IE6-IE8, but was removed in IE9.P.S. Smooth scaling is done by default. This means no image-rendering option is needed!Late answer but this works:https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/CSS/image-renderingHere is another link as well which talks about browser support:https://css-tricks.com/almanac/properties/i/image-rendering/One way to "normalize" the appearance in the different browsers is using your "server-side" to resize the image. An example using a C# controller:where WebImage is a class in System.Web.Helpers.WebImageExtension is defined below:note the option InterpolationMode.HighQualityBicubic. This is the method used by Chrome.Now you need publish in a web page. Lets going use razor:And this worked very fine to me!Ideally will be better to save the image beforehand in diferent widths, using this resize algorithm, to avoid the controller process in every image load.(Sorry for my poor english, I'm brazilian...)Your problem is that you are relying on the browser to resize your images. Browsers have notoriously poor image scaling algorithms, which will cause the ugly pixelization.You should resize your images in a graphics program first before you use them on the webpage.Also, you have a spelling mistake: it should say moz-crisp-edges; however, that won't help you in your case (because that resizing algorithm won't give you a high quality resize: https://developer.mozilla.org/En/CSS/Image-rendering)You should try to maintain a proper aspect ratio between the sizes you're scaling from and to. For example, if your target size is 28px, then your source size should be a power of that, such as 56 (28 x 2) or 112 (28 x 4). This ensures you can scale by 50% or 25% rather than the 0.233333% you're currently using.I've seen the same thing in firefox, css transform scaled transparent png's looking very rough.I noticed that when they previously had a background color set the quality was much better, so I tried setting an RGBA background with as low an opacity value as possible.This worked for me, give it a try.Some people said that an even fraction downsize avoids the problem. I disagree.In IE11 I find that reducing an image by 50% (e.g. 300px to 150px) yields a jagged resize (like it's using nearest-neighbor). 

A resize to ~99% or 73% (e.g. 300px to 276px) yields a smoother image: bilinear or bicubic etc.In response I've been using images that are just retina-ish: maybe 25% bigger than would be used on a traditional 1:1 pixel mapping screen, so that IE only resizes a bit and doesn't trigger the ugliness. This is possible! At least now that css transforms have good support:You need to use a CSS transform to scale the image - the trick is not just to use a scale(), but also to apply a very small rotation. This triggers IE to use a smoother interpolation of the image:Seems Chrome downscaling is best but the real question is why use such a massive image on the web if you use show is so massively scaled down? Downloadtimes as seen on the test page above are terrible. Especially for responsive websites a certain amount of scaling makes sense, actually more a scale up than scale down though. But never in such a (sorry pun) scale.Seems this is more a theoretical problem which Chrome seems to deal with nicely but actually should not happen and actually should not be used in practice IMHO.Remember that sizes on the web are increasing dramatically. 3 years ago, I did an overhaul to bring our 500 px wide site layout to 1000. Now, where many sites are doing the jump to 1200, we jumped past that and went to a 2560 max optimized for 1600 wide (or 80% depending on the content level) main content area with responsiveness to allow the exact same ratios and look and feel on a laptop (1366x768) and on mobile (1280x720 or smaller).Dynamic resizing is an integral part of this and will only become more-so as responsiveness becomes more and more important in 2013.My smartphone has no trouble dealing with the content with 25 items on a page being resized - neither the computation for resizing nor the bandwidth. 3 seconds loads the page from fresh. Looks great on our 6 year old presentation laptop (1366x768) and on the projector (800x600). Only on Mozilla Firefox does it look genuinely atrocious. It even looks just fine on IE8 (never used/updated since I installed it 2.5 years ago).

How to make user controls know about css classes in ASP.NET

[How to make user controls know about css classes in ASP.NET](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/34390/how-to-make-user-controls-know-about-css-classes-in-asp-net)

Since there are no header sections for user controls in asp.net, user controls have no way of knowing about stylesheet files. So css classes in the user controls are not recognized by visual studio and produces warnings. How can I make a user control know that it will relate to a css class, so if it is warning me about a non-existing css class, it means that the class really do not exist?Edit: Or should I go for a different design like exposing css classes as properties like "HeaderStyle-CssClass" of GridView?

For instance, you could doWhich would only collapse the vertical borders and leave the horizontal ones in tact, which is what it sounds like the OP was actually looking for.Note that border-spacing: 0 is not the same as border-collapse: collapse.

I suggest you hop on the train right now.Note that there are several flavors of unicode. Joel Spolsky gives an overview.

(Graph current as of Feb. 2012, see comment below for more exact values.)UTF-8 is supported everywhere on the web. Only in specific applications is it not. You should always use utf-8 if you can.The downside is that for languages such as chinese, utf-8 takes more space than, say, utf-16. But if you don't plan on going chinese, or even if you do go chinese then utf-8 is fine.The only cons against using utf-8 is that it takes more space compared to various encodings, but compared to western languages it takes almost no extra space at all, except for very special characters, and those extra bytes you can live with. We are in 2009 after all. ;)If you want world domination, use UTF-8 all the way, because this covers every human character available at the world, including Asian, Cyrillic, Hebrew, Arabic, Greek and so on, while ISO-8859 is only restricted to Latin characters. You don't want to have Mojibake.I find iso-8859-1 very useful on a couple of sites where I have clients sending me text files that were created in Word or Publisher, that I can easily insert into the midst of PHP code and not worry about it - especially where quotes are concerned. These are local, U.S. companies, there is literally no other difference in the text on the pages, and I see no disadvantage in using that character set on those particular pages. All others are UTF-8.

Patches are welcome! :)Here are another couple of choices: lesshat and clearlessAlso, this blog post compares 3 less libraries: less elements vs bootstrap vs lesshat.From the post, it seems like both bootstrap and lesshat beat less elements,however depending what you need you would choose between bootstrap and lesshat.PS:If you're just look looking for some basic mixins, and for you - a whole library is overkill - then maybe this post from css-ticks is more for you. I just launched {lessins}, it is a library of common mixins, similar to bootstrap.less or less elements, but with a focus exclusively on mixins (the others include some unecessary variables, that seem remnants of other projects.)I have also organized the mixins into bundles. Check it out: https://github.com/jdmiller82/-lessins-Old question, but right now Lots of Love for Less (3L) is far more complete and generic than Preboot née Bootstrap!Try Preboot. It is a pretty cool LESS library from a member of Bootstrap team.This is an old question but let me share this recently made Bootstrap3-LESSHAT Boilerplate. The Boilerplate has the LESS Hat Mixin Library (counterpart of Compass) set up as well as the Font Awesome Iconset.There's a new library called more-or-less which is similar lesshat but a lot faster since it does not use inline-javascript.

Just like lesshat it allows to use endless layers for e.g box-shadow or background-image.

It basically has all of the lesshat mixins plus a few other helpful functions.

This is my CSS & HTML. I want to make an image look like a circle. Everything works fine in IE8+, Google Chrome and Mozilla Firefox. But Safari is acting kinda strange. Here is a demo picture:

To illustrate the problem in Safari, let's begin with a plain image.Here we have an image of 100px x 100px. Adding a border of 3px increases the element dimensions to 106px x 106px:Now we give it a border radius of 20%:You can see it starts cropping from the outer boundary of the element, not from the image itself.Further increasing the magnitude to 50%:And changing the border color to white:You can now see how the issue arises.Because of such behavior of the browser, when creating an image in a circle with a border, we have to make sure both the image and the border are given a border radius. One way to ensure this is to separate the border from the image by placing the image inside a container, and apply border radius to both of them.And now we have a nice circle border around the image on Safari.See DEMO.Seems this one works:http://jsfiddle.net/qWdf6/82/Have you tried the longhand markup?It seems like there are some bugs on using the short-hand notation with some versions of Safari.Simple way i did was use rounded PNG images and apply a border and radius of 50%example : http://www.laugfs.lk/#ourbusinessJust simply use box-shadow if you don't care the old browsers.Try this by adding overflow: hidden; to the set of rules. This is an issue with all the webkit browsers:Instead of putting the border on the image itself, put it on the container. Make sure the border-radius is on both the image and the containerIf the image's border radius is set the same as its parent div, the accepted solution works fine for circular images but not rounded rectangles because the width of the image is less than that of its parent div and the border radius needs to be scaled in proportion to the image, otherwise the image will appear more rounded than the parent div and there will be a gap between the inside edges of the parent div and the outside edges of the image.However, if you can specify your div/image widths in absolute dimensions it's possible to set a border radius for the image so that it will fit exactly inside its parent div, by taking into account the border width.HTML:CSS:RESULT:

This solution was also tested in Internet Explorer 9 and Chrome 43 and the results were the same.But if you have a border with radius on a div and inside it you have dynamic content (like if you click on that div, it slides down and show some other content), and you want to redesign your border with the same radius, you can use an aux class that redraw the radius (but the hack is that if you don't change the colour of the border the webkit will not redraw it).Eg:do not use the position:relative|absolute style attribute for your overflow:hidden

I'd be willing to add a <span> in but I really don't want to add any more markup than that.Thanks!According to the CSS Flexible Box Layout Module, you can declare the a element as a flex container (see figure) and use align-items to vertically align text along the cross axis (which is perpendicular to the main axis).That is all you need to do is Browser support considerationsChromeFirefoxSet layout.css.flexbox.enabled to true.Alternatively you can still use Just know that this is not css3-flexbox and that it will not wrap.IECan someone check the IE syntax and add it here?

Below an example of using those display properties to make a menu:It works by setting display: inline-table; to all the <li>, and then applying display: table-cell; and vertical-align: middle; to the children <a>. This gives us the power of <table> tag without using it.This solution is useful if you do not know the height of your element.The compatibilty is very good (relative to caniuse.com), with Internet Explorer >= 8.Here's the general solution using just CSS, with two variations. The first centers vertically in the current line, the second centers within a block element.As I understand it, vertical-align applies only to inline-block elements, e.g., <img>. You have to change an element's display attribute to inline-block for it to work. In the example, the line height expands to fit the span. If you want to use a containing element, such as a <div>, set the line-height attribute to be the same as the height. Warning, you will have to specify line-height: normal on the contained <span>, or it will inherit from the containing element.with thanks to Vlad's answer for inspiration; tested & working on IE11, FF49, Opera40, Chrome53centers in all directions nicely even with text wrapping, line breaks, images, etc.I got fancy and made a snippet

pretty self-explanatory.

2010-05-11 19:03:13Z

pretty self-explanatory.Yes, an element can have one ID (which must be unique!) and multiple classes at the same time. To have multiple classes, use a space between them, here's an example:I would like to add that if you add both ID and a class that contradict each other, the ID will have higher priority.For example:CSS:HTML:Some txt string will be shown in blue and not in red.Yes. Self explanatory.Additionally, it's common to have more than one class IE - but only one ID per element, and each ID should only be used once per HTML page.Yes.In short, yes. Usually the class would be for styling and the id to allow direct manipulation by scripts.yes you can add id and class as well as a class and a id for a class and a id<h1 id="orange-text" class="pink-text blue-text">Hello World!</h1>

for two classes

<h1 class="orange-text" class="pink-text blue-text">Hello World!</h1>Yes, you can. But note that Id's must be unique within your html file, while classes can be used in multiples elements.

But you can use extensions such as LESS to help you achieve the same.No.You can use grouping selectors and/or multiple classes on a single element, or you can use a template language and process it with software to write your CSS. See also my article on CSS inheritance. I do not believe this is possible. You could add class1 to all elements which also have class2. If this is not practical to do manually, you could do it automatically with JavaScript (fairly easy to do with jQuery).Try this...Give the element an ID, and also a class Name. Then you can nest the #IDName.className in your CSS.Here's a better explanation

I have created a demo so you can understand. Any help would be great!http://jsfiddle.net/gxRC9/4/You need some JS to do scroll events.

Here's my edits:I know Coop has already answered this question, but here is a version which also tracks where in the document the div is, rather than relying on a static value:http://jsfiddle.net/gxRC9/16/JavascriptCSSCoop's answer is excellent.

However it depends on jQuery, here is a version that has no dependencies:HTMLCSSJS

(This uses eyelidlessness's answer for finding offsets in Vanilla JS.)Examplehttps://jsbin.com/walabebita/edit?html,css,js,outputCoops answer is a good, simple solution, however, once you apply the fixed class the page becomes that much shorter and content will "jump" up, and if page is of a length where the scroll distance is less than the height of the header element, it will appear to jump and not let you see the bottom of the page. The answer I found was to add a spacer div above the element that will become fixed (nav element in my case), and set it to the same height as the nav element, and set it to display none.When adding the .fixed class to the nav, show the .nav-spacer div, and when removing it, hide it.  Since the height of the page changes instantly I have set the duration to 0.HTMLCSSJavaScriptJust building on Rich's answer, which uses offset.I modified this as follows:In 2019 with CSS3 you can do this without Javascript at all. I frequently make sticky headers like this:Or just simply add a span tag with the height of the fixed header set as its height then insert it next to the sticky header:It works perfectly.The chosen solution did not fit well in my page. So this is a more advanced version that works with bootstrap.The javascriptThe CSSAnd the HTMLHopefully this one piece of an alternate solution will be as valuable to someone else as it was for me.

Situation:

In an HTML5 page I had a menu that was a nav element inside a header (not THE header but a header in another element).

I wanted the navigation to stick to the top once a user scrolled to it, but previous to this the header was absolute positioned (so I could have it overlay something else slightly).

The solutions above never triggered a change because .offsetTop was not going to change as this was an absolute positioned element. Additionally the .scrollTop property was simply the top of the top most element... that is to say 0 and always would be 0.

Any tests I performed utilizing these two (and same with getBoundingClientRect results) would not tell me if the top of the navigation bar ever scrolled to the top of the viewable page (again, as reported in console, they simply stayed the same numbers while scrolling occurred). Solution

The solution for me was utilizing The value of the pageTop property reflects the viewable section of the screen, therefore allowing me to track where an element is in reference to the boundaries of the viewable area.

This allowed a simple function assigned to the scroll event of the window to detect when the top of the navigation bar intersected with the top of the viewable area and apply the styling to make it stick to the top.Probably unnecessary to say, anytime I am dealing with scrolling I expect to use this solution to programatically respond to movement of elements being scrolled. 

 Hope it helps someone else.

Number 2 is out because I'm using Sass, not ERB to process the files.The following should do the trick:Rails in fact provides a bunch of helpers to reference the assets:In generalasset_type may be one of the following: image, font, video, audio, javascript, stylesheetsass-rails gem defines Sass functions that can be used from Sass, without ERB processing.

https://github.com/rails/sass-railsFor those who are in favor for faster load times for users, may I suggest following Steve Souders tip for loading images in CSS in base64.asset-data-url('path')https://github.com/rails/sass-rails#asset-helpersA variant of option 2 will work. If you have something like this:And you require it into your application.css file. Then pancakes_house goes through ERB first and that output goes through the LESS processor and whatever comes out of that goes into your CSS. Putting ERB inside your SCSS might feel a little odd but, hey, it'll work and get the job done without too much weirdness.So you should be able to get at the necessary methods to produce your cache-busting image paths through your ERB.I only tried this with a Less file but it should work with .css.scss.erb as well.As an aside, you can also add your own functions to SASS:There are even some instructions on writing your own functions a little further down in the manual. However, I'm not sure how to get Sprockets to load your Sass::Script::Functions patches so I can't call this a practical solution; someone with stronger Sprocket Fu than me might be able to make this approach work though and I'd call this more elegant than ERBified SCSS.You can use Number 2 easily, just add .erb extension to your .scss file:and use asset_path method to get path to image with hash:this file will be processed by erb and then by sass.When using the asset pipeline, paths to assets must be re-written and sass-rails provides -url and -path helpers (hyphenated in Sass, underscored in Ruby) for the following asset classes: image, font, video, audio, JavaScript and stylesheet.image-url("rails.png") returns url(/assets/rails.png)

   image-path("rails.png") returns "/assets/rails.png"The more generic form can also be used:asset-url("rails.png") returns url(/assets/rails.png)

I am working on a japanese website and have a hard time finding a font which looks good in japanese. I was surprised that so few fonts seem to exist for japanese. My team has contacted several web font providers without much success. Only one company could offer a web font for japanese but it was 35 megabytes which is far to big for the clients to download to their browsers.For Latin letters there are a few fonts which one can be quite confident almost all users have, like Arial, Verdana, TNR, Georgia and so on. What fonts equal these in japan?Web-font for Japanese, though there are few providers exist, is not really practical as you found the size of the font data is too big to download. Usually Japanese font has 8,000-16,000  glyph so making new fonts means you need to make at least 8,000 glyph, which is pretty heavy task. As a result of it, there are very few variations in Japanese fonts, and Japanese users also care about fonts less than Latin-character users.Most Japanese websites use default font sets provided on Windows or Mac. The latest ones are Meiryo and Hiragino Kaku Gothic Pro. For older versions such like Windows XP, it is good to add former default fonts MS Gothic(or MS Mincho)/Osaka.Some old browsers could not understand those font names in English, some others do not recognize the names in Japanese, so it is safe to write both in Japanese and English.Meiryo and Hiragino's order is, because Mac users may have Meiryo from MS-Office, and Hiragino is more familiar and matching well on Mac, better by starting Hiragino series.So the current recommended practice is like this,Fonts don't really have to be "web fonts" (woff) to be used on the web. I use several of these on my website:But here are some free Japanese web-fonts (that I also use):I am no font/design expert, but just about every Japanese PC should have basic Latin fonts like the ones you mentioned installed, so they will work. But those fonts give a kind of Western look to Japanese characters. If you want to use fonts that Japanese sites typically use I would start by browsing some of the more popular Japanese sites and using things like Firebug or the Chrome developer tools to examine the CSS and see what fonts they reference. For example, yahoo.co.jp currently has this CSS:The "gothic" typeface fonts seem fairly popular these days: on Windows, fonts like MS Gothic, MS PGothic, etc. Ming typeface is also widely used. These are the default browser font settings for Firefox on my Japanese Windows machine:The proportional font is the sans-serif font, which is MS PGothic, serif font is MS PMing, and the monospace font is MS Gothic.BTW, the "Osaka" font was a standard font on Japanese Macs in the 90s. Unless you want that "retro" feel, is highly recommended to use "Hiragino Sans" (not Kaku Gothic that's deprecated) for macOS and iOS devices for a consistent and modern look and better legibility. Also Hiragino Sans has far more font weights (10) than Kaku Gothic (only 2).This is an old thread but for anyone doing research on this now, you should note that Meiryo is no longer a standard font loaded with Windows. Since Windows 10, the new default font is Yu Gothic. You can still install Meiryo manually however. Please see this articleThis is an old thread, but I was researching this today and found that Noto Sans is production ready (something I had read about a few years ago).I've tried it out in Japanese and it looks really good, link here: https://www.google.com/get/noto/The Japanese font is called 'Noto Sans CJK JP' (China/Japan/Korea Japan) if you do not wish to download the whole package.'Noto Sans CJK JP' is also available for Ubuntu linux. It is provided as an official package "fonts-noto-cjk". Still manual installation is required, it is expected to have it installed on Japanese Ubuntu machines.For whom may come in the future, there is a great (long and deep) article on this very matter written by a japanese copywriter: The Most Comprehensive Guide to Web Typography in Japanese.For instance:So, it's not only a matter on quantity, but also on pixels per character. Quite obvious now.

Bootstrap 4 card-deck with number of columns based on viewport

As of Bootstrap 4 Alpha 6, flexbox is default so the additional CSS is not required for flexbox, and the h-100 class can be used to make the cards full height: http://www.codeply.com/go/gnOzxd4SpkRelated question: 

Bootstrap 4 - Responsive cards in card-columnsHere's a solution with Sass to configure the number of cards per line depending on breakpoints: https://codepen.io/migli/pen/OQVRMwIt works fine with Bootstrap 4 beta 3EDIT (2019/10)I worked on another solution which uses horizontal lists group + flex utilities instead of card-deck:https://codepen.io/migli/pen/gOOmYLbIt's an easy solution to organize any kind of elements into responsive gridI got this to work by adding a min-width to the cards:The cards don't go below this width, but still properly fill each row and have equal heights.I created 4 cards and place this code between second and third card, try this.I've used CSS Grid to fix that.

CSS Grid will make all the elements in the same row, all the same height.I haven't looked into making all the elements in all the rows the same height though.Anyway, here's how it can be done:HTML:CSS:Here's a complete JSFiddle.

https://jsfiddle.net/bluegrounds/owjvhstq/4/This answer is for those who are using Bootstrap 4.1+ and for those who care about IE 11 as wellCard-deck does not adapt the number visible of cards according to the viewport size.Above methods work but do not support IE. With the below method, you can achieve similar functionality and responsive cards.You can manage the number of cards to show/hide in different breakpoints.In Bootstrap 4.1+ columns are same height by default, just make sure your card/content uses all available space.

Run the snippet, you'll understandI like Spanomaly's simple solution above of setting the min-width style. Note that it is applied to the card element.This also helps resolve another issue - having cards that aren't part of a full row being the same width as the ones that are. Simply set the max-width style to be the same as the min-width. Define columns by min width based on viewport:@Zim provided a great solution above (well deserved up-vote from me), however, it didn't quite fit what I needed since I was implementing this in Jekyll and wanted my card deck to automatically update every time I added a post to my site. Growing a card deck such as this with each new post is straight forward in Jekyll, the challenge was to correctly place the breakpoints. My solution make use of additional liquid tags and modulo mathematics.While this question is old, I came across it and found it useful, and maybe someday someone will come along wanting to do this with Jekyll.This whole code block can be used directly in a website or saved in your Jekyll project _includes folder.There's simpler solution for that - set fixed height of card elements - header and body. This way, we can set resposive layout with standard boostrap column grid. Here is my example:

http://codeply.com/go/RHDawRSBolIt took me a bit to figure this out, but the answer is to not use a card-deck, but instead to use .row and .cols.  This makes a responsive set of cards with specifics for each screen size: 3 cards for xl, 2 for lg and md, and 1 for sm and xs.  .my-3 puts a padding on top and bottom so they look nice.

What's the best way to ensure a table cell cannot be less than a certain minimum width. I want to ensure that all cells in a table are at least 100px wide regards of the width of the tables container. If there is more available space the table cells should fill that space.I possible I would like to find a solution that works inIn order of preference.This CSS should suffice:However, it's not always obeyed correctly (the min-width attribute) by all browsers (for example, IE6 dislikes it a great deal).Edit: As for an IE6 (and before) solution, there isn't one that works reliably under all circumstances, as far as I know.  Using the nowrap HTML attribute doesn't really achieve the desired result, as that just prevents line-breaks in the cell, rather than specifying a minimum width.However, if nowrap is used in conjunction with a regular cell width property (such as using width: 100px), the 100px will act like a minimum width and the cell will still expand with the text (due to the nowrap).  This is a less-than-ideal solution, which cannot be fully applied using CSS and, as such, would be tedious to implement if you have many tables you wish to apply this to.  (Of course, this entire alternative solution falls down if you want to have dynamic line-breaks in your cells, anyway).Another hack is the old 1x1 transparent pixel trick. Insert an 1x1 transparent gif image and set its width in the image tag to the width you want. This will force the cell to be at least as wide as the image.I know this is an old question but i thought I'd share something that wasn't mentioned (Although pretty simple in concept..) you can just put a <div> inside the table (in one of the <td>'s or something) and set the <div> to min-width. the table will stop at the <div>'s width. Just thought I'd throw that out there in case somebody comes across this on google. Also, I'm not so sure about how min-width is handled in I.E6. but that has already been covered in another answer.I had some success with:Based on a combination of Vatos' response and a min-height article here: http://www.dustindiaz.com/min-height-fast-hack/what about this css propertybut it doesn't really work in IE6 if not mistakenif you don't want to do it in the css way, I suppose you can add this attribute in your table data tagThis is a cross-browser way for setting minimum width and/or mimimum height:IE 6 doesn't understand !important

IE 6 sees width/height:200px (overwriting auto)Other browsers understand the min- and the !importantI am not 100% familiar with the behaviour of widths in TD elements, but this all works nicely on eg DIV tagsBTW:This is not working because of the order of the first 2 lines, they need to be in the right order (think about the above) ;)IE6 handles width as min-width:If you want IE6 to handle width like normal browsers, give it an overflow:visible; (not the case here)

But the above code doesn't work properly can anyone give an idea to implement this.Using contentWindow instead of contentDocument works for me:Also, ensure that the domains match and that you are using a webserver to test (I got a protocol warning when testing from the file system).One method that has always worked reliably for me is for the iFrame to give its parent a reference to its own window when it first loads.  The parent can then access all the variables through that reference.  This does require that the parent is loaded before the iFrame, but for me that is usually the case.So in the parent Then in the iFrame at some point after it has loaded and settled downThen, in the parent when it wants a global var contents from the iFramescript of iframe:script of parent window:Most of my knowledge on this topic comes from Ben Vinegar's talk on Seamless iFramesThis is a cross-domain "okay" method to deal wit this stuff.

What is the difference between pipe (|) and caret (^) attribute selectors?

At W3Schools they declare both | and ^ to mean: Select an element with an attribute starting with a specified value.So what's the difference?

2015-12-30 13:50:42Z

At W3Schools they declare both | and ^ to mean: Select an element with an attribute starting with a specified value.So what's the difference?Caret (^): selects an element (<h1>) where the value of the specified attribute (rel) starts with a certain value (val):Pipe (|): selects an element (<h1>) where the value of the specified attribute (rel) is either exactly the value (val) or starts with the value immediately followed by - (val-):More information about this selectors you can find here: https://css-tricks.com/attribute-selectors/ or on the official CSS specification: https://www.w3.org/TR/css3-selectors/#attribute-selectorsNo, the | is not used to select elements whose attribute value start with a certain value.Here is what the W3C Spec says about these selectors. (emphasis is mine)So, the | symbol in the attribute selector would select only elements whose attribute value is either exactly the given value or starts with the given value followed by a hyphen.As you can see in the below snippet, the attribute selector which uses | ([data-test |= 'val']) doesn't select the element when the attribute value is like valid whereas the attribute selector with ^ ([data-test ^= 'val']) does.In a more real-world scenario, the attribute selector with pipe (|) can be used to select elements and apply specific styling depending on their language (which can be set using the lang attribute). As we can see in the snippet, |= 'en' selects all elements whose lang attribute is either en or en-GB or en-US (or any other en-* for that matter). As the spec states, the primary intention of this selector was to allow language subcode matches but  as BoltClock points out, this has by and large been superseded by the :lang pseudo-class selector.(Translations were by Google. Any mistake was unintentional)Additional Information: The attribute selector which uses pipe (|) was introduced in CSS2 and the attribute selector which uses the cap/caret (^) was introduced in CSS3.Simply put:Expanded Info:Source: http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-selectors/#selectorsHTMLTesting the pipe (|) selector.Testing the caret (^) selector.Actually[attr ^= value] is value*

Caret (^) means starting with "value" (and obviously exact value as well)[attr |= value] is value OR value-* (i.e. [attr = value],[attr ^= value-])

Pipe (|) means either exact "value" or starting with "value-" (succeeded by dash (-))Example:

Does anybody know of a good way to replicate Photoshop's multiply layer mode using either an image or CSS?I'm working on a project that has thumbnails that get a color overlay when you hover over them, but the designer used a layer set to multiply and I can't figure out how to produce it on the web.The best thing I've come up with is either using rgba or a transparent png, but even then it doesn't look right.There are new CSS properties being introduced to do just this thing, they are blend-mode and background-blend-mode.Currently, you won't be able to use them in any sort of production environment, as they are very very new, and currently only supported by Chrome Canary (experimental web browser) & Webkit Nightly.These properties are set up to work nearly exactly the same as photoshop's blending modes, and allow for various different modes to be set as values for these properties such as overlay, screen, lighten, color-dodge, and of course multiply.. among others.blend-mode would allow images (and possibly content? I haven't heard anything to suggest that at this point though.) layered on top of each other to have this blending effect applied.background-blend-mode would be quite similar, but would be intended for background images (set using background or background-image) rather than actual image elements.EDIT:

The next section is becoming a bit irrelevant as browser support is growing.. Check this chart to see which browsers have support for this: http://caniuse.com/#feat=css-backgroundblendmodeIf you've got the latest version of Chrome installed on your computer, you can actually see these styles in use by enabling some flags in your browser (just throw these into your address bar:)Enable those bad boys and then check out this fiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/cqzJ5/

(If the styles are properly enabled in your browser, the two images should be blended to make the scene look like it is underwater)While this may not be the most legitimate answer at the current moment due to the almost entirely nonexistent support for this feature, we can hope that modern browsers will adopt these properties in the near future, giving us a really nice and easy solution to this problem.Some extra reading resources on blending modes and the css properties:Simple with a bit of SVG:and some CSS:The fiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/7uCQQ/381/Just for the record, this guy is developing a library to do so. I just came into it while doing a research, haven't tried yet.https://github.com/Phrogz/context-blenderIt is possible with a 24.png - if you know the trick.In illustrator you can export the graphic as a 24.png, but this never seems to work like multiply.I've found away.works just like a multiply when z-index(ed) on top of a picture.No such ability is available. The only compositing options you get that are even close are:Neither are really practical.In general you should not attempt to export Photoshop comps as layers, but render them down to a single opaque image. For rollovers you can make two images (one for normal state, one for hovered) and swap between them using the CSS :hover style to choose a different background image, or—better, as it requires no preloading and reduces HTTP requests—combine both images into one and use background-image/background-position to display the right part of that image in each state as a background image. (「CSS sprites」)I recently had the need to do exactly what the OP asked so I searched around. I found a great way to replicate the multiply effect by making a transparent PNG in Photoshop.All credit goes to Sojeong from https://superuser.com/questions/381704/multiply-blending-mode-to-pngCheck this out:

http://www.webdesign.org/photoshop/photoshop-basics/remove-white-using-channels.10545.htmlUsing those instructions, I had great success watermarking a black-and-white image (ink drawing in my case, with blacks and greys on a solid white background) onto a dark background (wood in my case). There is hardly any difference with the real Multiply filter of Adobe.I used the Photoshop instructions to remove the whites from my image, leaving only blacks and greys on a transparent background. Saving this to PNG and putting it on the wood in CSS/HTML still lookedmuch worse thanmultiply, but strongly reducing the brightness of the PNG solved it (the light greys stood out before, making it ugly).In general I recommend you play around in photoshop, replicating the web situation: a semi-transparent (no special stuff) layer on top of a solid background. Tutorials such as the above may allow you to reproduce multiply or other fancy effects.Not sure if you will have any luck. As far as I know, it isn't possible even if you tried to integrate some advanced JavaScript with it.

Are there any lists of default CSS stylesheets for different browsers? (browser stylesheets in tabular form)I want to know the default font of text areas across all browsers for future reference.Not tabular, but the source CSS may be helpful if you're looking for something specific:You're on your own with IE and Opera though.I suspect this is something of a moving target for all the browsers, but there is a default style sheet for HTML 4 as defined by the W3C.There probably is a list, this is why we use CSS Resets however.CSS class have compiled a list of CSS2.1 User Agent Style Sheet Defaults. Some links at the bottom of that page as well.You cannot possibly know all defaults for all configurations of all browsers into the future.The way people get around this is to start their CSS by resetting everything to known values.   Here's an example from one of the main CSS experts: http://meyerweb.com/eric/thoughts/2007/05/01/reset-reloaded/There was some discussion and testing done on www-style not too long ago:http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-style/2008Jul/0124.htmlhttp://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-style/2008Jul/att-0124/defaultstyles.htm

however, the result come out, the inner "UL" will hold some of the css which defined for its parent.

and even some of the css defined in "b" will be override by "a"... nightmare...how can i stop the inheritance???CSS:.moduleMenu-ul .moduleMenu-li a:hover {

    }lets say you have this:Now if you DONT need IE6 compatibility (reference at Quirksmode) you can have the following cssThe > is a direct children operator, so in this case only the first level of lis will be purple.Hope this helpsIf the inner object is inheriting properties you don't want, you can always set them to what you do want (ie - the properties are cascading, and so you can overwrite them at the lower level).e.g.In this case, "li-b" will still be bold even though you don't want it to be. To make it not bold you can do:Non-inherited elements must have default styles set.

If parent class set color:white and font-weight:bold style then no inherited child must set 'color:black' and font-weight: normal in their class. If style is not set, elements get their style from their parents.While this isn't currently available, this fascinating article discusses the use of the Shadow DOM, which is a technique used by browsers to limit how far cascading style sheets cascade, so to speak. He doesn't provide any APIs, as it seems that there are no current libraries able to provide access to this part of the DOM, but it's worth a look. There are links to mailing lists at the bottom of the article if this intrigues you.The short story is that it's not possible to do what you want here. There's no CSS rule which is to "ignore some other rule". The only way around it is to write a more-specific CSS rule for the inner elements which reverts it to how it was before, which is a pain in the butt.Take the example below:There's no way to make the .notBlue class revert to the parent styling. The best you can do is this:Using the wildcard * selector in CSS to override inheritance for all attributes of an element (by setting these back to their initial state).An example of its use:Override the values present in the outer UL with values in inner UL.you can load the new content in an iframe to avoid css inheritance.

Floating an image to the bottom right with text wrapping around

[Floating an image to the bottom right with text wrapping around](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/19770925/floating-an-image-to-the-bottom-right-with-text-wrapping-around)

I have a text container with paragraphs and headings. At the bottom of the page I want to float an image to the right of the page, while the text wraps around the image. The bottom of the image should be flush with the bottom of the last paragraph.The page width is variable (responsive), but the image dimensions are fixed. Is it possible to accomplish this in HTML and CSS (CSS3 is fine)? If not, can it be done with a minimal amount of Javascript?Here's a schematic example of what I want to accomplish:The HTML currently looks something like this, but it can be changed if necessary. I don't particularly care where in the document the image is located. Using background images instead would be fine too.When I set float: right on the image, it floats to the right but I cannot get it to align to the bottom of the page.

Suggestions?Edit: the closest I got is this... :-)Create a spacer element with float: right and height equal to the height of the content minus the height of the image.  Then use float: right and clear: right on the image:http://cssdesk.com/bLNWsMy demo uses fixed dimensions in the container element.  Since that is rarely a realistic case, it probably makes more sense to use JavaScript to size the spacer.  Call this function, passing a reference to the spacer element when the document is ready and during the window.onresize event.This function works (see the demo), and can be reworked for jQuery or your library of choice.  It's not meant to be plug-in quality code, but serves to illustrate the concept.jsfiddle.net/n5RPV/9Edit: I created a jQuery plugin version (github | jsFiddle demo) that supports floating bottom left or bottom right.  It also supports specifying which element to align the bottom with.By the way, I didn't bother trying to support IE7.I think the future way how to tackle this problem will be with CSS Exclusions.This msdn article also explains exclusions Ironically, to date this only works in IE10 (look for wrap-flow:both here) This is what the code looks like:So as you can see - even though the exclusion is positioned absolutely - it still acts like a float - in this case: float bottom right. Regarding browser support:Check out this site which shows which properties are supported by the browsers (to date: only IE10+ supports wrap-flow:both )PS: Latest updates concerning CSS exclusions (and other simlar modules like CSS regions and CSS Shapes) can be found at the Adobe Web Platform Team BlogI have worked on a jQuery-based solution — probably not as elegant as the one posted by gilly3 though ;) and it's also slower and a bit bloated...My trick is to append two <div>s to the section, which is floated to the left and hidden width a width of 0. One of the div, a designated ghost element that will have the same dimension as the image, will be positioned below another div that is the designated height spacer. The script uses a while loop to establish if the ghost element has reached the bottom of the parent section element. If this has not happened, it will increment the height of the height spacer by 1, until the condition is satisfied.The markup I have used is as follow. I'm using the HTML5 attribute data-bottom-image to identify sections that you have the image to be floated to the bottom. Of course it is dispensable, depending on how you want to select for the correct section element.And the jQuery script:And here is the working Fiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/teddyrised/xmkAP/5/Possible CSS Solution: (only tested in chrome)It looks like this might work using CSS3's flex box properties and a combination of background-image properties. I was able to get it pretty close using only CSS. (It works but needs a little tweaking) Also, this may not be ideal cause I did have to change the markup a little bit to make this work. But its probably worth a shot if you are looking for a pure CSS solution.Here is a Demo -> http://jsfiddle.net/ADSH2/New Markup: (not to much different)CSS:Resources: With a little bit of JavaScript and CSS I did it like this:http://jsfiddle.net/stichoza/aSScx/One simple floatify() function.Idea inspired by: http://www.csstextwrap.com/CSS only Solution.Using media queries one can accomplish this layout.HTMLCSSIt plays well at different screen resolutions.

When using -webkit-overflow-scrolling: touch it breaks the 3d perspective on iOS.See the demo on CodePen.HTMLCSS

Is there a workaround?Update, May 29Doh! I so stupid. The below, while true...ish doesn't address the question well enough.If you want that configuration of the rotation to stay the same as you have illustrated, add a div between .scroll and .el, and style it such:Thus, it would seem that you want the .pers div switched with .scroll or add another after .scroll with the same perspective.Also, try moving the perspective: 300px; to .scroll. The angle appears to change as one scroll up or down.Original AnswerThe answer is not really. One cannot contain a 3D transform inside a container with clipping which is being attempted here.The problem is overflow-y:scroll breaks the transform-style property as per spec. The overflow-y affects the nested element. If your problem persists, you may also have to use the -WebKit-transform-style: preserve-3d declaration on .scroll, though I think iOS already has a stacking context established in this case (Firefox requires this, Webkit seems not to).One solution is to remove your overflow:hidden from body and overflow-y:scroll from .scroll, but I suspect you are going to want to have that as a smaller part of the page/screen and move image blocks inside it.If this is the case, you will need fake this with transforms and some clever hackery and should use opacity be part of this endeavor, please note that this too (as in spec above, right below the transform-style) causes the flattening effect when not applied to the final node. Let's say you had opacity other than 1 on .el, you are fine here as .el is the final node, but if opacity was applied to .scroll, the same flattening of .el occurs as with the overflow.Have yet to test on iOS as I lack access to the device.Note: setting an overflow value other than visible for the body does not cause this issue on most desktop browsers that support 3D transforms. I do not know about iOS/mobile.The shared snippet does not work on Mozilla Firefox as well. Below is the solution tested for iOS Safari/Chrome (iPhone-6S), Windows Mozilla/Chrome:no need to use -webkit-overflow-scrolling. There could be a possible bug for this feature as it is under development  [Reference Link]. Removing this property generates the desired behavior. It might not be the exact solution, but it can act as a workaround.Codepen: http://codepen.io/anon/pen/LxZZdXThis snippet from HERE   might do it. They seem to have had this issue as wellPlease check this demo: http://codepen.io/tushar-chauhan/pen/yNgzem

You can try tweaking the values to get your desired results. This works on both mobile & desktop Safari. I am posting the HTML & CSS here too:

NVD3 chart fails to calculate legend text length in Chrome, since Window.getComputedStyle does not return font-size correctly

I created an integration of NVD3 charts into Eclipse-RAP using its custom widget framework. The chart is generated into a div. The CSS is loaded dynamically by creating a link entry in javascript. I check if the CSS is already loaded by creating an SVG/text element, and I check if its font-size is ok or not (see https://stackoverflow.com/a/7997710/337621). If the CSS is loaded, I create the chart.For some reason the chart is not rendered always correctly in Chrome. Usually first time in my session it is shown correctly, but second time it is rendered always wrong. For the wrong case I have found this in the console:If I make the chart redraw (for example by updating the chart data or resizing), the legend is rendered correctly.Expected:

Wrong layout:

After some debugging I have found the relevant d3 code part. NVD3 asks for the font size for an SVG Text element using this function:The relevant CSS part is this:I added the following "printpoint" (conditional breakpoint, which never stops, but prints out values) on the line with the getComputedStyle call:The result is really weird. If the chart is correct, I find this in the console for correct layout:

And this for wrong layout:

This is the DOM for the wrong layout:How can it be that once my SVG/Text has no font-size in computed style BUT it always has the font-size in one of the applied CSS rules?Is there some known bug in Chrome for this?Note, that in Firefox everything works fine.Chrome 39.0.2171.71 (64-bit)Kubuntu 3.13.0-29-genericI thought I am affected by this "behaviour" of the browsers : How can I change the default behavior of console.log? (*Error console in safari, no add-on*) . This means that the console does not show the state of the object at the time point of the log entry, but refers to the current state. So I made a small experiment here: http://jsfiddle.net/hdv7ty6L/ . I change the class from javascript and I check if the rule list changes in the console or not. And it seems to be a snapshot of the rule list. So still no clue, what is wrong here :)Test code:Console output:

The problem happens also if the CSS is completely static and not loaded dynamically.I tried to reproduce it in a jsfiddle: dynamicly created SVG inside a div with asynchronously created chart (onclick of a button). The error does not show up unfortunately. https://jsfiddle.net/ewsb4d9k/1/

Maybe assign an id or class on load, then define your styles using a static stylesheet.Have you noticed anything weird prior to the legend text length breaking? Does removing the legend and font css work 100% of the time?I noticed you're using adblock. It's worth a shot to disable it, if you haven't already. That plugin does crazy things sometimes.Have you tried a full dom refresh, or container refresh, on load? What happens with this? Does it render 100% of the time? Still fail?as shown from Timo in this thread jquery's append not working with svg element?It doesn't look like you were working with jQuery on this but it might be useful for testing in this case.Sorry to hear about your crazy bug. Hope you find a solution.

When sending an HTML email can you link to an external style sheet or does the CSS need to be included in the email?Also, if you can link to an external style sheet, which way is more efficient/is smarter to use: linking to the style sheet or including it in the HTML?Can you?  Yes.  Should you? No.  Most likely the email client will block external links and therefore your mail will not appear as you think it should.If you must send html mail, embed everything into the email message itself.  External links which automatically call back to the home server to load additional resources are one thing spam filters don't like.Forget efficient. Forget smart. Forget maintainable. This is HTML mail we're talking about.HTML mail and Webmail clients are extremely limited, partly for security reasons but mainly because they're just rubbish.

External style sheets almost certainly won't work. HTML-embedded style sheets probably won't work. Inline style="..." attribute on every damn element... has a much better chance of working, but still, don't be surprised when many users can't see styles at all, or some styles don't work, or some basic HTML doesn't work, and the content ends up looking like a 1997 browser threw up all over it.HTML mail is an exercise in unpleasantness. I hate to receive it. I hate even more to author it. The sanest route for everyone is to forget HTML mail and just send a plain text message including a link to a full web page, where you can have as much CSS, JavaScript and Flash loveliness as you like.You're best off embedding the CSS in your HTML.I believe inline styles (added in a style attribute on each element) are more widely supported than including a <style> section, too.I just Googled and came across this tutorial - looks pretty good at first glance... http://articles.sitepoint.com/article/code-html-email-newsletters

I would use Bootstrap's grid to achieve the desired result.  The class="img-responsive" works nicely. Something like:Use Nesting column To nest your content with the default grid, add a new .row and set of .col-sm-* columns within an existing .col-sm-* column. Nested rows should include a set of columns that add up to 12 or fewer (it is not required that you use all 12 available columns).

draw diagonal lines in div background with CSS

I have a div for a preview box:HTML:CSS:note: with CSS only if possibleThank you in advance.

2013-08-02 08:41:21Z

I have a div for a preview box:HTML:CSS:note: with CSS only if possibleThank you in advance.You can do it something like this:Here is a jsfiddle.Improved version of answer for your purpose.Almost perfect solution, that automatically scales to dimensions of an element would be usage of CSS3 linear-gradient connected with calc() as shown below. Main drawback is of course compatibility. Code below works in Firefox 25 and Explorer 10 and 11, but in Chrome (I've tested v30 and v32 dev) there are some subtle problems with lines disappearing if they are too narrow. Moreover disappearing depends on the box dimensions – style below works for div { width: 100px; height: 100px}, but fails for div { width: 200px; height: 200px} for which in my tests 0.8px in calculations needs to be replaced with at least 1.1048507095px for diagonals to be shown and even then line rendering quality is quite poor. Let's hope this Chrome bug will be solved soon.You can use SVG to draw the lines.Have a play here: http://jsfiddle.net/tyw7vkvmAll other answers to this 3-year old question require CSS3 (or SVG). However, it can also be done with nothing but lame old CSS2:Rather than actually drawing diagonal lines, it occurred to me we can instead color the so-called negative space triangles adjacent to where we want to see these lines. The trick I came up with to accomplish this exploits the fact that multi-colored CSS borders are bevelled diagonally:To make things fit the way we want, we choose an inner rectangle with dimensions 0 and LINE_THICKNESS pixels, and another one with those dimensions reversed:Finally, use the :before and :after pseudo-selectors and position relative/absolute as a neat way to insert the borders of both of the above rectangles on top of each other into your HTML element of choice, to produce a diagonal cross. Note that results probably look best with a thin LINE_THICKNESS value, such as 1px.Please check the following.JS:CSS:jsfiddleyou can use a CSS3 transform Property:Xdeg = your valueFor example...You can make more div and use a z-index property.

So,make a div with line, and rotate it.If you'd like the cross to be partially transparent, the naive approach would be to make linear-gradient colors semi-transparent. But that doesn't work out good due to the alpha blending at the intersection, producing a differently colored diamond. The solution to this is to leave the colors solid but add transparency to the gradient container instead:intrepidis' answer on this page using a background SVG in CSS has the advantage of scaling nicely to any size or aspect ratio, though the SVG uses <path>s with a fill that doesn't scale so well.I've just updated the SVG code to use <line> instead of <path> and added non-scaling-stroke vector-effect to prevent the strokes scaling with the container:Here's that dropped into the CSS from the original answer (with HTML made resizable):I needed to draw arbitrary diagonal lines inside any div. My issue with the other answers posted is that none of them allowed to draw an arbitrary line from point A to point B without doing the trigonometry yourself for the angles. With javascript & CSS you can do this. Hope it's helpful, just specify a pair of points and you're golden.Here is how I did this using the css clip-path property alongside relative and absolute positioning to create a more fancy cross.Here is a link to the code on codepen if you'd like to tweak it.

2011-02-05 03:25:26Z

I know it is possible to link an entire table cell with CSS.Is there a way to apply a link to an entire table row? I agree with Matti. Would be easy to do with some simple javascript. A quick jquery example would be something like this:and

then in your CSSUse the ::before pseudo element. This way only you don't have to deal with Javascript or creating links for each cell. Using the following table structureall we have to do is create a block element spanning the entire width of the table using ::before on the desired link (.rowlink) in this case.demoThe ::before is highlighted in red in the demo so you can see what it's doing.Unfortunately, no. Not with HTML and CSS. You need an a element to make a link, and you can't wrap an entire table row in one.The closest you can get is linking every table cell. Personally I'd just link one cell and use JavaScript to make the rest clickable. It's good to have at least one cell that really looks like a link, underlined and all, for clarity anyways.Here's a simple jQuery snippet to make all table rows with links clickable (it looks for the first link and "clicks" it)Example: http://xxjjnn.com/linktablerow.htmlLink entire row:Iff you'd like to do highlight on mouseover for the entire row, then:with something like the following for css, which will remove the gap between the table cells and change the background on hover:Iff you are using Rails 3.0.9 then you might find this example code useful:Sea has many Fish, Fish has many Scales, here is snippet of app/view/fish/index.erbwith @fishies and @sea are defined in app/controllers/seas_controller.rbAlso it depends if you need to use a table element or not. You can imitate a table using CSS and make an A element the rowcss:I feel like the simplest solution is sans javascript and simply putting the link in each cell (provided you don't have massive gullies between your cells or really think border lines). Have your css:and then add a link per cell:boring but clean.To link the entire row, you need to define onclick function on your row, which is <tr>element and define a mouse hover in the CSS for tr element to make the mouse pointer to a typical click-hand in web:In table:In related CSS:
