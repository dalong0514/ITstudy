I found a way to make a div container to occupy at least full height of a page, by setting min-height: 100%;. However, when I add a nested div and set height: 100%;, it doesn't stretch to container's height. Is there a way to fix it?This is a reported webkit (chrome/safari) bug, children of parents with min-height can't inherit the height property: https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=26559 Apparently Firefox is affected too (can't test in IE at the moment)Possible workaround:The bug doesn't show when the inner element has absolute positioning.See http://jsfiddle.net/xrebB/Edit on April 10, 2014Since I'm currently working on a project for which I really need parent containers with min-height, and child elements inheriting the height of the container, I did some more research.First: I'm not so sure anymore whether the current browser behaviour really is a bug. CSS2.1 specs say: If I put a min-height on my container, I'm not explicitly specifying its height - so my element should get an auto height. And that's exactly what Webkit - and all other browsers - do.Second, the workaround I found:If I set my container element to display:table with height:inherit it acts exactly the same way as if I'd give it a min-height of 100%. And - more importantly - if I set the child element to display:table-cell it will perfectly inherit the height of the container element - whether it's 100% or more.Full CSS:The markup:See http://jsfiddle.net/xrebB/54/.Add height: 1px to parent container. Works in Chrome, FF, Safari.thought I would share this, as I didnt see this anywhere, and is what I used to fix my solution.SOLUTION: min-height: inherit;I had a parent with a specified min height, and I needed a child to also be that height.This way the child now acts as height 100% of the min-height. I hope some people find this useful :)This was added in a comment by @jackocnr but I missed it. For modern browsers I think this is the best approach.It makes the inner element fill the whole container if it's too small, but expands the container's height if it's too big.Kushagra Gour's solution does work (at least in Chrome and IE) and solves the original problem without having to use display: table; and display: table-cell;. See plunker: http://plnkr.co/edit/ULEgY1FDCsk8yiRTfOWUSetting min-height: 100%; height: 1px; on the outer div causes its actual height to be at least 100%, as required. It also allows the inner div to correctly inherit the height. In addition to the existing answers, there is also viewport units vh to use. Simple snippet below. Of course it can be used together with calc() as well, e.g. min-height: calc(100vh - 200px); when page header and footer have 200px height together.I don't believe this is a bug with browsers. All behave the same way - that is, once you stop specifying explicit heights, min-height is basically a "last step".It appears to be exactly how the CSS 2.1 spec suggests:

http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/visudet.html#the-height-propertyTherefore, as the min-height parent does not have an explicit height property set, it defaults to auto.There are some ways around this possibly by using display: table-cell, or newer styles such as flexbox, if that is possible for your targeted audience's browsers. You can also subvert this in certain situations by using the top and bottom properties on an absolutely positioned inner element, which gives you 100% height without specifying so.For googlers:This jquery-workaround makes #containment get a height automatically (by, height: auto), then gets the actual height assigned as a pixel value.Although display: flex; has been suggested here, consider using display: grid; now that it's widely supported. By default, the only child of a grid will entirely fill its parent.The best way to achieve this nowadays is to use display: flex;. However you might run into an issue when trying to support IE11. According to https://caniuse.com using flexbox :The solution is to use display: table; on the parent and display: table-row; on the child both with height: 100%; as a replacement for min-height: 100%;.Most of the solutions listed here use display: table, table-row and/or table-cell, but they don't replicate the same behaviour as min-height: 100%;, which is:While using this solution, the behaviour is the same and the property min-height is not needed which allows to get around the bug.The reason why it works is because, unlike most elements, elements using display: table and table-row will always be as tall as their content. This makes their height property behave similarly to min-height.Another JS solution, that is easy and can be used to avoid a non-easy CSS-only or extra markup / hacky solution.W/ jQuery :Angular directive :To be used like this :Just to keep this subject complete, I found a solution not explored Here using Fixed position.This usually works for me:This is what works for me with percentage-based height and parent still growing according to children height.

Works fine in Firefox, Chrome and Safari.after trying for ours! chrome understands that I want the child element to be 100% height when I set the display value to inline block. btw setting float will causing it.updatethis is not working. the solution is to get the parentnode offsetheight and use it at the and of the page with javascript.

From what I've understood it would allow such a thing. Unfortunately, no browser seems to support it.What you can do is add some padding to the parent ul and pull the icon into that padding:Adjust the padding/font-size/etc to your liking, and that's it. Here's the usual fiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/joplomacedo/a8GxZ/=====This works with any type of iconic font. FontAwesome, however, provides their own way to deal with this 'problem'. Check out Darrrrrren's answer below for more details.As per the Font Awesome Documentation:Or, using Jade:I'd like to provide an alternate, easier solution that is specific to FontAwesome.  If you're using a different iconic font, JOPLOmacedo's answer is still perfectly fine for use.FontAwesome now handles list styles internally with CSS classes.Here's the official example:I wanted to add to JOPLOmacedo's answer. His solution is my favourite, but I always had problem with indentation when the li had more than one line. It was fiddly to find the correct indentation with margins etc. But this might concern only me.For me absolute positioning of the :before pseudo-element works best. I set padding-left on ul, negative position left on the :before element, same as ul's padding-left. To get the distance of the content from the :before element right I just set the padding-left on the li. Of course the li has to have position relative.

EDITI'll attempt to diagram what's happening:The long word breaks automatically, the short word doesn't.  I want it to look like this:Usewhere <parent-width> is the width of the parent element (or an arbitrary high value that doesn't fit into one line). That way you can be sure that there is even a line-break after a single letter. Works with Chrome/FF/Opera/IE7+ (and probably even IE6 since it's supporting word-spacing as well).The answer given by @HursVanBloob works only with fixed width parent container, but fails in case of fluid-width containers.I tried a lot of properties, but nothing worked as expected. Finally I came to a conclusion that giving word-spacing a very huge value works perfectly fine.or, for the modern browsers you can use the CSS vw unit (visual width in % of the screen size).An alternative solution is described on Separate sentence to one word per line, by applying display:table-caption; to the elementTry using white-space: pre-line;. It creates a line-break wherever a line-break appears in the code, but ignores the extra whitespace (tabs and spaces etc.).First, write your words on separate lines in your code: Then apply the style to the element containing the words.Be careful though, every line break in the code inside the element will create a line break. So writing the following will result in an extra line break before the first word and after the last word:There's a great article on CSS Tricks explaining the other white-space attributes.If you want to be able to choose from different solutions, in addition to the given answers...An alternative method is to give the container a width of 0 and to make sure overflow is visible. Then each word will overflow out of it and will be on its own line.Or you can use one of those newly proposed width values, provided those still exist by the time you read this.You can't target each word in CSS. However, with a bit of jQuery you probably could.With jQuery you can wrap each word in a <span> and then CSS set span to display:block which would put it on its own line.In theory of course :PI faced the same problem, and none of the options here helped me. Some mail services do not support specified styles.

Here is my version, which solved the problem and works everywhere I checked:OR using CSS:The best solution is the word-spacing property. Add the <p> in a container with a specific size (example 300px) and after you have to add that size as the value in the word-spacing.HTMLCSSIn this way, your sentence will be always broken and set in a column, but the with of the paragraph will be dynamic.Here an example Codepenhttps://jsfiddle.net/bm3Lfcod/1/For those seeking for a solution that works within a flexible parent container with a children that is flexible in both dimensions. eg. navbar buttons.In my case,worked perfecly, hope it helps any other newcomer like me.

Ever since switching from TABLE-layout to DIV-layout, one common problem remains:PROBLEM: you fill your DIV with dynamic text and inevitably there is a super-long word that extends over the edge of your div column and makes your site look unprofessional.RETRO-WHINING: This never happened with table layouts. A table cell will always nicely expand to the width of the longest word. SEVERITY: I see this problem on even the most major sites, especially on German sites where even common words such as "speed limit" are very long ("Geschwindigkeitsbegrenzung"). Does anyone have a workable solution to this?You can tell browsers where to split long words by inserting soft hyphen (&shy;):may be rendered asorA nice regular expression can ensure you won't be inserting them unless neccessary:Browsers and search engines are smart enough to ignore this character when searching text, and Chrome and Firefox (haven't tested others) ignore it when copying text to clipboard.Another option is to inject <wbr>, a former IE-ism, which is now in HTML5:Breaks with no hyphen:You can achieve the same with zero-width space character &#8203; (or &#x200B).FYI there's also CSS hyphens: auto supported by latest IE, Firefox and Safari (but currently not Chrome):However that hyphenation is based on a hyphenation dictionary and it's not guaranteed to break long words. It can make justified text prettier though.<table> for layout is bad, but display:table on other elements is fine. It will be as quirky (and stretchy) as old-school tables:overflow and white-space: pre-wrap answers below are good too.Two fixes:If (in the SO example) you want to stop it overlapping the padding, you'd probably have to create another div, inside the padding, to hold your content.Edit: As the other answers state, there are a variety of methods for truncating the words, be that working out the render width on the client side (never attempt to do this server-side as it will never work reliably, cross platform) through JS and inserting break-characters, or using non-standard and/or wildly incompatible CSS tags (word-wrap: break-word doesn't appear to work in Firefox).You will always need an overflow descriptor though. If your div contains another too-wide block-type piece of content (image, table, etc), you'll need overflow to make it not destroy the layout/design.So by all means use another method (or a combination of them) but remember to add overflow too so you cover all browsers.Edit 2 (to address your comment below):Start off using the CSS overflow property isn't perfect but it stops designs breaking. Apply overflow:hidden first. Remember that overflow might not break on padding so either nest divs or use a border (whatever works best for you).This will hide overflowing content and therefore you might lose meaning. You could use a scrollbar (using overflow:auto or overflow:scroll instead of overflow:hidden) but depending on the dimensions of the div, and your design, this might not look or work great.To fix it, we can use JS to pull things back and do some form of automated truncation. I was half-way through writing out some pseudo code for you but it gets seriously complicated about half-way through. If you need to show as much as possible, give hyphenator a look in (as mentioned below).Just be aware that this comes at the cost of user's CPUs. It could result in pages taking a long time to load and/or resize.This is a complex issue, as we know, and not supported in any common way between browsers. Most browsers don't support this feature natively at all.In some work done with HTML emails, where user content was being used, but script is not available (and even CSS is not supported very well) the following bit of CSS in a wrapper around your unspaced content block should at least help somewhat:In the case of Mozilla-based browsers, the XBL file mentioned above contains:Unfortunately, Opera 8+ don't seem to like any of the above solutions, so JavaScript will have to be the solution for those browsers (like Mozilla/Firefox.) Another cross-browser solution (JavaScript) that includes the later editions of Opera would be to use Hedger Wang's script found here:

http://list.opera.com/pipermail/opera-users/2004-November/024468.htmlCSS Cross Browser Word WrapUse the style word-break:break-all;. I know it works on tables. Do you mean that, in browsers that support it, word-wrap: break-word does not work ?If included in the body definition of the stylesheet, it should works throughout the entire document.If overflow is not a good solution, only a custom javascript could artificially break up long word.Note: there is also this <wbr> Word Break tag. This gives the browser a spot where it can split the line up. Unfortunately, the <wbr> tag doesn't work in all browsers, only Firefox and Internet Explorer (and Opera with a CSS trick).Just checked IE 7, Firefox 3.6.8 Mac, Firefox 3.6.8 Windows, and Safari:works for long links inside of a div with a set width and no overflow declared in the css:I don't see any incompatibility issuesI just found out about hyphenator from this question. That might solve the problem.After much fighting, this is what worked for me:Works in the latest versions of Chrome, Firefox and Opera.Note that I excluded many of the white-space properties the others suggested -- that actually broke the pre indentation for me.For me on a div without fixed size and with dynamic content it worked using:Re the regex in this comment, it's good, but it adds the shy hyphen only between groups of 5 non-whitespace-or-hyphen chars. That allows the last group be much longer than intended, since there's no matching group after it.For instance, this:...results in this:Here's a version using positive lookahead to avoid that problem:...with this result:The solution I usually use for this problem is to set 2 different css rules for IE and other browsers:woks perfect in IE, but word-wrap is not a standard CSS property. It's a Microsoft specific property and doesn't work in Firefox.For Firefox, the best thing to do using only CSS is to set the rulefor the element that contains the text you want to wrap. It doesn't wrap the text, but hide the part of text that go over the limit of the container. It can be a nice solution if is not essential for you to display all the text (i.e. if the text is inside an <a> tag)Update: Handling this in CSS is wonderfully simple and low overhead, but you have no control over where breaks occur when they do. That's fine if you don't care, or your data has long alphanumeric runs without any natural breaks. We had lots of long file paths, URLs, and phone numbers, all of which have places it's significantly better to break at than others.Our solution was to first use a regex replacement to put a zero-width space (&#8203;) after every 15 (say) characters that aren't whitespace or one of the special characters where we'd prefer breaks. We then do another replacement to put a zero-width space after those special characters.Zero-width spaces are nice, because they aren't ever visible on screen; shy hyphens were confusing when they showed, because the data has significant hyphens. Zero-width spaces also aren't included when you copy text out of the browser.  The special break characters we're currently using are period, forward slash, backslash, comma, underscore, @, |, and hyphen. You wouldn't think you'd need do anything to encourage breaking after hyphens, but Firefox (3.6 and 4 at least) doesn't break by itself at hyphens surrounded by numbers (like phone numbers).We also wanted to control the number of characters between artificial breaks, based on the layout space available. That meant that the regex to match long non-breaking runs needed to be dynamic. This gets called a lot, and we didn't want to be creating the same identical regexes over and over for performance reasons, so we used a simple regex cache, keyed by the regex expression and its flags.Here's the code; you'd probably namespace the functions in a utility package:Test like this:Update 2: It appears that zero-width spaces in fact are included in copied text in at least some circumstances, you just can't see them. Obviously, encouraging people to copy text with hidden characters in it is an invitation to have data like that entered into other programs or systems, even your own, where it may cause problems. For instance, if it ends up in a database, searches against it may fail, and search strings like this are likely to fail too. Using arrow keys to move through data like this requires (rightly) an extra keypress to move across the character you can't see, somewhat bizarre for users if they notice.In a closed system, you can filter that character out on input to protect yourself, but that doesn't help other programs and systems.All told, this technique works well, but I'm not certain what the best choice of break-causing character would be.Update 3: Having this character end up in data is no longer a theoretical possibility, it's an observed problem. Users submit data copied off the screen, it gets saved in the db, searches break, things sort weirdly etc.. We did two things:This works well, as does the technique itself, but it's a cautionary tale.Update 4: We're using this in a context where the data fed to this may be HTML escaped. Under the right circumstances, it can insert zero-width spaces in the middle of HTML entities, with funky results.Fix was to add ampersand to the list of characters we don't break on, like this:Need to set "table-layout: fixed」for word-wrap to workUPDATE: 

As of December, 2011, we now have another option, with the emerging support of these tags in FF and Safari:I've done some basic testing and it seems to work on a recent version of Mobile Safari and Safari 5.1.1.Compatibility table: https://developer.mozilla.org/en/CSS/hyphens#AutoCompatibilityTableFor compatibility with IE 8+ use:See it here http://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/prevent-long-urls-from-breaking-out-of-container/All I had to do was apply this to the style of the div container with a set width.Use thisIf you have this -just switch to a vertical format with containing divs and use min-width in your CSS instead of width -Of course, if you are displaying genuine tabular data it is ok to use a real table as it is semantically correct and will inform people using screen readers that is supposed to be in a table.

The page will give you a <link> element to include in your pages, and a list of sample font-family rules to use in your CSS. Using Google's fonts this way guarantees availability, and reduces bandwidth to your own server.There are TWO approaches that you can take to use licensed web-fonts on your pages:Using font hosting services along with @font-face declaration gives best output with respect to overall performance, compatibility and availability.Source: https://www.artzstudio.com/2012/02/web-font-performance-weighing-fontface-options-and-alternatives/UPDATEYou can now manually generate the Roboto fonts using instructions that can be found here.Old post, I know.This is also possible using CSS @import url:The src refers directly to the font files, therefore if you place all of them on /media/fonts/roboto you should refer to them in your main.css like this:

src: url('../fonts/roboto/Roboto-ThinItalic-webfont.eot');The .. goes one folder up, which means you're referring to the media folder if the main.css is in the /media/css folder.You have to use ../fonts/roboto/ in all url references in the CSS (and be sure that the files are in this folder and not in subdirectories, such as roboto_black_macroman).Basically (answering to your questions):You can leave it there, but be sure to use src: url('../fonts/roboto/If you want to refer to those files directly (without placing the subdirectories in your CSS code), then yes.Not necessarily, you can just include that code in your main.css. But it's a good practice to separate fonts from your customized CSS.Here's an example of a fonts LESS/CSS file I use:(In this example I'm only using the ttf)

Then I use @import "fonts"; in my main.less file (less is a CSS preprocessor, it makes things like this a little bit easier)This is what I did to get the woff2 files I wanted for static deployment without having to use a CDNTEMPORARILY add the cdn for the css to load the roboto fonts into index.html and let the page load.

from google dev tools look at sources and expand the fonts.googleapis.com node and view the content of the css?family=Roboto:300,400,500&display=swap file and copy the content.  Put this content in a css file in your assets directory.In the css file, remove all the greek, cryllic and vietnamese stuff.Look at the lines in this css file that are similar to:copy the link address and paste it in your browser, it will download the font.  Put this font into your assets folder and rename it here, as well as in the css file.  Do this to the other links, I had 6 unique woff2 files.I followed the same steps for material icons.Now go back and comment the line where you call the cdn and instead use use the new css file you created.Try thisUse /fonts/ or /font/ before font type name in your CSS stylesheet. I face this error but after that its working fine.Did you read the How_To_Use_Webfonts.html that's in that zip file?After reading that, it seems that each font subfolder has an already created .css in there that you can use by including this:it's easyevery folder of those you downloaded has a different kind of roboto font, means they are different fontsexample: "roboto_regular_macroman"to use any of them:1- extract the folder of the font you want to use2- upload it near the css file3- now include it in the css fileexample for including the font which called "roboto_regular_macroman":watch for the path of the files, here i uploaded the folder called "roboto_regular_macroman" in the same folder where the css isthen you can now simply use the font by typing font-family: 'Roboto';

I'm currently using readonly="readonly" to disable fields. I'm now trying to style the attribute using CSS. I've tried usingbut it is not working for some reason. I've also triedthat doesn't work either.How can I style the readonly attribute with CSS?https://curtistimson.co.uk/post/css/style-readonly-attribute-css/Note that textarea[readonly="readonly"] works if you set readonly="readonly" in HTML but it does NOT work if you set the readOnly-attribute to true or "readonly" via JavaScript.For the CSS selector to work if you set readOnly with JavaScript you have to use the selector textarea[readonly].Same behavior in Firefox 14 and Chrome 20.To be on the safe side, i use both selectors.To be safe you may want to use both...The readonly attribute is a "boolean attribute", which can be either blank or "readonly" (the only valid values). http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/#boolean-attributeIf you are using something like jQuery's .prop('readonly', true) function, you'll end up needing [readonly], whereas if you are using .attr("readonly", "readonly") then you'll need [readonly="readonly"].Correction:

You only need to use input[readonly]. Including input[readonly="readonly"] is redundant. See https://stackoverflow.com/a/19645203/1766230Loads of answers here, but haven't seen the one I use:Note the dash in the pseudo selector. If the input is readonly="false" it'll catch that too since this selector catches the presence of readonly regardless of the value. Technically false is invalid according to specs, but the internet is not a perfect world. If you need to cover that case, you can do this:textarea works the same way:Keep in mind that html now supports not only type="text", but a slew of other textual types such a number, tel, email, date, time, url, etc. Each would need to be added to the selector.There are a few ways to do this.The first is the most widely used. It works on all major browsers.While the one above will select all inputs with readonly attached, this one below will select only what you desire. Make sure to replace demo with whatever input type you want.This is an alternate to the first, but it's not used a whole lot:The :read-only selector is supported in Chrome, Opera, and Safari. Firefox uses :-moz-read-only. IE doesn't support the :read-only selector.You can also use input[readonly="readonly"], but this is pretty much the same as input[readonly], from my experience.Shoud cover all the cases for a readonly input field...If you select the input by the id and then add the input[readonly="readonly"] tag in the css, something like:That will not work. You have to select a parent class or id an then the input. Something like:My 2 cents while waiting for new tickets at work :DUse the following to work in all browsers:capitalize the first letter of Only

I am writing a page where I need an HTML table to maintain a set size. I need the headers at the top of the table to stay there at all times but I also need the body of the table to scroll no matter how many rows are added to the table. Think a mini version of excel. This seems like a simple task but almost every solution I have found on the web has some drawback. How can I solve this?I had to find the same answer. The best example I found is http://www.cssplay.co.uk/menu/tablescroll.html - I found example #2 worked well for me. You will have to set the height of the inner table with Java Script, the rest is CSS.I found DataTables to be quite flexible. While its default version is based on jquery, there is also an AngularJs plugin.I saw Sean Haddy's excellent solution to a similar question and took the liberty of making some edits:Sean did the heavy lifting, though. Thanks to Matt Burland, too, for pointing out need to support tfoot.Please see for yourself at http://jsfiddle.net/jhfrench/eNP2N/Have you tried using thead and tbody, and setting a fixed height on tbody with overflow:scroll?What are your target browsers?EDIT: It worked well (almost) in firefox - the addition of the vertical scrollbar caused the need for a horizontal scrollbar as well - yuck.  IE just set the height of each td to what I had specifed the height of tbody to be.  Here's the best I could come up with:What you need is :1) have a table body of limited height as scroll occurs only when contents is bigger than the scrolling window. However tbody cannot be sized, and you have to display it as a block to do so:2) Re-sync table header and table body columns widths as making the latter a block made it an unrelated element. The only way to do so is to simulate synchronization by enforcing the same columns width to both. However, since tbody itself is a block now, it can no longer behave like a table. Since you still need a table behavior to display you columns correctly, the solution is to ask for each of your rows to display as individual tables:(Note that, using this technique, you won't be able to span across rows anymore).Once that done, you can enforce column widths to have the same width in both thead and tbody. You could not that:I prefer the last option, which requires adding:See a demo here, forked from the answer to this question.Edit:   This is a very old answer and is here for prosperity just to show that it was supported once back in the 2000's but dropped because browsers strategy in the 2010's was to respect W3C specifications even if some features were removed: Scrollable table with fixed header/footer was clumsily specified before HTML5.Unfortunately there is no elegant way to handle scrollable table with fixed thead/tfoot 

because HTML/CSS specifications are not very clear about that feature.Although HTML 4.01 Specification says thead/tfoot/tbody are used (introduced?) to scroll table body: But the working scrollable table feature on FF 3.6 has been removed in FF 3.7 because considered as a bug because not compliant with HTML/CSS specifications. See this and that comments on FF bugs.Below is a simplified version of the MDN useful tips for scrollable table

see this archived page or the current French versionHowever MDN also says this does not work any more on FF :-( 

I have also tested on IE8 => table is not scrollable either :-((Not sure if anyone is still looking at this but they way I have done this previously is to use two tables to display the single original table - the first just the original table title line and no table body rows (or an empty body row to make it validate).The second is in a separate div and has no title and just the original table body rows. The separate div is then made scrollable.The second table in it's div is placed just below the first table in the HTML and it looks like a single table with a fixed header and a scrollable lower section. I have only tested this in Safari, Firefox and IE (latest versions of each in Spring 2010) but it worked in all of them.The only issue it had was that the first table would not validate without a body (W3.org validator - XHTML 1.0 strict), and when I added one with no content it causes a blank row. You can use CSS to make this not visible but it still eats up space on the page.This solution works in Chrome 35, Firefox 30 and IE 11 (not tested other versions)Its pure CSS: 

http://jsfiddle.net/ffabreti/d4sope1u/Everything is set to display:block, table needs a height:This caused me huge headaches trying to implement such a grid for an application of ours. I tried all the various techniques out there but they each had problems. The closest I came was using a jQuery plugin such as Flexigrid (look on http://www.ajaxrain.com for alternatives), but this doesn't seem to support 100% wide tables which is what I needed.What I ended up doing was rolling my own; Firefox supports scrolling tbody elements so I browser sniffed and used appropriate CSS (setting height, overflow etc... ask if you want more details) to make that scroll, and then for other browsers I used two separate tables set to use table-layout: fixed which uses a sizing algorithm that is guarenteed not to overflow the stated size (normal tables will expand when content is too wide to fit). By giving both tables identical widths I was able to get their columns to line up. I wrapped the second one in a div set to scroll and with a bit of jiggery pokery with margins etc managed to get the look and feel I wanted.Sorry if this answer sounds a bit vague in places; I'm writing quickly as I don't have much time. Leave a comment if you want me to expand any further!Here's a code that really works for IE and FF (at least):I've changed the original code to make it clearer and also to put it working fine in IE and also FF.. Original code HEREHere's my alternative. It also uses different DIVs for the header, body and footer but synchronised for window resizing and with searching, scrolling, sorting, filtering and positioning:My CD listsClick on the Jazz, Classical... buttons to see the tables. It's set up so that it's adequate even if JavaScript is turned off.Seems OK on IE, FF and WebKit (Chrome, Safari).Sorry I haven.t read all replies to your question.Yeah here the thing you want (I have done already)You can use two tables, with same class name for similar styling, one only with table head and another with your rows.

Now put this table inside a div having fixed height with overflow-y:auto OR scroll.The main problem I had with the suggestions above was being able to plug in tablesorter.js AND being able to float the headers for a table constrained to a specific max size.  I eventually stumbled across the plugin jQuery.floatThead which provided the floating headers and allowed sorting to continue to work. It also has a nice comparison page showing itself vs similar plugins.  Live JsFiddleIt is possible with only HTML & CSSIf its ok to use JavaScript here is my solution

Create a table set fixed width on all columns (pixels!) add the class Scrollify to the table and add this javascript + jquery 1.4.x set height in css or style!Tested in: Opera, Chrome, Safari, FF, IE5.5(Epic script fail), IE6, IE7, IE8, IE9Edit: Fixed height.I do this with javascript (no library) and CSS - the table body scrolls with the page, and the table does not have to be fixed width or height, although each column must have a width. You can also keep sorting functionality.Basically:Here's the javascript and a jsFiddle DEMO.For me, nothing related to scrolling really worked until I removed the width from the table CSS. Originally, the table CSS looked like this:As soon as I removed the width:100%; all scrolling features started working. If you have low enough standards ;) you could place a table that contains only a header directly above a table that has only a body. It won't scroll horizontally, but if you don't need that...

Why does overflow:hidden not work in a <td>?

I've got a table cell that I would always like to be a particular width. However, it doesn't work with large strings of unspaced text. Here's a test case:How do I get the text to be cut off at the edge of the box, rather than having the box expand?Here is the same problem.You need to set table-layout:fixed and a suitable width on the table element, as well as overflow:hidden and white-space: nowrap on the table cells.The width of the table has to be the same (or smaller) than the fixed width cell(s).With one fixed width column:With multiple fixed width columns:A width for the table must be set, but any extra width is simply taken by the fluid cell(s).With multiple columns, fixed width and fluid width:That's just the way TD's are. I believe It may be because the TD element's 'display' property is inherently set to 'table-cell' rather than 'block'.In your case, the alternative may be to wrap the contents of the TD in a DIV and apply width and overflow to the DIV.There may be some padding or cellpadding issues to deal with, and you're better off removing the inline styles and using external css instead, but this should be a start.Apply CSS table-layout:fixed; (and sometimes width:<any px or %>) to the TABLE and white-space: nowrap; overflow: hidden; style on TD. Then set CSS widths on the correct cell or column elements.Significantly, fixed-layout table column widths are determined by the cell widths in the first row of the table. If there are TH elements in the first row, and widths are applied to TD (and not TH), then the width only applies to the contents of the TD (white-space and overflow may be ignored); the table columns will distribute evenly regardless of the set TD width (because there are no widths specified [on TH in the first row]) and the columns will have [calculated] equal widths; the table will not recalculate the column width based on TD width in subsequent rows. Set the width on the first cell elements the table will encounter.Alternatively, and the safest way to set column widths is to use <COLGROUP> and <COL> tags in the table with the CSS width set on each fixed width COL. Cell width related CSS plays nicer when the table knows the column widths in advance.I'm not familiar with the specific issue, but you could stick a div, etc inside the td and set overflow on that.Well here is a solution for you but I don't really understand why it works:Namely, wrapping the cell contents in a div.Best solution is to put a div into table cell with zero width.

Tbody table cells will inherit their widths from widths defined the thead.

Position:relative and negative margin should do the trick!Here is a screenshot:

https://flic.kr/p/nvRs4jYou'll have to set the table's style attributes: width and table-layout: fixed; to let  the 'overflow: hidden;' attribute work properly.Imo this works better then using divs with the width style attribute, especially when using it for dynamic resizing calculations, the table will have a simpler DOM which makes manipulation easier because corrections for padding and margin are not required As an extra, you don't have to set the width for all cells but only for the cells in the first row.Like this:I've just had a similar problem, and had to use the <div> inside the <td> at first (John MacIntyre's solution didn't work for me for various reasons).Note though that <td><div>...</div></td> isn't valid placement for a div so instead I'm using a <span> with display:block; set. It validates fine now and works.Easiest and simplest solution that works: to make more simple

I am not using flash or php - and I have been asked to add a custom font to a simple HTML layout. "KG June Bug"I have it downloaded locally - is there a simple CSS trick to accomplish this?Yes, you can use the CSS feature named @font-face.

It has only been officially approved in CSS3, but been proposed and implemented in CSS2 and has been supported in IE for quite a long time.You declare it in the CSS like this:Then, you can just reference it like the other standard fonts:So, in this case,And you just need to put the JUNEBUG.TFF in the same location as the html file.I downloaded the font from the dafont.com website:http://www.dafont.com/junebug.fontYou can use @font-face in most modern browsers.Here's some articles on how it works:Here is a good syntax for adding the font to your app:Here are a couple of places to convert fonts for use with @font-face: Also cufon will work if you don't want to use font-face, and it has good documentation on the web site:For the best possible browser support, your CSS code should look like this :For more info, see the article Using @font-face at CSS-tricks.com.Try thisvilis.orgIf you are using an external style sheet, the code could look something like this:And should be saved in a separate .css file (eg styles.css). If your .css file is in a location separate from the page code, the actual font file should have the same path as the .css file, NOT the .html or .php web page file. Then the web page needs something like:in the <head> section of your html page. In this example, the font file should be located in the css folder along with the stylesheet. After this, simply add the class="junebug" inside any tag in your html to use Junebug font in that element.If you're putting the css in the actual web page, add the style tag in the head of the html like:And the actual element style can either be included in the above <style> and called per element by class or id, or you can just declare the style inline with the element. By element I mean <div>, <p>, <h1> or any other element within the html that needs to use the Junebug font. With both of these options, the font file (Junebug.ttf) should be located in the same path as the html page. Of these two options, the best practice would look like:andAnd the least acceptable way would be:andThe reason it's not good to use inline styles is best practice dictates that styles should be kept all in one place so editing is practical. This is also the main reason that I recommend using the very first option of using external style sheets. I hope this helps.there is a simple way to do this:

in the html file add:Note: you put the name of .ttf file you have.

then go to to your css file and add:Note: you put the font family name of the font you have.Note: do not write the font-family name as your font.ttf name

example: if your font.ttf name is: "vermin_vibes.ttf" your font-family will be: "vermin vibes" font family doesn't contain special chars as "-,_"...etc it only can contain spaces.

I've tried float: right; on the second <span> but it screws up the style, and pushes the date outside of the enclosing divIf you can modify the HTML: http://jsfiddle.net/8JwhZ/3/Working with floats is bit messy:This as many other 'trivial' layout tricks  can be done with flexbox.In 2017 I think this is preferred solution (over float) if you don't have to support legacy browsers: https://caniuse.com/#feat=flexboxCheck fiddle how different float usages compares to flexbox ("may include some competing answers"): https://jsfiddle.net/b244s19k/25/. If you still need to stick with float I recommended third version of course.An alternative solution to floats is to use absolute positioning:See also the fiddle.You can do this without modifying the html. 

http://jsfiddle.net/8JwhZ/1085/The solution using flexbox without justify-content: space-between.When we use flex:1 on the first <span>, it takes up the entire remaining space and moves the second <span> to the right.

When I create the following test code: instead of a circle, I get a oval shape.

I'm trying to play around with the code to see how I can get it to work.JSFiddleIf your content is going to wrap and be of unknown height, this is your best bet:http://cssdeck.com/labs/aplvrmueYou can use css3 flexbox.HTML:CSS:This will allow you to have vertically and horizontally middle aligned single line and multi-line text.I think you want to write text in an oval or circle? why not this one?For a web design I was recently given I had to solve the centered and unknown amount of text in a fixed circle issue and I thought I'd share the solution here for other people looking into circle/text combos.The main issue I had was text would often break the bounds of the circle. To solve this I ended up using 4 divs. 

One rectangular container that specified the max (fixed) boundaries of the circle.

Inside that would be the div that draws the circle with its width and height set to 100% so changing the size of the parent changes the size of the actual circle.

Inside that would be another rectangular div which, using %'s, would create a text boundary area preventing any text leaving the circle (for the most part)

Then finally the actual div for the text and vertical centering.It makes more sense as code:You can uncomment the border colours on the container divs to see how it constrains. Things to be aware of:

You can still break the bounds of the circle if you put too much text in or use words/unbroken text that are too long. It's still not a good fit for completely unknown text (such as user input) but works best when you know vaguely what the largest amount of text you'll need to store is and set your circle size and font sizes accordingly. You can set the text container div to hide any overflow of course, but that may just look "broken" and is no replacement for actually accounting for max size properly in your design.Hope this is useful to someone! HTML/CSS is not my main discipline so I'm sure it can be improved on!Draw a circle with text in middle with HTML Tag and without CSSIf it's only one line of text you could use the line-height property, with the same value as the element height:If the text has multiple lines, or if the content is variable, you could use the padding-top:Example: http://jsfiddle.net/2GUFL/Of course, you have to use to tags to do that.

The official discussion group has a lot of questions, but no answers.I got here looking exactly for this feature, that is, being able to save edited CSS properties back to the original file (on my local development machine). Unfortunately after searching a lot and not finding anything that suits my needs (OK, there's CSS Updater but you have to register and it's a paid extension...) I gave up on Firefox + Firebug and looked for something similar for Google Chrome. Guess what... I just found this great post that shows a nice way of getting this to work ( built into Chrome - there's no need for additional extensions ):Change CSS and SAVE on local file system using Chrome Developer ToolsI tried it now and it works great highlighting the changed lines. Just click Save and you're done! :)Here's a video explaining this and much more: Google I/O 2011: Chrome Dev Tools ReloadedI hope it helps if it doesn't matter to you changing browser while editing your CSS files. I made the change already for now, but I would really love to have this functionality built into Firebug. :)[Update 1]Today I just saw this video: Firefox CSS live edit in Sublimetext (work in progress) Looks promising indeed.[Update 2]If you happen to be using Visual Studio 2013 with Web Essentials you'll be able to sync CSS automagically as shown in this video:Web Essentials: Browser tools integrationBeen wondering the same for quite some time now,

just gut-wrenching when your in-the-moment-freestyle-css'ing with firebug gets blown to bits by

an accidental reload or whatnot....For my intents and purposes, I've finally found the tool.... : FireDiff.  It gives you a new tab, probably some weird David Bowie reference, called "changes";

which not only allows you to see/save what firebug, i. e. you, have been doing,

but also optionally track changes made by the page itself....if it and/or you are so inclined.  So thankful not having to re-type, or re-imagine and then re-re-type, every css rule I make...    Here is a link to the developer (don't be disparaged by first appearance, mayhap just as well head straight over to the Mozilla Add-On repository . The Web Developer add-on let's you save your edits.  I'd like to combine the editing of Firebug with the Save feature of Web Developer. Use the "Save" button (click CSS menu -> Edit CSS) to save the modified CSS to disk.Recomendation: Use the "Stick" button to prevent losing your changes when you change the tab for doing other browsing. If it is possible, use only one tab to do the edit and other firefox window the related searches, webmail, etc.I just released a firebug addon at the mozilla addon sandbox which might quite do what you want:

https://addons.mozilla.org/en/firefox/addon/52365/It actually saves the "touched" css files on demand to your web server (by communication with a one-file webservice php script).Documentation can be found at my homepage or on the addon pageI would appreciate any testing, bug reports, comments, ratings, discussion on this, as it's still in early beta, but should already work fine.I'm surprised that it still not listed to this question, but probably because is new and the author didn't have time to promote it yet.It is called CSS-X-Fire and it is a plugin for JetBrains series of IDEs : IntelliJ IDEA, PHPWebStorm, PyCharm, WebStorm, RubyMine.How it works: 

You install one of these IDEs and configure the deployment (supports FTP and SCP). This will allow you to stay in sync with the server.After this you install this plugin. When it starts it will ask tell you that he will install a plugin for Firefox, in order to do the integration between Firebug and the IDE. If it fails to install the plugin, just use the drag-n-drop technique to install it.Once installed it will track all your changes from Firebug and you will be able to apply them with a simple click inside de IDE. FireFile is an alternative that requires you to add one small php file to the server side in order to be able to upload the modified css.You could link firebug to eclipse with fireclipse and then save the file from eclipseI think the closest you're going to get is by going into Edit mode in Firebug and copying and pasting the contents of the CSS file.We just introduced Backfire, an open source javascript engine that allows you to save CSS changes made in Firebug and Webkit inspector to the server. The library includes an example C# implementation of how to save the incoming changes to your CSS.Here's a blog post about how it works:

http://blog.quplo.com/2010/08/backfire-save-css-changes-made-in-firebug/And here's the code hosted at Google Code:

http://code.google.com/p/backfire/I know this doesn't answer your question, but surprisingly, Internet Explorer 8's Firebug clone "developer toolbar" (accessible via F12) offers the option to "save html". This function saves the current DOM to a local file, which means that if you edit the DOM somehow, e.g. by adding a style attribute somewhere, this will be saved too.Not particularly useful if you're using Firebug to mess around with CSS like everyone does, but a step in the right direction.I propose a solution that involves a combination of Firebug and FireFTP as well as code that directly accesses the local file system when running a website locally.Here are the scenarios:Working on a website that is hosted on a remote machineIn this case you would provide the FTP details and the location of the CSS/HTML/Javascript and Firebug would then update these files when you save your changes. It may even be able to locate the files itself and then prompt you to verify that it has the correct file. If file names are unique it shouldn't be a problem.Working on a website running on your local machineIn this case you could provide Firebug with the local folder location of the website and the same behaviour would be used to match and verify the files. The access to the local file system could be performed through FireFTP if necessary.Working on a website hosted remotely without FTP accessIn this case something like the FireFile add-on would have to be implemented.An additional feature would be the ability to save and open project files that store the mappings between the local files and the URLs they are associated with as well as saving the FTP details as FireFTP already does.I am the author of CSS-X-Fire which Sorin Sbarnea also kindly posted about in this thread. Guess I'm a bit late ;)CSS-X-Fire emits CSS property changes from Firebug to the IDE where the changes can be applied or discarded.There are a couple of advantages with this solution over most of the other existing tools which only know know about the filenames and the content downloaded by the browser (see NickFitz comment in the original post).Scenario 1: You have a website (project) which has a handful of themes from which the user can select from. Each theme has its own CSS file but only one is known to Firebug, the current one. CSS-X-Fire will detect all matching selectors in the project and let you decide which should be modified.Scenario 2: The web project has stylesheets created compile-time or during deployment. They might be merged from several files and the file names may change. CSS-X-Fire doesn't care of the names of the files, it only deals with CSS selector names and their properties.Above are examples of scenarios where CSS-X-Fire excels. Since it works with the source files, and knows about the language structure, it also helps to find duplicates not known to Firebug, jump-to-code, etcetera.CSS-X-Fire is open source under the Apache 2 license.

Project home: http://code.google.com/p/css-x-fire/Firebug was created to detect a problem not to be a debugger. but you can save change if you add new tool that integrate firebug with save changes. it is FireFile, click here 

http://thelistoflist.blogspot.com/2010/04/how-to-save-change-you-make-in-firebug.html.FireFile provide the desired functionality by adding a small PHP file to the server side.Since Firebug is not working on your server but taking the CSS from the site and storing it locally and showing you the site with those local changes.Use the CSS editor in the Firefox Web Developer toolbar:http://chrispederick.com/work/web-developer/It's got enough good stuff to use in conjunction with Firebug, and it lets you save your CSS out to a text file.Use Backfire. http://blog.quplo.com/2010/08/backfire-save-css-changes-made-in-firebug/It's an open source solution that sends CSS changes back to the server and saves them. Backfire uses a single javascript file, and the sourcecode package has a working .NET server implementation example that is easily portable to other platforms.I had this problem forever as well, and finally decided that we shouldn't be editing things in the web inspector and built something for it (https://github.com/viatropos/design.io).A better solution:The main reason we're editing css in the web inspector (I use webkit, but FireBug is along the same lines) is because we need to make small adjustments, and it takes too long to reload the page.There are 2 main problems with this approach.  First, you're allowed to edit an individual element that may not have an id selector.  So even if you were able to copy/paste the generated CSS from the web inspector, it would have to generate an id to scope the css.  Something like:That would start making your css a mess.You could get around that by only changing styles for an existing selector (the .space class selector in the webkit inspector image below).Still though, the second problem.  The interface to that thing is pretty rough, it's hard to make big changes - like if you want to try real quick copying this block of css to this place, or whatever.I'd rather just stick to TextMate.The ideal would be to just write the CSS in your text editor and have the browser reflect the changes without reloading the page.  This way you'd be writing your final css as you're making the little changes.The next level would be to write in a dynamic CSS language, like Stylus, Less, SCSS, etc, and have that update the browser with the generated CSS.  This way you could start creating mixins like box-shadow(), that abstracted away the complexities, which the web inspector definitely couldn't do.There's a few things out there that kind of do this, but nothing really streamlining it in my opinion.Not having the ability to easily customize the way these work is the main reason I didn't use them.I put together https://github.com/viatropos/design.io specifically to solve this problem, and make it so:This way, when you need to make those little changes to CSS, you can say, set background color, press save, see nope, not quite, adjust the hue by 10, save, nope, adjust by 5, save, looks good.The way it works is by watching whenever you save a file (at the os level), processing the file (this is where the extensions work), and pushing the data to the browser through websockets, which are then handled (the client side of the extension).Not to plug or anything, but I struggled with this issue for a long ass time.  Hope that helps.Firebug works on the computed CSS (the one which you get by taking the CSS in the files and applying inheritance, etc. plus the changes made with JavaScript). This means that probably you couldn't use it directly to include in an HTML file, which is browser/version specific (unless you care only about Firefox). On the other hand, it keeps track of what is original and what is computed... I think it should not be very difficult to add some JS to Firebug to be able to export that CSS to a text file.I was wondering why can't I bloody well select and copy the text in front of my eyes.  Especially when others say you can just "select and copy".  Turns out you can, you just have to start the drag outside of any text (i.e. in the gutter above or to the left of the text) as any mousedown -- whether it's a click or drag -- on any text immediately invokes the property editor.  You can also click outside text to get a cursor (even if it's not always visible) which you can then move around with the arrow keys and select text that way.

  The text copied to the clipboard is devoid of any indenting, unfortunately, but at least it saves you from manually transcribing the entire contents of the CSS file.  Just have your diff programme ignore changes in whitespace when comparing against the original.You could write your own server script file that takes a filename parameter and a content parameter.The server script would find the requested file and replace its contents with the new one.Writing the Javascript that taps into firebug's info and retrieves the useful data would be the tricky part.I'd personally rather ask the dev team at firebug to supply a function, it shouldn't be too hard for them.Finally, Ajax sends the filename/content pair to the php file you created.Quoted from the Firebug FAQ:Here's a partial solution. After you make your changes, click on one of the links to the relevant file. This is the original file, so you'll have to refresh the file, which is under the options menu button in the upper right of the firebug pane. Now you have the modified css page, which you can copy & paste. Obviously, you'll have to do it for each css file.Edit: looks like Mark Biek has a quicker versionA very easy way to "edit" your page is to go onto the site via your internet browser. Save the page as html only onto your desktop. Go to your desktop and right click on the new web page file and select open with, choose notepad and edit the page from there, if you know html it will be easy. After all your editing is done, save the file and reopen your webpage, the changes should be there if done correctly. You can then use your new edited page and export or copy it to your remote locationActually Firebug is a debug and analyze-Tool: not an editor and obviously not considered to be one.

For example:<td style="width:100px;">some data</td>This is another way of tackling the problem if you have long strings (like file path names) and you only want to break the strings on certain characters (like slashes). You can insert Unicode Zero Width Space characters just before (or after) the slashes in the HTML.I have tested with the binary data and its working perfectly here.Just add:   word-break: break-word;     to you table class.

A script element that got styled as display:block appears visible. Why is it possible and is there any real use case where it is desired?

2016-07-01 10:53:19Z

A script element that got styled as display:block appears visible. Why is it possible and is there any real use case where it is desired?The HTML5 specification defines a style sheet that user agents (like browsers) are expected to use. Section 10.3.1 lists the styles for "Hidden elements":As you can see, it applies display: none; to script.This is the only "barrier" between your users and hidden script elements. It’s perfectly fine and intended to be able to overwrite styles from user-agent style sheets within author style sheets (and of course also within user style sheets).Why someone might want to use it?  One use case is displaying content without having to escape characters like </>, similar to the old xmp element. The script element can be used not only for scripts, but also for data blocks (i.e., for anything with a MIME type).Because they are HTML elements like any other and there is no reason to write special case rules in the HTML specification (which would add complexity) to prevent CSS from applying to them.Any element can be styled. Take, for example:Certainly no common ones, but general rules aren't designed to make sense for everything that you can apply them to. They are designed for the common cases.Another (not common) use case:I sometimes use <script> tags for brief HTML code examples in style guides. That way I don't have to escape HTML tags and special characters. And text editor tag autocomplete and syntax highlighting still work. But there's no easy way to add syntax highlighting in the browser.Possible use case: for debugging purposes.You could apply a class at the document level, eg. <body class="debugscript">, then use some CSS:Script tags are hidden by default by using display:none;. Unor1 explains the underlying language specification. However, they are still part of the DOM and can be styled accordingly.That said, it is important to keep in mind exactly what a script tag is doing. While it used to be accompanied by types and languages, that is no longer required. It is now assumed that JavaScript is in there, and as a result browsers will interpret and execute the script as it is encountered (or loaded) from these tags. Once the script has been executed, the content of the tag is only text (often hidden) on the page. This text can be revealed, but it can also be removed because it is just text. At the bottom of your page, right before the closing </html> tag, you could very easily remove these tags along with their text and there would be no changes to the page.For example:This will not remove any functionality, as the state of the page has already been altered and is reflected in the current global execution context. For example, if the page had loaded a library such as jQuery, removing the tags will not mean that jQuery is no longer exposed because it has already been added to the page's runtime environment. It is essentially only making the DOM inspection tool not show script elements, but it does highlight that the script elements once executed really are only text.1. unor, Thu Jul 07 2016, wutzebaer, "When should  tags be visible and why can they?", Jul 1 at 10:53, https://stackoverflow.com/a/38147398/1026459

See example comparison of current stable Chrome 35 and latest Chrome 37 (early development preview) here:1.) There is NO proper solution when loading fonts via @import, <link href= or Google's webfont.js. The problem is that Chrome simply requests .woff files from Google's API which render horribly. Surprisingly all other font file types render beautifully. However, there are some CSS tricks that will "smoothen" the rendered font a little bit, you'll find the workaround(s) deeper in this answer.2.) There IS a real solution for this when self-hosting the fonts, first posted by Jaime Fernandez in another answer on this Stackoverflow page, which fixes this issue by loading web fonts in a special order.

There is also an (unproven) solution that recommends using only TTF/OTF fonts as they are now supported by nearly all browsers.3.) The Google Chrome developer team works on that issue.

Currently, in May 2013, even 11 months after the bug was reported, it's not solved. It's a strange thing that the only browser that messes up Google Webfonts is Google's own browser Chrome (!). But there's a simple workaround that will fix the problem, please see below for the solution.STATEMENT FROM GOOGLE CHROME DEVELOPMENT TEAM, MAY 2013Official statement in the bug report comments:Our Windows font rendering is actively being worked on. ... We hope to have something within a milestone or two that developers can start playing with. How fast it goes to stable is, as always, all about how fast we can root out and burn down any regressions.I had the same problem, and I found the solution in this post of Sam Goddard, The solution if to defined the call to the font twice. First as it is recommended, to be used for all the browsers, and after a particular call only for Chrome with a special media query:With this method the font will render good in all browsers. The only negative point that I found is that the font file is also downloaded twice.You can find an spanish version of this article in my pageChrome doesn't render the fonts like Firefox or any other browser does. This is generally a problem in Chrome running on Windows only. If you want to make the fonts smooth, use the -webkit-font-smoothing property on yer h4 tags like this.You can also use subpixel-antialiased, this will give you different type of smoothing (making the text a little blurry/shadowed). However, you will need a nightly version to see the effects. You can learn more about font smoothing here.Ok you can use this simplyMake sure your text color and upper text-stroke-width must me same and that's it.I will say before all that this will not always works, i have tested this with sans-serif font and external fonts like open sansSometimes, when you use huge fonts, try to approximate to font-size:49px and upperThis is a header text with a size of 48px (font-size:48px; in the element that contains the text).But, if you up the 48px to font-size:49px; (and 50px, 60px, 80px, etc...), something interesting happensThe text automatically get smooth, and seems really goodIf you are looking for small fonts, you can try this, but isn't very effective.To the parent of the text, just apply the next css property: -webkit-backface-visibility: hidden;You can transform something like this:To this:(the font is Kreon)Consider that when you are not putting that property, -webkit-backface-visibility: visible; is inheritBut be careful, that practice will not give always good results, if you see carefully, Chrome just make the text look a little bit blurry.-webkit-backface-visibility: hidden; will works too when you transform a text in Chrome (with the -webkit-transform property, that includes rotations, skews, etc)Without -webkit-backface-visibility: hidden;With -webkit-backface-visibility: hidden;Well, I don't know why that practices works, but it does for me.

I'm building an HTML UI with some text elements, such as tab names, which look bad when selected. Unfortunately, it's very easy for a user to double-click a tab name, which selects it by default in many browsers.I might be able to solve this with a JavaScript trick (I'd like to see those answers, too) -- but I'm really hoping there's something in CSS/HTML directly that works across all browsers.In most browsers, this can be achieved using CSS:For IE < 10 and Opera, you will need to use the unselectable attribute of the element you wish to be unselectable. You can set this using an attribute in HTML:Sadly this property isn't inherited, meaning you have to put an attribute in the start tag of every element inside the <div>. If this is a problem, you could instead use JavaScript to do this recursively for an element's descendants:EDITCode apparently comes from http://www.dynamicdrive.comAll of the correct CSS variations are:Try this:Simple, but effective... works in current versions of all major browsers.For Firefox you can apply the CSS declaration "-moz-user-select" to "none".

Check out their documentation, user-select.It's a "preview" of the future "user-select" as they say, so maybe Opera or WebKit-based browsers will support that. I also recall finding something for Internet Explorer, but I don't remember what :).Anyway, unless it's a specific situation where text-selecting makes some dynamic functionality fail, you shouldn't really override what users are expecting from a webpage, and that is being able to select any text they want.I'm finding some level of success with the CSS described here http://www.quirksmode.org/css/selection.html:It took care of most of the issues I was having with some ThemeRoller ul elements in an AIR application (WebKit engine). Still getting a small (approx. 15 x 15) patch of nothingness that gets selected, but half the page was being selected before.Absolutely position divs over the text area with a z-index higher and give these divs a transparent GIF background graphic.Note after a bit more thought - You'd need to have these 'covers' be linked so clicking on them would take you to where the tab was supposed to, which means you could/should do this with the anchor element set to display:box, width and height set as well as the transparent background image.For an example of why it might be desirable to suppress selection, see SIMILE TImeline, which uses drag-and-drop to explore  the timeline, during which accidental vertical mouse movement causes the labels to be highlighted unexpectedly, which looks weird.For Safari, -khtml-user-select: none, just like Mozilla's -moz-user-select (or, in JavaScript, target.style.KhtmlUserSelect="none";).That's true, but most copying, in my experience, has nothing to do with "ultimately" or geeks or determined plagiarists or anything like that. It's usually casual copying by clueless people, and even a simple, easily defeated protection (easily defeated by folks like us, that is) works quite well to stop them. They don't know anything about "view source" or caches or anything else... heck, they don't even know what a web browser is or that they're using one.Here's a Sass mixin (scss) for those interested. Compass/CSS 3 doesn't seem to have a user-select mixin.Though Compass would do it in a more robust way, i.e. only add support for vendors you've chosen.If it looks bad you can use CSS to change the appearance of selected sections.Any JavaScript or CSS method is easily circumvented with Firebug (like Flickr's case).You can use the ::selection pseudo-element in CSS to alter the highlight color.If the tabs are links and the dotted rectangle in active state is of concern, you can remove that too (consider usability of course).There are many occasions when turning off selectability enhances the user experience.For instance allowing the user to copy a block of text on the page without copying the text of any interface elements associated with it (that would become interspersed within the text being copied).Images can be selected too.There are limits to using JavaScript to deselect text, as it might happen even in places where you want to select. To ensure a rich and successful career, steer clear of all requirements that need ability to influence or manage the browser beyond the ordinary... unless, of course, they are paying you extremely well.The following works in Firefox interestingly enough if I remove the write line it doesn't work.

Anyone have any insight why the write line is needed.

ThanksYou can set the draggable attribute to false in either the markup or JavaScript code.I think you can change yourinto a Try it:and try to avoidYou can use a CSS property to disable images in webkit browsers.This will disable dragging for an image in all browsers, while preserving other events such as click and hover. Works as long as any of HTML5, JS, or CSS are available.<img draggable="false" onmousedown="return false" style="user-drag: none" />If you're confident the user will have JS, you only need to use the JS attribute, etc. For more flexibility, look into ondragstart, onselectstart, and some WebKit tap/touch CSS.Handle the dragstart event and return false.You can assign an alternate ghost image if you really need to use drag events and can't set draggable=false. So just assign a blank png like so: Place the image as a background of an empty div, or under a transparent element. When the user clicks on the image to drag, they are clicking on a div.See http://www.flickr.com/photos/thefella/5878724253/?f=hpFor Firefox you need to go a little deeper with this:Enjoy.I found that for IE, you must add the draggable="false" attribute to images and anchors to prevent dragging. the CSS options work for all other browsers.  I did this in jQuery:There is a much easier solution here than adding empty event listeners. 

Just set pointer-events: noneto your image. If you still need it to be clickable, add a container around it which triggers the event.Tested on Firefox: removing and putting back the image works! And it's transparent at the execution, too. For instance,EDIT: This works only on IE and on Firefox, strangely. I also added draggable = false on each image. Still a ghost with Chrome and Safari.EDIT 2: The background-image solution is genuinely the best one. The only subtlety is that the background-size property has to be redefined every time the background-image is changed! Or so, that's what it looked like from my side. Better still, I had an issue with normal img tags under IE, where IE failed to resize the images. Now, the images have the correct dimensions. Simple:Also, perhaps consider those:You can set the image that is shown when an item is dragged. Tested with Chrome.setDragImageuse  Alternatively, as already mentioned in the answers, you can set draggable="false" on the HTML element, if not being able to drag the element at all is no issue.

You can now add the gradient background image to it or style it using CSS3 gradients. Read more on HTML5 forms structure hereCheers!

.PavFor reliability I'd suggest giving class-names, or ids to the elements to style (ideally a class for the text-inputs, since there will presumably be several) and an id to the submit button (though a class would work as well):With the CSS:For more up-to-date browsers, you can select by attributes (using the same HTML):You could also just use sibling combinators (since the text-inputs to style seem to always follow a label element, and the submit follows a textarea (but this is rather fragile)):form element UI is somewhat controlled by browser and operating system, so it is not trivial to style them very reliably in a way that it would look the same in all common browser/OS combinations.Instead, if you want something specific, I would recommend to use a library that provides you stylable form elements. uniform.js is one such library.When styling a input type submit use the following code.Actually, this too works great.I did it this way based on the answers given here, I hope it helpsHTMLCSS stylingVery simple: This is working I have tested.

CSS: Animation vs. Transition

[CSS: Animation vs. Transition](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/20586143/css-animation-vs-transition)

So, I understand how to perform both CSS3 transitions and animations. What is not clear, and I've googled, is when to use which. For example, if I want to make a ball bounce, it is clear that animation is the way to go. I could provide keyframes and the browser would do the intermediates frames and I'll have a nice animation going.However, there are cases when a said effect can be achieved either way.

It looks like you've got a handle on how to do them, just not when to do them.A transition is an animation, just one that is performed between two distinct states - i.e. a start state and an end state. Like a drawer menu, the start state could be open and the end state could be closed, or vice versa.If you want to perform something that does not specifically involve a start state and an end state, or you need more fine grain control over the keyframes in a transition, then you've got to use an animation.I'll let the definitions speak for themselves (according to Merriam-Webster):The names appropriately fit their purposes in CSSSo, the example you gave should use transitions because it is only a change from one state to anotherA shorter answer, straight on point:Transition:Animation @keyframes:Both use CPU acceleration for a much smoother effect.Animations are just that - a smooth behavior of set of properties. In other words it specifies what should happen to a set of element's properties. You define an animation and describe how this set of properties should behave during the animation process.Transitions on the other side specify how a property (or properties) should perform their change. Each change. Setting a new value for certain property, be it with JavaScript or CSS, is always a transition, but by default it is not smooth. By setting transition in the css style you define different (smooth) way to perform these changes.It can be said that transitions define a default animation that should be performed every time the specified property has changed.In modern browsers, h/w acceleration occurs for the properties filter, opacity and transform. This is for both CSS Animations and CSS Transitions.I believe CSS3 animation vs CSS3 transition will give you the answer you want.Basically below are some takeaways :

Then how can I set coordinates of an element but relative to the parent?I found that .position() method get only "top,left" values relative to the parent, but it doesn't set any values.I tried with but does not work.To set the position relative to the parent you need to set the position:relative of parent and position:absolute of the element This works because position: absolute; positions relatively to the closest positioned parent (i.e., the closest parent with any position property other than the default static).You could try jQuery UI's .position method.Check the working demo.Code offset dynamic for dynamic pageI found that if the value passed is a string type, it must be followed by 'px' (i.e. 90px), where if the value is an integer, it will append the px automatically.  the width and height properties are more forgiving (either type works).Refreshing my memory on setting position, I'm coming to this so late I don't know if anyone else will see it, but --I don't like setting position using css(), though often it's fine. I think the best bet is to use jQuery UI's position() setter as noted by xdazz. However if jQuery UI is, for some reason, not an option (yet jQuery is), I prefer this:This has the advantage of not arbitrarily setting $div's parent to relative positioning (what if $div's parent was, itself, absolute positioned inside something else?). I think the only major edge case is if $div doesn't have any offsetParent, not sure if it would return document, null, or something else entirely.offsetParent has been available since jQuery 1.2.6, sometime in 2008, so this technique works now and when the original question was asked.Use offset() function of jQuery.

How do I change the background color with JavaScript?

Anyone know a simple method to swap the background color of a webpage using JavaScript?

2008-10-13 14:23:39Z

Anyone know a simple method to swap the background color of a webpage using JavaScript?Modify the JavaScript property document.body.style.background.For example:Note: this does depend a bit on how your page is put together, for example if you're using a DIV container with a different background colour you will need to modify the background colour of that instead of the document body.You don't need AJAX for this, just some plain java script setting the background-color property of the body element, like this:If you want to do it as if it was initiated by the server, you would have to poll the server and then change the color accordingly.I agree with the previous poster that changing the color by className is a prettier approach. My argument however is that a className can be regarded as a definition of "why you want the background to be this or that color." For instance, making it red is not just because you want it red, but because you'd want to inform users of an error. As such, setting the className AnErrorHasOccured on the body would be my preferred implementation.In cssIn JavaScript:This leaves you the options of styling more elements according to this className. And as such, by setting a className you kind of give the page a certain state.AJAX is getting data from the server using Javascript and XML in an asynchronous fashion. Unless you want to download the colour code from the server, that's not what you're really aiming for!But otherwise you can set the CSS background with Javascript. If you're using a framework like jQuery, it'll be something like this:Otherwise, this should work:You can do it in following ways

STEP 1 For changing background of BODYTo change an element with IDfor elements with same classI wouldn't really class this as "AJAX". Anyway, something like following should do the trick: Css approach:If you want to see continuous colour, use this code:If you want to see it faster or slower, change 10 second to 5 second etc.You can change background of a page by simply using:However the below script will change the background of the page after every 3 seconds using setTimeout() function:READ MOREDEMOI would prefer to see the use of a css class here. It avoids having hard to read colors / hex codes in javascript.This will change the background color according to the choice of user selected from the drop-down menu:Add this script element to your body element, changing the color as desired:But you would want to configure the body color before the <body> element exists. That way it has the right color from the get go.This you can put in the <head> of the document or in your js file.Here is a nice color to play with.I would suggest the following code:if you wish to use a button or some other event, just use this in JS:You can change background of a page by simply using:Read more @ Changing the Background ColorAlternatively, if you wish to specify the background color value in rgb notation then trywhere a,b,c are the color valuesExample:This is simple coding for changing background using javascript

How to markup form fields with <div class='field_type'> in Djangooror--- EDIT ---

The above is the easiest change to make to original question's code that accomplishes what was asked. It also keeps you from repeating yourself if you reuse the form in other places; your classes or other attributes just work if you use the Django's as_table/as_ul/as_p form methods.  If you need full control for a completely custom rendering, this is clearly documented-- EDIT 2 ---

Added a newer way to specify widget and attrs for a ModelForm.This can be done using a custom template filter. Consider rendering your form this way:form.subject is an instance of BoundField which has the as_widget() method.You can create a custom filter addclass in my_app/templatetags/myfilters.py:And then apply your filter:form.subjects will then be rendered with the MyClass CSS class.If you don't want to add any code to the form (as mentioned in the comments to @shadfc's Answer), it is certainly possible, here are two options.First, you just reference the fields individually in the HTML, rather than the entire form at once:(Note that I also changed it to a unsorted list.) Second, note in the docs on outputting forms as HTML, Django:All of your form fields already have a unique id. So you would reference id_subject in your CSS file to style the subject field. I should note, this is how the form behaves when you take the default HTML, which requires just printing the form, not the individual fields:See the previous link for other options when outputting forms (you can do tables, etc).Note - I realize this isn't the same as adding a class to each element (if you added a field to the Form, you'd need to update the CSS also) - but it's easy enough to reference all of the fields by id in your CSS like this:Per this blog post, you can add css classes to your fields using a custom template filter.You can do like this:Hope that works.IgnasYou could use this library: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/django-widget-tweaksIt allows you to do the following:You can do:Then you can add classes/id's to for example the <td> tag. You can of course use any others tags you want. Check Working with Django forms as an example what is available for each field in the form ({{field}} for example is just outputting the input tag, not the label and so on).One solution is to use JavaScript to add the required CSS classes after the page is ready. For example, styling django form output with bootstrap classes (jQuery used for brevity):This avoids the ugliness of mixing styling specifics with your business logic.You may not need to override your form class' __init__, because Django sets name & id attributes in the HTML inputs. You can have CSS like this:Didn't see this one really...https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.8/ref/forms/api/#more-granular-outputThe as_p(), as_ul() and as_table() methods are simply shortcuts for lazy developers – they’re not the only way a form object can be displayed.class BoundField

Used to display HTML or access attributes for a single field of a Form instance.The str() (unicode on Python 2) method of this object displays the HTML for this field.To retrieve a single BoundField, use dictionary lookup syntax on your form using the field’s name as the key:To retrieve all BoundField objects, iterate the form:The field-specific output honors the form object’s auto_id setting:There is a very easy to install and great tool made for Django that I use for styling and it can be used for every frontend framework like Bootstrap, Materialize, Foundation, etc. It is called widget-tweaks Documentation: Widget Tweaksfrom django import formsInstead of using default:You can edit it your own way using the render_field attribute that gives you a more html-like way of styling it like this example:template.htmlThis library gives you the opportunity to have well separated yout front end from your backendWrite your form like:In your HTML field do something like:Then in your CSS write something like:Hope this answer is worth a try! Note you must have written your views to render the HTML file that contains the form.In Django 1.10 (possibly earlier as well) you can do it as follows.Model:Form:Template:Edit: Another (slightly better) way of doing what I'm suggesting is answered here: Django form input field stylingAll the above options are awesome, just thought I'd throw in this one because it's different.If you want custom styling, classes, etc. on your forms, you can make an html input in your template that matches your form field. For a CharField, for example, (default widget is TextInput), let's say you want a bootstrap-looking text input. You would do something like this: <input type="text" class="form-control" name="form_field_name_here"> And as long as you put the form field name matches the html name attribue, (and the widget probably needs to match the input type as well) Django will run all the same validators on that field when you run validate or form.is_valid() and Styling other things like labels, error messages, and help text don't require much workaround because you can do something like form.field.error.as_text and style them however you want. The actual fields are the ones that require some fiddling.I don't know if this is the best way, or the way I would recommend, but it is a way, and it might be right for someone.Here's a useful walkthrough of styling forms and it includes most of the answers listed on SO (like using the attr on the widgets and widget tweaks).

https://simpleisbetterthancomplex.com/article/2017/08/19/how-to-render-django-form-manually.htmlStyling widget instancesIf you want to make one widget instance look different from another, you will need to specify additional attributes at the time when the widget object is instantiated and assigned to a form field (and perhaps add some rules to your CSS files).https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.2/ref/forms/widgets/To do this, you use the Widget.attrs argument when creating the widget:You can also modify a widget in the form definition:Or if the field isn’t declared directly on the form (such as model form fields), you can use the Form.fields attribute:Django will then include the extra attributes in the rendered output:

But if it is overflowed I want to show a 'more' button, but if not I don't want to show that button.Is there an easy way to detect overflow, or is there a better method?If you want to show only an identifier for more content, then you can do this with pure CSS. I use pure scrolling shadows for this. The trick is the use of background-attachment: local;. Your css looks like this:The code and the example you can find on http://dabblet.com/gist/2462915And an explanation you can find here: http://lea.verou.me/2012/04/background-attachment-local/.The element may be overflown vertically, horizontally or both. This function will return you a boolean value if the DOM element is overflown:ES6 example:Comparing element.scrollHeight to element.clientHeight should do the task.Below are the images from MDN explaining Element.scrollHeight and Element.clientHeight.I made a multipart codepen demonstrating the above answers ( e.g. using overflow hidden and height) but also how you would expand / collapse overflowed itemsExample 1: https://codepen.io/Kagerjay/pen/rraKLB ( Real simple example, no javascript, just to clip overflowed items)Example 2: https://codepen.io/Kagerjay/pen/LBErJL (Single event handler show more / showless on overflowed items)Example 3: https://codepen.io/Kagerjay/pen/MBYBoJ (Multi event handler on many show more/ show less on overflowed items)I have attached example 3 below as well, I use Jade/Pug so it might be a tad verbose. I suggest checking out the codepens I've made its simpler to grasp.Would something like this: http://jsfiddle.net/Skooljester/jWRRA/1/ work? It just checks the height of the content and compares it to the height of the container. If it's greater than you can put in the code to append a "Show more" button.Update: Added the code to create a "Show More" button at the top of the container.If you are using jQuery, you might try a trick: make outer div with overflow: hiddenand inner div with content. Then use .height() function to check if height of the inner div is greater than the height of the outer div. I'm not sure it will work but give it a try.use js to check if the child's offsetHeight is more than the parents.. if it is,make the parents overflow scroll/hidden/auto whichever you want and also display:block on the more div.. Another issue you should consider is a JS unavailability. Think about progressive enchantment or graceful degradation. I would suggest:Here is a fiddle for determining whether an element has been overflowed using a wrapper div with overflow:hidden and JQuery height() to measure the difference between the wrapper and an inner content div.Source: Frameworks & Extensions on jsfiddle.netThis is the jQuery solution that worked for me. clientWidth etc. didn't work.If this doesn't work, ensure that elements' parent has the desired width (personally, I had to use parent().parent()). position is relative to the parent. I've also included extra_width because my elements ("tags") contain images which take small time to load, but during the function call they have zero width, spoiling the calculation. To get around that, I use the following calling code:Hope this helps.You can check the bounds relative to the offset parent.If you pass this an element it will tell you whether its bounds are entirely inside a container, and will default to the element's offset parent if no explicit container is provided.

Hi I'm using something similiar to the following to get a div positioned in the middle of the screen:However the problem with this is it positions the item in the middle of the page not the screen. So if the page is a few screen high and I'm at the top of the page (the top part of the part is displayed on the screen) when I make the div appear it's not even on the screen.

 This worked for meShort answer, Just add position:fixed and that will solve your problemWell, below is the working example for this.This will handle the center position if you resize the webpage or load in anysize.In above sample loading div will always be in center.Hoping this will help you :)Two ways to position a tag in the middle of screen or its parent tag:Set the parent tag position to relative (if the target tag has a parent tag) and then set the target tag style like this:The parent tag style should looks like this:Try this one.In ur script page...Use a-middle class in the Div...USING FLEX For this you would have to detect screen size. That is not possible with CSS or HTML; you need JavaScript.

How do I get the "x" to be vertically-aligned in the middle of the span?

How do I get the "x" to be vertically-aligned in the middle of the span?Use line-height:50px; instead of height. That should do the trick ;)Be aware that the line-height approach fails if you have a long sentence in the span which breaks the line because there's not enough space. In this case, you would have two lines with a gap with the height of the N pixels specified in the property.I stuck into it when I wanted to show an image with vertically centered text on its right side which works in a responsive web application. As a base I use the approach suggested by Eric Nickus and Felipe Tadeo. If you want to achieve:and this:This is the simplest way to do it if you need multiple lines. Wrap you span'd text in another span and specify its height with line-height. The trick to multiple lines is resetting the inner span's line-height.DEMOOf course the outer span could be a div or whathaveyouThe flexbox way:I needed this for links, so I wrapped the span with an a-tag and a div, then centered the span tag itselfHTMLCSSCSS vertical center image and textI have Create one demo for vertical image center and text also i have test on firefox ,chrome,safari, internet explorer 9 and 8 too.It is very short and easy css and html, Please check below code and you can find output on screenshort.HTMLCSSOutput

Would you please explain me the difference between these two CSS classes syntax:andI don't understand the difference between the two. The first line indicates two different classes to which are applied the same styles. But about the second, what's the meaning of '.large' which is written attached to '.element'?I think you got a slight misunderstanding what the first one means.Means that those CSS settings are applied to any HTML element with the class .symbol that is inside an element with the class .element.In this example your first CSS entry would affect the <div> tag in the middle.Your second example means that the first class requires two classes to be affected. Other than that it's equal to the first one.So if the HTML looks like this, the CSS values will be applied to the inner <div> tag as well.If you want to set CSS tags that apply for multiple classes separately then you need to split them up using a comma. So it looks like this: Edit: By request the link to the documentation of the CSS selectors.means .symbol inside .elementmeans .element that has the class symbol as well.So,means .symbol inside .element that has the class large as well.Usingrefers to an element with both classes:rather than a descendant of an element:meaning that in:onlyis 'receiving' the styles.Basically, being separated by a space implies two elements with a descendant relationship.You would use .element .symbol this where you have an element inside of another element. For example:If down the road you wanted to differentiate some divs, you could add an additional class to target only those that differ, and target it with .element.large .symbol. So, for example:In your second example, the first part of the selector is simply an element with two classes, as in <span class="element large"> or <span class="large element">.In general, each part of a selector applies to one HTML element.table[border].clname means a table with a border attribute and a class of clname, while table [border] .clname means an element with class clname, in an element with a border attribute, in a table.(Edit: well, I say "one HTML element", but of course you can have more than one table that this applies to.

As you move the window bar, you'll see iframe to responsively resize Alternatively, you may also use the intrinsic ratio technique

However, I wanted to make the scroll available so I came up with this: // HTML// CSSYou can use this tricks mentioned on this site http://css-tricks.com/NetMag/FluidWidthVideo/Article-FluidWidthVideo.php.Its very useful and easy to understand. All you need to createHere is your edited js fiddle for demonstration. check out this solution... works for me >> https://jsfiddle.net/y49jpdns/DA is right. In your own fiddle, the iframe is indeed responsive. You can verify that in firebug by checking iframe box-sizing. But some elements inside that iframe is not responsive, so they "stick out" when window size is small. For example, div#products-post-wrapper's width is 8800px.iFrames CAN be FULLY responsive while keeping their aspect ratio with a little CSS technique called the Intrinsic Ratio Technique. I wrote a blog post addressing this question specifically: https://benmarshall.me/responsive-iframes/This gist is:BOOM, fully responsive!I noticed that leowebdev's post did seem to work on my end, however, it did knock out two elements of the site that I am trying to make:  the scrolling and the footer.The scrolling I got back by adding a

On mobile you don't see the scrollbar, you just scroll until you see the content (of the iframe). Of course you give it at least some kind of height, to make the content height adapt to the vertical space occurring on a narrower screen - with media queries, like, for example:it solved me by adjusting code from @Connor Cushion Mulhall byDue to browser security constraints, you will have to include the Javascript file both in the「parent」page, as well as in the page being embedded through an iframe (「child」).In the current version, the parent page must include the latest version of jQuery.

https://jsfiddle.net/96knodm6/If you want to apply ellipsis (...) to a single line of text, CSS makes that somewhat easy with the text-overflow property. It's still a bit tricky (due to all the requirements – see below), but text-overflow makes it possible and reliable.If, however, you want to use ellipsis on multiline text – as would be the case here – then don't expect to have any fun. CSS has no standard method for doing this, and the workarounds are hit and miss.With text-overflow, ellipsis can be applied to a single line of text. The following CSS requirements must be met:So this will work:jsFiddle versionBUT, try removing the width, or letting the overflow default to visible, or removing white-space: nowrap, or using something other than a block container element, AND, ellipsis fails miserably.One big takeaway here: text-overflow: ellipsis has no effect on multiline text. (The white-space: nowrap requirement alone eliminates that possibility.)jsFiddle versionBecause CSS has no property for ellipsis on multiline text, various workarounds have been created. Several of these methods can be found here:The Mobify link above was removed and now references an archive.org copy, but appears to be implemented in this codepen.Just increase the -webkit-line-clamp: 4;  to increase the number of linesLine clamp is a proprietary and undocumented CSS (webkit) : https://caniuse.com/#feat=css-line-clamp, so it currently work on only few browsers.Please check this css for ellipsis to multi-line text I finally found a solution to do what I want. 

As p a paragraphe and article the wrapper. 

If you want to apply ellipsis to p depending on article height (which also depends on window height), you need to get the height of the article, the line-height of the p and then articleHeight/lineHeight to find the number of line-clamp that can be added dynamically then. The only thing is the line-height should be declared in the css file.Check the following code. If you change the height of the window, the line-clamp will change. Can be great to create a plug-in aiming to do that.jsfiddleThis man have the best solution. Only css:I took a look at how YouTube solves it on their homepage and simplified it:This will allow 2 lines of code and then append an ellipsis.Gist: https://gist.github.com/eddybrando/386d3350c0b794ea87a2082bf4ab014bI have just been playing around a little bit with this concept. Basically, if you are ok with potentially having a pixel or so cut off from your last character, here is a pure css and html solution:The way this works is by absolutely positioning a div below the viewable region of a viewport. We want the div to offset up into the visible region as our content grows. If the content grows too much, our div will offset too high, so upper bound the height our content can grow.HTML:CSS:I have tested this in Chrome, FF, Safari, and IE 11. You can check it out here: http://codepen.io/puopg/pen/vKWJwKYou might even be able to alleviate the abrupt cut off of the character with some CSS magic. EDIT: I guess one thing that this imposes is word-break: break-all since otherwise the content would not extend to the very end of the viewport. :(Unfortunately no with current state of affairs in CSS. Ellipsis rendering has prerequisite white-space:nowrap that effectively means: ellipsis are drawn on single line text containers only. user this formula:I came up with my own solution for this:May be this can help you guys. Multi Line Ellipses with tooltip hover.

You could try and use a simple Javascript ellipsis library like Ellipsity on github the source code is very clean and small so if you do need to make any additional changes it should be quite easy. https://github.com/Xela101/EllipsityWell you could use the line-clamp function in CSS3.Make sure you change the settings like you're own.After looking all over the internet and trying a lot of these options, the only way to make sure that it is covered correctly with support for i.e is through javascript, i created a loop function to go over post items that require multi line truncation. *note i used Jquery, and requires your post__items class to have a fixed max-height. or we can restrict the lines by using and height and overflow.If you are using javascript, maybe you can do something like below.

However, this does not account the height of the container...Try this Simple way. I have also jsfiddle link here.Here is -webkit-line-clamp has an important role. The value of this property decides how much lines are visible.CSS PARTHTML PARTMy solution that works for me for multiline ellipsis:Pros:

+ Cross browser (IE11, Edge, Chrome, Firefox, Safari, etc.)

+ Most natural lookingCons:

- Adds lots of extra elements to the DOMI wasn't satisfied with any of the workarounds I had seen. Most of them use line-clamp which is currently only supported in webkit. So I played around with it until I came up with a solution. This pure javascript solution should be compatible with IE10 and greater and all modern browsers. This is untested outside of the stackoverflow example space below.I think this is a good solution. The one big caveat is that it creates a span for each word inside the container, which will impact layout performance, so your mileage may vary.If you also have multiple elements and you want a link with read more button after ellipsis, take a look on https://stackoverflow.com/a/51418807/10104342If you want something like this:

How can I set line spacing with CSS, like we can set it in MS Word?

2010-10-02 11:22:36Z

How can I set line spacing with CSS, like we can set it in MS Word?Try the line-height property.For example, 12px font-size and 4px distant from the bottom and upper lines:Or with em unitsYou can also use a unit-less value, which is the number of lines: line-height: 2; is double spaced, line-height: 1.5; is one and a half, etc. You cannot set inter-paragraph spacing in CSS using line-height, the spacing between <p> blocks.  That instead sets the intra-paragraph line spacing, the space between lines within a <p> block.  That is, line-height is the typographer's inter-line leading within the paragraph is controlled by line-height.  I presently do not know of any method in CSS to produce (for example) a 0.15em inter-<p> spacing, whether using em or rem variants on any font property.  I suspect it can be done with more complex floats or offsets.  A pity this is necessary in CSS.If you want condensed lines, you can set same value for font-size and line-heightIn your CSS fileIn your HTML file--> Play with this snippet on jsfiddle.netYou can also increase line-height for fine line spacing control:Try this propertyoruse the increase & decrease  the volumeI am not sure if this is what you meant:Try line-height property; there are many ways to assign line heightYup, as everyone's saying, line-height is the thing.

Any font you are using, a mid-height character (such as a or ■, not going through the upper or lower) should go with the same height-length at line-height: 0.6 to 0.65.lineSpacing is used in React Native (or native mobile apps).For web you can use letterSpacing (or letter-spacing)

One way would be to just remove CSS class from the div using jQuery but that would break other things since I also using that class to format its child elements.

This isn't directly what you asked but without more context it feels like the best solution and is possibly the cleanest and simplest way of doing it.Example:One method to do this is to add:to the element you want to disable hover on.(note: this also disables javascript events on that element too, click events will actually fall through to the element behind ).

There's not currently a work-around that I'm aware of.It is also documented on Eric Meyer's article: Un-fixing Fixed Elements with CSS Transforms.I had a flickering on my fixed top nav when items in the page were using transform, the following applied to my top nav resolved the jumping/flickering issue:Thanks to this answer on SOAs Bradoergo suggested, just get the window scrollTop and add it to the absolute position top like:This worked for me anyway.In Firefox and Safari you can use position: sticky; instead of position: fixed; but it will not work in other browsers. For that you need javascript.In my opinion, the best method to deal with this is to apply the same translate, but break children that need to be fixed out of their parent (translated) element; and then apply the translate to a div inside the position: fixed wrapper.The results look something like this (in your case):JSFiddle: https://jsfiddle.net/hju4nws1/ While this may not be ideal for some use cases, typically if you're fixing a div you probably could care less about what element is its parent/where it falls in the inheritance tree in your DOM, and seems to solve most of the headache - while still allowing both translate and position: fixed to live in (relative) harmony.I ran across the same problem. The only difference is that my element with 'position: fixed' had its 'top' and 'left' style properties set from JS. So I was able to apply a fix:oRect object will contain real (relative to view port) top and left coordinates. So you can adjust your actual oElement.style.top and oElement.style.left properties.I have an off canvas sidebar that uses -webkit-transform: translate3d.  This was preventing me from placing a fixed footer on the page.  I resolved the issue by targeting a class on the html page that is added to the  tag on initialization of the sidebar and then writing a css :not qualifier to state "-webkit-transform: none;" to the html tag when that class is not present on the html tag.  Hope this helps someone out there with this same issue!Try to apply opposite transform to the child element:Add a dynamic class while the element transforms.$('#elementId').addClass('transformed').

Then go on to declare in css, then thenNow position: fixed when provided with a top and z-index property values on a child element just work fine and stay fixed until the parent element transforms. When the transformation is reverted the child element pops as fixed again. This should easen the situation if you are actually using a navigation sidebar that toggles open and closes upon a click, and you have a tab-set which should stay sticky as you scroll down the page.One way to deal with this is to apply the same transform to the fixed element:

They followed the cow paths already there, and built houses where the streets weren't, and after a while it was too much trouble to change.I know this is an old post but as MisterZimbu stated, the color property is defining the values of other properties, as the border-color and, with CSS3, of currentColor.currentColor is very handy if you want to use the font color for other elements (as the background or custom checkboxes and radios of inner elements for example).Example:

[Removing rounded corners from a <select> element in Chrome/Webkit](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5780109/removing-rounded-corners-from-a-select-element-in-chrome-webkit)

The user-agent stylesheet for Chrome gives a border-radius of 5px to all the corners of a <select> element. I've tried getting rid of this by applying a radius of 0px through my external stylesheet, as well inline on the  element itself; I've tried both border-radius:0px and -webkit-border-radius:0px; and I've tried the even more specific border-top-left-radius:0px (along with it's -webkit equivalent).None are working.When I examine the element in webkit's developer tools, the Computed Style still lists the radius as 5px. But if I click the expander arrow next to it to see the specifics, it reads: element.style - 0px. And below that it shows the external css specification I gave of 0px, along with the user-agent stylesheet specification of 5px. And both of those latter two are crossed out, as they should be.Any ideas?

You can use select{ or select.your-custom-class{ instead.If you want square borders and still want the little expander arrow, I recommend this:Some good solutions here but this one doesn't need SVG, preserves the border via outline and sets it flush on the button.While the top answer removes the border, it also removes the arrow which makes it extremely difficult if not impossible for the user to identify the element as a select.My solution was to just stick a white div (with border-radius:0px) behind the select. Set its position to absolute, its height to the height of the select, and you should be good to go!Solution with custom right drop-down arrow, uses only css (no images)One way to keep it simple and avoid messing with the arrows and other such features is just to house it in a div with the same background color as the select tag. Inset box-shadow does the trick.DemoFor some reason it's actually affected by the color of the border??? When you use the standard color the corners stay rounded but if you change the color even slightly the rounding goes away.https://jsfiddle.net/hLg70o70/2/well i got the solution. hope it may help you :)Eliminating the arrows should be avoided. A solution that preserves the dropdown arrows is to first remove styles from the dropdown:Then create div directly before the dropdown in your HTML:And style the div like this:Display inline will keep the div from going to a new line, position absolute removes it from the flow of the page. The end result is a nice clean underline you can style as you'd like, and your dropdown still behaves as the user would expect.Following is the way to do it;I used jordan314's solution, but then I added "border-light" class to select. If you have default border-light class defined in css, you can directly use it. It just defines the border as white). I changed the border to square/remove the radius, and maintained the arrow. Here is what I did:if you don't have the predefined border-light, just add in your css:firefox: 18Set the CSS as Try if it works.

I have the following code which sets up a container which has a height that changes with the width when the browser is re-sized (to maintain a square aspect ratio).HTMLCSSHow can I vertically align the IMG inside the container? All my images have variable heights and the container can't have a fixed height/line height because it's responsive... Please help!Here is a technique to align inline elements inside a parent, horizontally and vertically at the same time:1) In this approach, we create an inline-block (pseudo-)element as the first (or last) child of the parent, and set its height property to 100% to take all the height of its parent.2) Also, adding vertical-align: middle keeps the inline(-block) elements at the middle of the line space. So, we add that CSS declaration to the first-child and our element (the image) both.3) Finally, in order to remove the white space character between inline(-block) elements, we could set the font size of the parent to zero by font-size: 0;.Note: I used Nicolas Gallagher's image replacement technique in the following.This section is not going to answer the question as the OP already knows how to create a responsive container. However, I'll explain how it works.In order to make the height of a container element changes with its width (respecting the aspect ratio), we could use a percentage value for top/bottom padding property.A percentage value on top/bottom padding or margins is relative to the width of the containing block.For instance:Here is the Online Demo. Comment out the lines from the bottom and resize the panel to see the effect.Also, we could apply the padding property to a dummy child or :before/:after pseudo-element to achieve the same result. But note that in this case, the percentage value on padding is relative to the width of the .responsive-container itself.Demo #1.

Demo #2 (Using :after pseudo-element)Using padding-top property causes a huge space at the top or bottom of the content, inside the container.In order to fix that, we have wrap the content by a wrapper element, remove that element from document normal flow by using absolute positioning, and finally expand the wrapper (bu using top, right, bottom and left properties) to fill the entire space of its parent, the container.Here we go:Here is the Online Demo.Here is the WORKING DEMO.Obviously, you could avoid using ::before pseudo-element for browser compatibility, and create an element as the first child of the .img-container:UPDATED DEMO.In order to keep the image inside of the box in lower width, you could set max-height and max-width property on the image:Here is the UPDATED DEMO.With flexbox this is easy:FIDDLEJust add the following to the image container:Use this css, as you already have the markup for it:Here is a working JsBin: http://jsbin.com/ihilUnI/1/editThis solution only works for square images (because a percentage margin-top value depends on the width of the container, not the height). For random-size images, you can do the following:Working JsBin solution: http://jsbin.com/ihilUnI/2/editYou can center an image, both horizontally and vertically, using margin: auto and absolute positioning. Also:Try this oneHere's a technique that allows you to center ANY content both vertically and horizontally!Basically, you just need a two containers and make sure your elements meet the following criteria.If you use this technique, just add your image (along with any other content you want to go with it) to the content box.See also this Fiddle!I came across this thread in search of a solution that:Testing some of the solutions posted above I didn't find one to meet all of this criteria, so I put together this simple one which might be useful for other people needing to do the same:Working example on JSFiddleTryHtmlCSShtml code<div class="image-container">

I want to add a style to a radio button's selected label:HTML:CSSAny ideas what I'm doing wrong? 

2011-01-09 21:00:16Z

I want to add a style to a radio button's selected label:HTML:CSSAny ideas what I'm doing wrong? First of all, you probably want to add the name attribute on the radio buttons. Otherwise, they are not part of the same group, and multiple radio buttons can be checked.  Also, since I placed the labels as siblings (of the radio buttons), I had to use the id and for attributes to associate them together.If you really want to put the checkboxes inside the label, try adding an extra span tag, eg.HTMLCSSThat will set the backgrounds for all siblings of the selected radio button.You are using an adjacent sibling selector (+) when the elements are not siblings. The label is the parent of the input, not it's sibling. CSS has no way to select an element based on it's descendents (nor anything that follows it).You'll need to look to JavaScript to solve this.Alternatively, rearrange your markup:You can add a span to your html and css .Here's an example from my code ...  HTML ( JSX ):CSS to make standard radio button vanish on screen and superimpose custom button image:Here's an accessible solutionAs there is currently no CSS solution to style a parent, I use a simple jQuery one here to add a class to a label with checked input inside it.Don't forget to give the pre-checked input's label the class checkedlabel too

So this is probably native to Chrome/OSX if John is using windows)I got the same issue.I fixed it by removing line-height from my input. Check if there is some lineheight which is causing the problemI had similar issue, my problem was with the side padding, and the solution was with, text-indent, I wasn't realize that text indent effect the placeholder side position.If you want to keep your line-height and force the placeholder to have the same, you can directly edit the placeholder CSS since the newer browser versions. That did the trick for me:worked for me ;)I had a problem, which appears just in internet explorer. Input field was styled Unfortunately in IE the initial placeholder appears not at the correct position. But when I have clicked into the field and then left this field, the placeholder appeared on the right position.My solution was to set:Removing the line-height indeed makes your text align with your placeholder-text, but it doesn't properly solve your problem since you need to adapt your design to this flaw (it's not a bug). Adding vertical-align won't do the deal either. I haven't tried in all browsers, but it doesn't work in Safari 5.1.4 for sure.I have heard of a jQuery fix for this, that is not cross-browser placeholder support (jQuery.placeholder), but for styling placeholders, but I haven't found it yet.In the meantime, you can resolve to the table on this page which shows different browser support for different styles.Edit: Found the plugin! jquery.placeholder.min.js provides you with both full styling capabilities and cross-browser support into the bargain.Setting line-height: 0px; fixed it for me in ChromeI've created a fiddle using your screenshot as a background image and stripping out the extra mark-up, and it seems to work finehttp://jsfiddle.net/fLdQG/2/ (webkit browser required)Does this work for you? If not, can you update the fiddle with your exact mark-up and CSS?I noticed the issue the moment I updated Chrome on os x to the latest stable release (9.0.597.94) so this is a Chrome bug and hopefully will be fixed.I'm tempted not to even attempt to work around this and just wait for the fix. It'll just mean more work taking it out.The placeholder is not affected by line-height and padding is inconsistent on browsers.I have found another solution though.VERTICAL-ALIGN. This is probably the only time it works but try that instead and cave many lines of CSS code.Remove line-height  or set using padding...it's working in all browserI found the answer that remedied my frustrations regarding this on John Catterfeld's blog.If you are using line-height or padding you are going to be frustrated with the resulting placeholder. I haven't found a way around that up to this point.If you want move placeholder text right and leave the cursor on the blank space you need to add space(s) at the start of the placeholder attribute: I have tested almost all methods given here in this page for my Angular app. Only I found solution via &nbsp; that inserts spaces i.e.Angular MaterialNon Angular Material

I am trying to get blue container in the middle of pink one, however seems vertical-align: middle; doesn't do the job in that case.Result:Expectation:Please suggest how can I achieve that. JsfiddleFirst of all note that vertical-align is only applicable to table cells and inline-level elements.There are couple of ways to achieve vertical alignments which may or may not meet your needs. However I'll show you two methods from my favorites:The key point is that a percentage value on top is relative to the height of the containing block; While a percentage value on transforms is relative to the size of the box itself (the bounding box).If you experience font rendering issues (blurry font), the fix is to add perspective(1px) to the transform declaration so it becomes:It's worth noting that CSS transform is supported in IE9+.In this method, we have two sibling inline-block elements which are aligned vertically at the middle by vertical-align: middle declaration.One of them has a height of 100% of its parent and the other is our desired element whose we wanted to align it at the middle.Finally, we should use one of the available methods to remove the gap between inline-level elements.use this : refer this link: https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2013/08/absolute-horizontal-vertical-centering-css/Use flex blox in your absoutely positioned div to center its content.See example https://plnkr.co/edit/wJIX2NpbNhO34X68ZyoY?p=previewCenter vertically and horizontally:You may use display:table/table-cell;Here is simple way using Top object. eg: If absolute element size is 60px.

2013-01-03 14:59:44Z

I'm making an HTML email signature with inline CSS (i.e. CSS in style attributes), and I am curious as to whether it's possible to use the :before and :after pseudo-elements.If so, how would I implement something like this with inline CSS?You can't specify inline styles for pseudo-elements.This is because pseudo-elements, like pseudo-classes (see my answer to this other question), are defined in CSS using selectors as abstractions of the document tree that can't be expressed in HTML. An inline style attribute, on the other hand, is specified within HTML for a particular element.Since inline styles can only occur in HTML, they will only apply to the HTML element that they're defined on, and not to any pseudo-elements it generates.As an aside, the main difference between pseudo-elements and pseudo-classes in this aspect is that properties that are inherited by default will be inherited by :before and :after from the generating element, whereas pseudo-class styles just don't apply at all. In your case, for example, if you place text-align: justify in an inline style attribute for a td element, it will be inherited by td:after. The caveat is that you can't declare td:after with the inline style attribute; you must do it in the stylesheet.as mentioned above: its not possible to call a css pseudo-class / -element inline.

what i now did, is:

give your element a unique identifier, f.ex. an id or a unique class.

and write a fitting <style> elementfugly, but what inline css isnt..?You can use the data in inlineNo you cant target the pseudo-classes or pseudo-elements in inline-css as  David Thomas said.

For more details see this answer by BoltClock about Pseudo-classesWe can also write use same for the pseudo-elements Yes it's possible, just add inline styles for the element which you adding after or before, ExampleYou can't create pseudo elements in inline css.However, if you can create a pseudo element in a stylesheet, then there's a way to style it inline by setting an inline style to its parent element, and then using inherit keyword to style the pseudo element, like this:sometimes this can be handy.As mentioned before, you can't use inline elements for styling pseudo classes. Before and after pseudo classes are states of elements, not actual elements. You could only possibly use 

JavaScript for this.  If you have control over the HTML then you could add a real element instead of a pseudo one.

:before and :after pseudo elements are rendered right after the open tag or right before the close tag.

The inline equivalent for this cssWould be something like this:Keep in mind; Your "real" before and after elements and anything with inline css will greatly increase the size of your pages and ignore page load optimizations that external css and pseudo elements make possible.

I have been struggling with fixed positioning in iPad for a while. I know iScroll and it does not always seem to work (even in their demo). I also know that Sencha has a fix for that, but I couldn't Ctrl + F the source code for that fix.I am hoping that someone may have the solution. The problem is that fixed positioned elements do not get updated when the user pans down/up on an iOS powered mobile Safari.A lot of mobile browsers deliberately do not support position:fixed; on the grounds that fixed elements could get in the way on a small screen.The Quirksmode.org site has a very good blog post that explains the problem: http://www.quirksmode.org/blog/archives/2010/12/the_fifth_posit.htmlAlso see this page for a compatibility chart showing which mobile browsers support position:fixed;: http://www.quirksmode.org/m/css.html(but note that the mobile browser world is moving very quickly, so tables like this may not stay up-to-date for long!)Update:

iOS 5 and Android 4 are both reported to have position:fixed support now. I tested iOS 5 myself in an Apple store today and can confirm that it does work with position fixed. There are issues with zooming in and panning around a fixed element though.I found this compatibility table far more up to date and useful than the quirksmode one:

http://caniuse.com/#search=fixedIt has up to date info on Android, Opera (mini and mobile) & iOS.Fixed positioning doesn't work on iOS like it does on computers.Imagine you have a sheet of paper (the webpage) under a magnifying glass(the viewport), if you move the magnifying glass and your eye, you see a different part of the page. This is how iOS works.Now there is a sheet of clear plastic with a word on it, this sheet of plastic stays stationary no matter what (the position:fixed elements). So when you move the magnifying glass the fixed element appears to move.Alternatively, instead of moving the magnifying glass, you move the paper (the webpage), keeping the sheet of plastic and magnifying glass still. In this case the word on the sheet of plastic will appear to stay fixed, and the rest of the content will appear to move (because it actually is) This is a traditional desktop browser.So in iOS the viewport moves, in a traditional browser the webpage moves. In both cases the fixed elements stay still in reality; although on iOS the fixed elements appear to move.The way to get around this, is to follow the last few paragraphs in this article(basically disable scrolling altogether, have the content in a separate scrollable div (see the blue box at the top of the linked article), and the fixed element positioned absolutely)"position:fixed" now works as you'd expect in iOS5.position: fixed does work on android/iphone for vertical scrolling.  But you need to make sure your meta tags are fully set. e.gAlso if you're planning on having the same page work on android pre 4.0, you need to set the top position also, or a small margin will be added for some reason.now apple support thatFixed Footer (here with jQuery):Hope it helps.I had this problem on Safari (iOS 10.3.3) - the browser was not redrawing until the touchend event fired. Fixed elements did not appear or were cut off.The trick for me was adding transform: translate3d(0,0,0); to my fixed position element.EDIT - I now know why the transform fixes the issue: hardware-acceleration. Adding the 3D transformation triggers the GPU acceleration making for a smooth transition. For more on hardware-acceleration checkout this article: http://blog.teamtreehouse.com/increase-your-sites-performance-with-hardware-accelerated-css. Avoid on the same box using transform:--- and position:fixed. Element will stay in position:static if there is any transform.I ended up using the new jQuery Mobile v1.1: http://jquerymobile.com/blog/2012/04/13/announcing-jquery-mobile-1-1-0/using jquery i am able to come up with this. it doesnt scroll smooth, but it does the trick. you can scroll down, and the fixed div pops up on top.THE CSSTHE HTMLTHE jQUERYFinally we want to determine if the ipod touch in landscape or portrait mode to display accordinglyEven though the CSS attribute {position:fixed;} seems (mostly) working on newer iOS devices, it is possible to have the device quirk and fallback to {position:relative;} on occasion and without cause or reason. Usually clearing the cache will help, until something happens and the quirk happens again.Specifically, from Apple itself Preparing Your Web Content for iPad:What is ironic, Android devices do not seem to have this issue. Also it is entirely possible to use {position:absolute;} when in reference to the body tag and not have any issues.I found the root cause of this quirk; that it is the scroll event not playing nice when used in conjunction with the HTML or BODY tag. Sometimes it does not like to fire the event, or you will have to wait until the scroll swing event is finished to receive the event. Specifically, the viewport is re-drawn at the end of this event and fixed elements can be re-positioned somewhere else in the viewport.So this is what I do: (avoid using the viewport, and stick with the DOM!)In essence this will cause the BODY to be the size of the viewport and non-scrollable. The scrollable DIV nested inside will scroll as the BODY normally would (minus the swing effect, so the scrolling does stop on touchend.) The fixed DIV stays fixed without interference.As a side note, a high z-index value on the fixed DIV is important to keep the scrollable DIV appear to be behind it. I normally add in window resize and scroll events also for cross-browser and alternate screen resolution compatibility.If all else fails, the above code will also work with both the fixed and scrollable DIVs set to {position:absolute;}. The simple way to fix this problem just types transform property for your element. and it will be fixed. Happy Coding :-)Also you can try his way as well this is also work fine.here is my solution to this...CSS HTMLExplanation is that position fixed for the div will keep the div on the background at all time, then we stretch the div to go on all corners of the browser (provided the body margin = 0) using the (left,right,top,bottom) simultaneously.Please make sure you do not use the width and height as this will override the top,left,right,bottom options.

[How to include view/partial specific styling in AngularJS](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/15193492/how-to-include-view-partial-specific-styling-in-angularjs)

What is the proper/accepted way to use separate stylesheets for the various views my application uses?Currently I'm placing a link element in the view/partial's html at the top but I've been told this is bad practice even though all modern browsers support it but I can see why it's frowned upon.The other possibility is placing the separate stylesheets in my index.html's head but I would like it to only load the stylesheet if its view is being loaded in the name of performance.Is this bad practice since styling won't take effect until after the css is loaded form the server, leading to a quick flash of unformatted content in a slow browser? I have yet to witness this although I'm testing it locally.Is there a way to load the CSS through the object passed to Angular's $routeProvider.when?Thanks in advance!

I have yet to witness this although I'm testing it locally.Is there a way to load the CSS through the object passed to Angular's $routeProvider.when?Thanks in advance!I know this question is old now, but after doing a ton of research on various solutions to this problem, I think I may have come up with a better solution.  In case anyone in the future is interested, here's what I came up with:1.  Create a custom directive for the <head> element:This directive does the following things:Note: this requires that your ng-app attribute is on the <html> element, not on <body> or anything inside of <html>.2. Specify which stylesheets belong to which routes using the $routeProvider:This config adds a custom css property to the object that is used to setup each page's route.  That object gets passed to each '$routeChangeStart' event as .$$route.  So when listening to the '$routeChangeStart' event, we can grab the css property that we specified and append/remove those <link /> tags as needed.  Note that specifying a css property on the route is completely optional, as it was omitted from the '/some/route/2' example. If the route doesn't have a css property, the <head> directive will simply do nothing for that route.  Note also that you can even have multiple page-specific stylesheets per route, as in the '/some/route/3' example above, where the css property is an array of relative paths to the stylesheets needed for that route.3. You're done

Those two things setup everything that was needed and it does it, in my opinion, with the cleanest code possible.Hope that helps someone else who might be struggling with this issue as much as I was.@tennisgent's solution is great. However, I think is a little limited.Modularity and Encapsulation in Angular goes beyond routes. Based on the way the web is moving towards component-based development, it is important to apply this in directives as well.As you already know, in Angular we can include templates (structure) and controllers (behavior) in pages and components. AngularCSS enables the last missing piece: attaching stylesheets (presentation).For a full solution I suggest using AngularCSS. https://github.com/door3/angular-cssHere are some examples:RoutesDirectivesAdditionally, you can use the $css service for edge cases:You can read more about AngularCSS here:http://door3.com/insights/introducing-angularcss-css-demand-angularjsCould append a new stylesheet to head within $routeProvider. For simplicity am using a string but could create new link element also, or create a service for stylesheetsBiggest benefit of prelaoding in page is any background images will already exist, and less lieklyhood of FOUC@sz3, funny enough today I had to do exactly what you were trying to achieve: 'load a specific CSS file only when a user access' a specific page. So I used the solution above.But I am here to answer your last question: 'where exactly should I put the code. Any ideas?'You were right including the code into the resolve, but you need to change a bit the format.Take a look at the code below:I've just tested and it's working fine, it injects the html and it loads my 'home.css' only when I hit the '/home' route.Full explanation can be found here, but basically resolve: should get an object in the format You can name the 'key' anything you like - in my case I called 'style'.Then for the value you have two options:The main point here is that the code inside the function is going to be executed before before the controller is instantiated and the $routeChangeSuccess event is fired.Hope that helps.Awesome, thank you!! Just had to make a few adjustments to get it working with ui-router:If you only need your CSS to be applied to one specific view, I'm using this handy snippet inside my controller:This will add a class to my body tag when the state loads, and remove it when the state is destroyed (i.e. someone changes pages). This solves my related problem of only needing CSS to be applied to one state in my application.'use strict';

angular.module('app')

Can I stretch text in CSS? I don't want the font to be bigger, because that makes it appear bolder than smaller text beside it. I just want to stretch the text vertically so it's kind of deformed.  This would be in one div, and then the normal text beside it would be in another div. How can I do this?Yes, you can actually with CSS 2D Transforms. This is supported in almost all modern browsers, including IE9+. Here's an example.HTMLCSSTIP: You may need to add margin to your stretched text to prevent text collisions.I'll answer for horizontal stretching of text, since the vertical is the easy part - just use "transform: scaleY()"letter-spacing just adds space between letters, stretches nothing, but it's kinda relativeinline-block because inline elements are too restrictive and the code below wouldn't work otherwisefont-size to get to the size we want - that way the text will really be of the length it's supposed to be and the text before and after it will appear next to it (scaleX is just for show, the browser still sees the element at its original size when positioning other elements).scaleY to reduce the height of the text, so that it's the same as the text beside it.transform-origin to make the text scale from the top of the line.margin-bottom set to a negative value, so that the next line will not be far below - preferably percentage, so that we won't change the line-height property.

vertical-align set to top, to prevent the text before or after from floating to other heights (since the stretched text has a real size of 32px)-- The simple span element has a font-size, only as a reference.The question asked for a way to prevent the boldness of the text caused by the stretch and I still haven't given one, BUT the font-weight property has more values than just normal and bold.I know, you just can't see that, but if you search for the appropriate fonts, you can use the more values.Technically, no. But what you can do is use a font size that is as tall as you would like the stretched font to be, and then condense it horizontally with font-stretch.The only way I can think of for short texts like "MENU" is to put every single letter in a span and justify them in a container afterwards. Like this:And then the CSS:Always coming back to this page when a designer stretches a font on me. The accepted solution works great, but I frequently run into issues with margins.Would recommend using the transform on the height instead of the width if you're running into issues, was a life safer for me in  my current project.CSS font-stretch is now supported in all major browsers (except iOS Safari and Opera Mini). It is not easy to find a common font-family that supports expanding fonts, but it is easy to find fonts that support condensing, for example:

Can you disable tabs in Bootstrap 2.0 like you can disable buttons?

2012-02-11 02:29:06Z

Can you disable tabs in Bootstrap 2.0 like you can disable buttons?You could remove the data-toggle="tab" attribute from the tab as it's hooked up using live/delegate eventsAs of 2.1, from bootstrap documentation at http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/components.html#navs, you can.See https://github.com/twitter/bootstrap/issues/2764 for the feature add discussion.I added the following Javascript to prevent clicks on disabled links:i think the best solution is disabling with css.

You define a new class and you turn off the mouse events on it:And then you assign this class to the desired li element:You can add/remove the class with jQuery also. For example, to disable all tabs:Here is an example: jsFiddleAlso, I'm using following solution:Now you just adding class 'disabled' to the parent li and tab doesn't work and become gray.Old question but it kind of pointed me in the right direction. The method I went for was to add the disabled class to the li and then added the following code to my Javascript file.This will disable any link where the li has a class of disabled. Kind of similar to totas's answer but it won't run the if every time a user clicks any tab link and it doesn't use return false.Hopefully it'll be useful to someone!For my use, the best solution was a mix of some of the answers here, which are :****NOTE**:** The JS code here is important, even if you remove the data-toggle because otherwise, it will update your URL by adding the #your-id value to it, which is not recommended because your tab is disabled, thus should not be accessed.With only css, you can define two css classes.This is an html template. The only thing needed is to set the class to your preferred list item.Suppose, this is your TAB and you want to disable itSo you can also disable this tab by adding dynamic css In addition to James's answer:If you need to disable the link useIf you need to prevent a disabled link from loading the tabIf you need to unable the linkI tried all suggested answers, but finally i made it work like thisNone of the answers work for me.  Remove data-toggle="tab" from the a prevents the tab from activating, but it also adds the #tabId hash to the URL. That is unacceptable to me.  What is also unacceptable is using javascript.What does work is added the disabled class to the li and removing the href attribute of its containing a.my tabs were in panels, so i added a class='disabled' to the tabs anchorin javascript i added:and for presentation in less i added:Most easy and clean solution to avoid this is adding  onclick="return false;" to a tag.You can disable a tab in bootstrap 4 by adding class disabled to the child of nav-item as followsHere's my attempt.

I'm trying to understand what appears to be unexpected behaviour to me:I have an element with a max-height of 100% inside a container that also uses a max-height but, unexpectedly, the child overflows the parent: Test case: http://jsfiddle.net/bq4Wu/16/This is fixed, however, if the parent is given an explicit height: Test case: http://jsfiddle.net/bq4Wu/17/Does anyone know why the child would not honour the max-height of its parent in the first example? Why is an explicit height required?When you specify a percentage for max-height on a child, it is a percentage of the parent's actual height, not the parent's max-height, oddly enough. The same applies to max-width.So, when you don't specify an explicit height on the parent, then there's no base height for the child's max-height to be calculated from, so max-height computes to none, allowing the child to be as tall as possible. The only other constraint acting on the child now is the max-width of its parent, and since the image itself is taller than it is wide, it overflows the container's height downwards, in order to maintain its aspect ratio while still being as large as possible overall.When you do specify an explicit height for the parent, then the child knows it has to be at most 100% of that explicit height. That allows it to be constrained to the parent's height (while still maintaining its aspect ratio).I played around a little. On a larger image in firefox, I got a good result with using the inherit property value. Will this help you?I found a solution here:

http://www.sitepoint.com/maintain-image-aspect-ratios-responsive-web-design/The trick is possible because it exists a relation between WIDTH and PADDING-BOTTOM of an element. So:parent:child (remove all css related to width, i.e. width:100%):You can use the property object-fitLike suggested hereA full explanation of this property by Chris Mills in Dev.OperaAnd an even better one in CSS-TricksIt's supported inI just checked that vivaldi and chromium support it as well (no surprise here)It's currently not supported on IE, but... who cares ? Also, iOS supports object-fit, but not object-position, but it will soon.Maybe someone else can explain the reasons behind your problem but you can solve it by specifying the height of the container and then setting the height of the image to be 100%. It is important that the width of the image appears before the height.The closest I can get to this is this example:http://jsfiddle.net/YRFJQ/1/orThe main problem is that the height takes the percentage of the containers height, so it is looking for an explicitly set height in the parent container, not it's max-height.The only way round this to some extent I can see is the fiddle above where you can hide the overflow, but then the padding still acts as visible space for the image to flow into, and so replacing with a solid border works instead (and then adding border-box to make it 200px if that's the width you need)Not sure if this would fit with what you need it for, but the best I can seem to get to.Here is a solution for a recently opened question marked as a duplicate of this question.  The <img> tag was exceeding the max-height of the parent <div>.Broken: FiddleWorking: FiddleIn this case, adding display:flex to the 2 parent <div> tags was the answerInstead of going with max-height: 100%/100%, an alternative approach of filling up all the space would be using position: absolute with top/bottom/left/right set to 0.In other words, the HTML would look like the following:You can see a live example at Codesandbox - Overflow within CSS Flex/GridA good solution is to not use height on the parent and use it just on the child with View Port :Fiddle Example: https://jsfiddle.net/voan3v13/1/Containers will already generally wrap their content nicely. It often doesn't work as well the other way around: children don't fill their ancestors nicely. So, set your width/height values on the inner-most element rather than the outer-most element, and let the outer elements wrap their contents.Your container does not have a height.Add

    height: 200px;to the containers css and the kitty will stay inside.

The problem is that when you have to use IFrames to insert content into a website, then in the modern web-world it is expected that the IFrame would be responsive as well. In theory it's simple, simply aider use <iframe width="100%"></iframe> or set the CSS width to iframe { width: 100%; } however in practice it's not quite that simple, but it can be.If the iframe content is fully responsive and can resize itself without internal scroll bars, then iOS Safari will resize the iframe without any real issues.If you consider the following code:With the Content.html:Then this works without issues in iOS 7.1 Safari. You can change between landscape and portrait without any issues.

However by simply changing the Content.html CSS by adding this:You get this:

The problem here is not in the fact that the Content.html is not responsive, but in the fact that the iOS Safari simply resizes the iframe so that the div#ScrolledArea would be fully visible.The solution for this problem is actually quite simple and there are two ways to go about it. If you have control over the Content.html then simply change the div#ScrolledArea width CSS to:Basically the idea here is simple, you set the width to something that is smaller than the viewport (iframe width in this case) and then overwrite it with min-width: 100% to allow for actual width: 100% which iOS Safari by default overwrites. The *width: 100%; is there so the code would remain IE6 compatible, but if you do not care for IE6 you can omit it. Demo

As you can see now, the div#ScrolledArea width is actually 100% and the overflow: scroll; can do it's thing and hide the overflowing content. If you have access to the iframe content, then this is preferable. However if you do not have access to the iframe content (for what ever reason) then you can actually use the same technique on the iframe itself. Simply use the same CSS on the iframe:However, there is one limitation with this, you need to turn off the scrollbars with scrolling="no" on the iframe for this to work:If the scrollbars are allowed, then this wont work on the iframe anymore. That said, if you modify the Content.html instead then you can retain the scrolling in the iframe. DemoThe problem, it seems, is that Mobile Safari will refuse to obey the width of your iFrame if the document it contains is wider than what you have specified. Example:http://jsbin.com/hapituto/1On a desktop browser, you will see an iFrame and a Div both set to 300px. The contents is wider so you can scroll the iFrame.On mobile safari, however, you will notice that the iFrame is auto-expanded to the width of the content. My guess is that this is a workaround for long-standing issues with scrolling content within a page. In the past, if you had a large scrolling iframe on a touch device, you'd get 'stuck' in the iframe as that would be scrolling instead of the page itself. It appears Apple has decided that the default behavior of an iFrame is 'no scroll' and expands to prevent it. One option may be this workaround. Instead of assuming the iFrame will scroll, place the iframe in a DIV that you do have control over and let that scroll. example: http://jsbin.com/zakedaja/1Example markup:On mobile safari, you can now scroll the contents of the now fully-expanded iFrame via the div that is containing it.The catch: This looks really ugly on a desktop browser, as now you have double scrollbars. So you may have to do some browser detection with JS to get around this. I needed a cross-browser solution. Requirements were:Building off what I learned from @Idra regarding scrolling="no" on iOS and this post about fitting iFrame content to the screen in iOS here's what I ended up with.  Hope it helps someone =)HTMLCSSJSThe problem with all these solutions is that the height of the iframe never really changes.This means you won't be able to center elements inside the iframe using Javascript, position:fixed;, or position:absolute; since the iframe itself never scrolls.My solution detailed here is to wrap all the content of the iframe inside a div using this CSS:This way Safari believes the content has no height and lets you assign the height of the iframe properly. This also allows you to position elements in any way you wish.You can see a quick and dirty demo here.This issue is also present on iOS Chrome.I glanced through all the solutions above, most are very hacky.If you don't need support for older browsers, just set the iframe width to 100vw;Note : Check support for viewport units

Can I define a class name on paragraph using Markdown? If so, how?

Can I define a class name on paragraph using Markdown? If so, how?Dupe: How do I set an HTML class attribute in Markdown?No, Markdown's syntax can't. You can set ID values with Markdown Extra through.You can use regular HTML if you like, and add the attribute markdown="1" to continue markdown-conversion within the HTML element. This requires Markdown Extra though.I found the following online:FunctionMarkdownResultRaw HTML is actually perfectly valid in markdown.  For instance:Just make sure the HTML is not inside a code block.If your environment is JavaScript, use markdown-it along with the plugin markdown-it-attrs:OutputjsfiddleNote: Be aware of the security aspect when allowing attributes in your markdown!Disclaimer, I'm the author of markdown-it-attrs.Markdown should have this capability, but it doesn't. Instead, you're stuck with language-specific Markdown supersets:PHP: Markdown Extra

Ruby: Kramdown, MarukuBut if you need to abide by true Markdown syntax, you're stuck with inserting raw HTML, which is less ideal.Here is a working example for kramdown following @Yarin's answer.Reference: https://kramdown.gettalong.org/syntax.html#inline-attribute-listsIf your flavour of markdown is kramdown, then you can set css class like this: Then in you css file, you set the css like this: As mentioned above markdown itself leaves you hanging on this.  However, depending on the implementation there are some workarounds:At least one version of MD considers <div> to be a block level tag but <DIV> is just text.  All broswers however are case insensitive.  This allows you to keep the syntax simplicity of MD, at the cost of adding div container tags.So the following is a workaround:The downside of this is that the output code has <p> tags wrapping the <div> lines (both of them, the first because it's not  and the second because it doesn't match.  No browser fusses about this that I've found, but the code won't validate.  MD tends to put in spare <p> tags anyway.Several versions of markdown implement the convention <tag markdown="1"> in which case MD will do the normal processing inside the tag.  The above example becomes:The current version of Fletcher's MultiMarkdown allows attributes to follow the link if using referenced links.In slim markdown use this:Translates to:It should also be mentioned that <span> tags allow inside them -- block-level items negate MD natively inside them unless you configure them not to do so, but in-line styles natively allow MD within them. As such, I often do something akin to...I am not 100% sure if this is universal but seems to be the case in all MD editors I've used.If you just need a selector for Javascript purposes (like I did), you might just want to use a href attribute instead of a class or id:Just do this:Markdown will not ignore or remove the href attribute like it does with classes and ids.So in your Javascript or jQuery you can then do:At least this works in my version of Markdown...

(index):1 Failed to decode downloaded font: http://dev.xyz/themes/custom/xyz_theme/fonts/xyz_rock/rocksansbold/Rock-SansBold.woff2If you got this error message while trying to commit your font then it is an issue with .gitattributes

 "warning: CRLF will be replaced by LF"The solution for this is adding whichever font you are getting the issue with in .gitattributesThen I deleted corrupt font files and reapplied the new font files and is working great. try and rename your file to application.css.scssI had a corrupted font, although it appeared to be loading without problem and under Sources in Chrome devtools appeared to display, the byte count wasn't correct, so I downloaded again and it resolved it.I had the same issue and that was because of the git treating these files as text. So while checking out the files in build agents, binary was not maintained.Add this to your .gitattributes file and try.Just state format at @font-face as following:When using angular-cli, this is what works for me:I was getting the following errors:which was fixed after downloading the raw file directly from:

https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/blob/master/fonts/glyphicons-halflings-regular.woff2The problem was that there was a proxy error when downloading the file (it contained the HTML error message).Go to the address below on GitHub and download each of the FontAwesome files.https://github.com/FortAwesome/font-awesome-sass/tree/master/assets/fonts/font-awesome...but instead of right-clicking and saving the link as, click on each of the files and use the 'Download' button to save them. I found that saving the link as downloaded an HTML page and not the FontAwesome file binary itself. Once I had all of the binaries it worked for me. My issue was that I was declaring two fonts, and scss seems to expect that you declare the name of the font.after your 

@font-face{}

you must declare 

$my-font: "OpenSans3.0 or whatever";and this for each font-face. :-)For angular-cli and webpack users I suspected that there is some issue while importing the fonts in css file , so please also provide url location encoded with single quotes as following  - This post might be old , but this is the solution which worked for me .I've had the same issue.Adding the font version (e.g. ?v=1.101) to the font URLS should do the trick ;)Clicking (right mouse click) on font's TTF version and selecting "Get Info" (Mac OSX) "Properties" (Windows) in context menu should be enough to access the font version.If your are using Chrome, try adding an opentype (OTF) version of your font as shown below:Cheers!If you use bootstrap then Update bootstrap css(bootstrap.min.css) file and fonts files. I fixed my problem with this solution.I am using ASP.NET with IIS and it turns out I just needed to add

the MIME-type to IIS: '.woff2' / 'application/font-woff'After trying lots of other approaches, and lots of re-installs and checks, I have just fixed the issue by clearing out browsing data from Chrome (cached images and files) and then refreshing the page.I had same problem when I opened and saved .woff and .woff2 files through Sublime Text with EditorConfig option end_of_line = lf.

I just copied files to font folder without opening them into Sublime and problem was solved.If other answers didn't work try:Check your font's css file. (fontawesome.css/fontawesome.min.css), you will see like this:you will see version tag after your font's file extension name. Like:You just need to remove this tag from your css file.

After removing this, you need to go to your fonts folder, And you will see:

And, Form these font's files, you just need to remove the version tag -v=4.6.3 from the file name.Then, The problem will be sloved.just in case this is relevant for someone. I got the exact same error using ASP.NET and C# in Visual studio. When I started the app from within the visual studio it worked, but I got this issue. In the meantime, it turned out, that the path to my project contained the character "#" (c:\C#\testapplication). This seems to confuse IIS Express (maybe also IIS) and causes this issue. I guess "#" is a reserved character somewhere in ASP.NET or below. Changing the path helped and now it works as expected.Regards

What am I doing wrong?CSSOne way is to use the multiple class selector (no space as that is the descendant selector):http://jsfiddle.net/geatR/Another would be to use the :not() selectorhttp://jsfiddle.net/geatR/1/In modern browsers you can do:Consult http://caniuse.com/css-sel3 for compatibility information.The problem with your code is that you are selecting the .remode_hover that is a descendant of .remode_selected. So the first part of getting your code to work correctly is by removing that spaceThen, in order to get the style to not work, you have to override the style set by the :hover. In other words, you need to counter the background-color property. So the final code will be FiddleAn alternative method would be to use :not(), as stated by others. This will return any element that doesn't have the class or property stated inside the parenthesis. In this case, you would put .remode_selected in there. This will target all elements that don't have a class of .remode_selectedFiddleHowever, I would not recommend this method, because of the fact that it was introduced in CSS3, so browser support is not ideal.A third method would be to use jQuery. You can target the .not() selector, which would be similar to using :not() in CSS, but with much better browser supportFiddle

However, based on some research it won't be valid code. So to sum it up again, I need the entire div (#parentdivimage) to be a href link. You'll need to choose between the following scenarios:which is semantically incorrect, but it will work.which is semantically correct but it involves using JS.which is semantically correct and works as expected but is not a div any more.Why don't you strip out the <div> element and replace it with an <a> instead?  Just because the anchor tag isn't a div doesn't mean you can't style it with display:block, a height, width, background, border, etc.  You can make it look like a div but still act like a link.  Then you're not relying on invalid code or JavaScript that may not be enabled for some users.Do it like this: Parentdivimage should have specified width and height, and its position should be:Just inside the parentdivimage, next to other divs that parent contains you should put:Then in css file:The span tag will fill out its parent block which is parentdiv, because of height and width set to 100%. Span will be on the top of all of surrounding elements because of setting z-index higher than other elements. Finally span will be clickable, because it's inside of an 'a' tag.Two things you can do:Going off of what Surreal Dreams said, it's probably best to style the anchor tag in my experience, but it really does depend on what you are doing.  Here's an example:Html:Then the CSS:http://jsbin.com/zijijuduqo/1/edit?html,css,outputMake the div of id="childdivimag" a span instead, and wrap that in an a element. As the span and img are in-line elements by default this remains valid, whereas a div is a block level element, and therefore invalid mark-up when contained within an a.put display:block on the anchor element. and/or zoom:1; but you should just really do this. What I would do is put a span inside the <a> tag, set the span to block, and add size to the span, or just apply the styling to the <a> tag. Definitely handle the positioning in the <a> tag style. Add an onclick event to the a where JavaScript will catch the event, then return false at the end of the JavaScript event to prevent default action of the href and bubbling of the click. This works in cases with or without JavaScript enabled, and any AJAX can be handled in the Javascript listener. If you're using jQuery, you can use this as your listener and omit the onclick in the a tag. this allows you to attach listeners to any changed elements as necessary.A link with <div> tags:A link with <a> tags:This can be done in many ways.

Can anybody please tell me why? I thought that if I define the width of the parent div, then the unordered list should be able to center itself with margin: 0 auto. What am I missing?Here is my code: You need to define the width of the element you are centering, not the parent element.Edit: Ok, I've seen the testpage now, and here is how I think you want it:An inline-block covers the whole line (from left to right), so a margin left and/or right won't work here. What you need is a block, a block has borders on the left and the right so can be influenced by margins.This is how it works for me:Why not?I don't know why the first answer is the best one, I tried it and not working in fact, as @kalys.osmonov said, you can give text-align:center to header, but you have to make ul as inline-block rather than inline, and also you have to notice that text-align can be inherited which is not good to some degree, so the better way (not working below IE 9) is using margin and transform. Just remove float right and margin;0 auto from ul, like below: This way can fix the problem that making dynamic width of ul center if you don't care IE8 etc.We can set the width for ul tag then it will align center.

I have a form that has three submit buttons as follows:The row of buttons is a mix of submit, reset and JavaScript buttons. The order of buttons is subject to change, but in any case the save button remains between prev and next buttons.The problem here is that when a user hits Enter to submit the form, the post variable "COMMAND" contains "Prev"; normal, as this is the first submit button on the form. I however want the "Next" button to be triggered when the user submits the form via the Enter button. It is kind of like setting it as the default submit button, even though there are other buttons before it.My suggestion is don't fight this behaviour. You can effectively alter the order using floats. For example:with:will effectively reverse the order and thus the "Next" button will be the value triggered by hitting enter.This kind of technique will cover many circumstances without having to resort to more hacky JavaScript methods.The first button is always the default; it can't be changed. Whilst you can try to fix it up with JavaScript, the form will behave unexpectedly in a browser without scripting, and there are some usability/accessibility corner cases to think about. For example, the code linked to by Zoran will accidentally submit the form on Enter press in a <input type="button">, which wouldn't normally happen, and won't catch IE's behaviour of submitting the form for Enter press on other non-field content in the form. So if you click on some text in a <p> in the form with that script and press Enter, the wrong button will be submitted... especially dangerous if, as given in that example, the real default button is ‘Delete’!My advice would be to forget about using scripting hacks to reassign defaultness. Go with the flow of the browser and just put the default button first. If you can't hack the layout to give you the on-screen order you want, then you can do it by having a dummy invisible button first in the source, with the same name/value as the button you want to be default:(note: positioning is used to push the button off-screen because display: none and visibility: hidden have browser-variable side-effects on whether the button is taken as default and whether it's submitted.)Set type=submit to the button you'd like to be default and type=button to other buttons. Now in the form below you can hit Enter in any input fields, and the Render button will work (despite the fact it is the second button in the form). Example:Tested in FF24 and Chrome 35.Quick'n'dirty you could create an hidden duplicate of the submit-button, which should be used, when pressing enter.If someone now hits enter in your form, the (hidden) next-button will be used as submitter.Tested on IE9, Firefox, Chrome and OperaIf you're using jQuery, this solution from a comment made here is pretty slick:Just add class="default" to the button you want to be the default. It puts a hidden copy of that button right at the beginning of the form.I'm resurrecting this because I was researching a non-JavaScript way to do this. I wasn't into the key handlers, and the CSS positioning stuff was causing tab ordering to break since CSS repositioning doesn't change tab order. My solution is based on the response at https://stackoverflow.com/a/9491141. The solution source is below. tabindex is used to correct tab behaviour of the hidden button, as well as aria-hidden to avoid having the button read out by screen readers / identified by assistive devices. 1st button in DOM

  2nd button in DOM

  3rd button in DOMEssential CSS for this solution:Another solution, using jQuery:This should work on the following forms, making "Update" the default action:As well as:This traps the Enter key only when an input field on the form has focus.You should not be using buttons of the same name.  It's bad semantics.  Instead, you should modify your backend to look for different name values being set:Since I don't know what language you are using on the backend, I'll give you some pseudocode:bobince's solution has the downside of creating a button which can be Tab-d over, but otherwise unusable. This can create confusion for keyboard users.A different solution is to use the little-known form attribute:This is standard HTML, however unfortunately not supported in Internet Explorer.

Or "2" to minimize file size?SVG profilesNote: SVG Tiny does not reduce the file size, it's just a subset of SVG that is adequate for low processing power devices. It will discard gradients, opacity, embedded fonts and filters. Erik Dahlström says: All SVG 1.1 full viewers should be able to display all of the SVG 1.1 Tiny/Basic content (according to spec), and probably all of the SVG 1.2 Tiny content that Illustrator produces too.Fonts note: if you don't have any text in your image this setting doesn't matter.Subsetting:Images: this only matters if you are including bitmap imagesNote that linked bitmap images won't display if the SVG is displayed through the <img> tag, because img doesn't allow loading external resources. Furthermore: webkit has a bug that does not display bitmap images within svg files even if you embed them. In short: use a plain <svg> tag if you intend to embed or link bitmap images, don't use <img>.Preserve Illustrator Editing CapabilitiesI prefer to save an .ai file as my source image, and to think of the SVG file as an Export for web feature. That way you focus on reducing file size and have a pristine copy of your vector file with all the editing capabilities. So don't choose this.Decimal PlacesThe default 3 is a sane setting and you can mostly forget about it. However, if you have a really complicated paths with many points lowering this setting to 1 or even 0 will reduce the file size substantially. But you must be careful because bezier segments are very sensitive to this setting and they might seem a little distorted. So if you lower this setting always make sure it looks acceptable in a browser. EncodingThe explanation behind character encoding is rather technical, and it only concerns svg files with text. The most likely encoding you need is UTF-8, do not change this unless you know what you're doing.

I want to make it so that a whole div is clickable and links to another page when clicked without JavaScript and with valid code/markup.If I have this which is what I want the result to do - The W3C validator says that block elements shouldn't be placed inside an inline element. Is there a better way to do this?Pedantic answer: No.As you've already put on another comment, it's invalid to nest a div inside an a tag.However, there's nothing preventing you from making your a tag behave very similarly to a div, with the exception that you cannot nest other block tags inside it. If it suits your markup, set display:block on your a tag and size / float it however you like.If you renege on your question's premise that you need to avoid javascript, as others have pointed our you can use the onClick event handler. jQuery is a popular choice for making this easy and maintainable.Update:In HTML5, placing a <div> inside an <a> is valid.See http://dev.w3.org/html5/markup/a.html#a-changes (thanks Damien)It is possible to make a link fill the entire div which gives the appearance of making the div clickable.CSS:HTML:Without JS, I am doing it like this:My HTML:My CSS:My solution without JavaScript/images. Only CSS used. It works in all browsers.HTML:CSS:There is an example on https://www.redracingparts.com/english/motorbikesmotorcycles/stackoverflow/examples/div/clickable.phpNesting block level elements in anchors is not invalid anymore in HTML5. See http://html5doctor.com/block-level-links-in-html-5/ and http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/the-a-element.html.

I'm not saying you should use it, but in HTML5 it's fine to use <a href="#"><div></div></a>.The accepted answer is otherwise the best one. Using JavaScript like others suggested is also bad because it would make the "link" inaccessible (to users without JavaScript, which includes search engines and others).jQuery would allow you to do that.Look up the click() function:

http://api.jquery.com/click/Example:Well you could either add <a></a> tags and place the div inside it, adding an href if you want the div to act as a link. Or else just use Javascript and define an 'OnClick' function. But from the limited information provided, it's a bit hard to determine what the context of your problem is.Something like this? AFAIK you will need at least a little bit of JavaScript...I would suggest to use jQuery.You can include this library in one line. And then you can access your div withand respond to the click event.we are using like this using tag and catching is with hope this helps.

So effectively having the class pull-right only for col-lg-6...How could I achieve this?Here is a fiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/thibs/Y6WPz/Thank-you You could put "element 2" in a smaller column (ie: col-2) and then use push on larger screens only:Demo: http://bootply.com/88095Another option is to override the float of .pull-right using a @media query..Lastly, another option is to create your own .pull-right-lg CSS class..UPDATEBootstrap 4 includes responsive floats, so in this case you'd just use float-lg-right. No extra CSS is needed.Bootstrap 4 DemoTry this LESS snippet (It's created from the examples above & the media query mixins in grid.less). There is no need to create your own class with media queries. Bootstrap 3 already has float ordering for media breakpoints under Column Ordering: http://getbootstrap.com/css/#grid-column-orderingThe syntax for the class is col-<#grid-size>-(push|pull)-<#cols> where <#grid-size> is xs, sm, md or lg and <#cols> is how far you want the column to move for that grid size. Push or pull is left or right of course.I use it all the time so I know it works well.Works fine too:Adding the CSS shown below to your Bootstrap 3 application enables support forclasses that work exactly like the newclasses that have been introduced in Bootstrap 4:Apart from that, it addsfor completeness, being compatible withfrom Bootstrap 4.For those interested in text alignment, a simple solution is to create a new class:Then add that class:It is very simple using Sass, just use @extend:This is what i am using . change @screen-md-max for other sizesThis problem is solved in bootstrap-4-alpha-2.Here is the link:

http://blog.getbootstrap.com/2015/12/08/bootstrap-4-alpha-2/Clone it on github:

https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/tree/v4.0.0-alpha.2Just use bootstrap's responsive utility classes!The best solution for that task is to use the following code:Element will be aligned to the right only on lg screens - on the rest the display attribute will be set to block as it is by default for div element.

This approach is using text-right class on the parent element instead of pull-right.Alternative solution:The biggest disadvantage is that the html code inside needs to be repeated twice.You can use push and pull to change column ordering. You pull one column and push the other on large devices:now include bootstrap 4:and code should be like this:

I have a header div as the first element in my wrapper div, but when I add a top margin to a h1 inside the header div it pushes the entire header div down. I realize this happens whenever I apply a top margin to the first visible element on a page. Here is a sample code snippet. Thanks!put overflow:auto in the parent div

see more in this linkI don't have a solid explanation on why this happens, but I've fixed this by changing the top-margin to top-padding, or adding display: inline-block to the element style.EDIT: This is my theoryI have a feeling it has something to do with how margins are collapsed (combined).from W3C Collapsing Margins:My theory is that since your first element is next to the body the two margins combine and are applied to the body: this forces the body's content to start below the applied collapsed margin in compliance with the box model.There are situations where the margins do not collapse which might be worth playing around with (from Collapsing Margins):This are some of the ways to avoid margin collapsing between parent-child elements. Use the one that fits better with the rest of your styling:I know this is an old issue, I've come across it many times. The problem is that all of the fixes here are hacks that would potentially have unintended consequences. First off, there's an easy explanation for the root problem. Due to the way that margin collapsing works, if the first element inside a container has a top margin, that top margin is effectively applied to the parent container itself. You can test this on your own by doing the following:In a debugger, open this up and hover the div. You'll notice that the div itself actually is placed where the top-margin of the H1 element stops. This behavior is intended by the browser.So there's an easy fix to this without having to resort to strange hacks, as most of the posts here do (no insults intended, its just the truth) - simply go back to the original explanation - ...if the first element inside a container has a top margin... - Following that, you'd therefore need the first element in a container to NOT have a top margin. Okay, but how do you do that without adding elements that don't interfere semantically with your document?Easy! Pseudo-elements! You could do this via a class or a pre-defined mixin. Add a :before pseudo-element:CSS via a class:With this, following the above markup example you would modify your div as such:Why does this work?The first element in a container, if it has no top-margin, sets the position of the start of the next element's top margin. By adding a :before pseudo-element, the browser actually adds a non-semantic (in other words, good for SEO) element into the parent container before your first element.Q. Why the height: .0000001em?A. A height is required for the browser to push the margin element down. This height is effectively zero, but it will still allow you to add padding to the parent container itself. Since it's effectively zero, it won't have an effect on the layout of the container, either. Beautiful.Now you can add a class (or better, in SASS/LESS, a mixin!) to fix this problem instead of adding weird display styles that will cause unexpected consequences when you want to do other things with your elements, purposefully eliminating margins on elements and/or replacing it with padding, or strange position/float styles that really aren't intended to resolve this issue.display: flex will work in this case. Give parent element display: flex; and then give margin as per your requirement to the h1 tag.  Run into this issue today.overflow: hidden didn't worked as expected when I had more elements followed.So I tried changing the parent div's display property and display: flex worked !!!Hope this may help someone. :)Adding a tiny bit of padding to the parent element top can fix this issue.This is useful if you need an element inside the parent to be visible outside the parent element, like if you are creating an overlapping effect.This happens because of margin collapse.

If you use top it won't add anything to the line box, but you may have to reduce font size further to make it fit:Another hack you could try is to use positioning to move it up a bit without affecting the line box:Of course this runs the risk of crashing into the line above if you don't have enough line-height.The trick is to set the <sup>'s line-height to 0. @Scott said to use normal, but this doesn't always work.This means you don't have to change the line-height of surrounding text to accommodate the superscript text. I've tested this in IE7+ and the other major browsers.I had the same problem and non of the given answers worked. But I found a git commit with a fix that did work for me:keep it easy:[font-size dependent on your individual type-face]I prefer to use length on the vertical-align. This aligns the baseline of the element at the given length above the baseline of its parent.The reason why the <sup> tag is affecting the spacing between two lines has to do with a number of factors. The factors are: line height, size of the superscript in relation to the regular font, the line height of the superscript and last but not least what is the bottom of the superscript aligning with...

If you set... the line height of regular text to be in a "tunnel band" (that's what I call it) of 135% then regular text (the 100%) gets white padded by 35% of more white. For a paragraph this looks like this:If you then do not white pad the superscript...(i.e. keep its line height to 0) the superscript only has the width of its own text... if you then ask the superscript to be a percentage of the regular font (for example 70%) and you align it with the middle of the regular text (text-middle), you can eliminate the problem and get a superscript that looks like a superscript. Here it is: I prefer the solution suggested here, as exemplified by this jsfiddle:CSS:HTML:The beauty of this solution is that you can tailor the vertical positioning of the superscript and subscript, to avoid any clashes with the line above or below... in the above, just increase or decrease the 0.2em to suit your requirements.To make all lines taller, to look the same as the line with the superscript, define a larger line-height for the entire paragraphor whatever value gives the effect you desire.It may look strange, but that's how you described your requirements.EDIT: In order to make all lines look the same when only one needs more vertical space than the others, ALL lines in the paragraph will have to be taller.This, as I said, may not an attractive solution. Maybe something can be done with a span making just the text with the sub/superscript smaller, apart from that I don't believe what you want can be achieved. But I'd like to see someone else's solution.EDIT2: Incidentally, I've tried a small html file containingAnd the lines are all the same height in FF3.0.14 and Konqueror (I can't speak for other browsers)I've been using line-height: normal for the superscript, which works fine for me in Safari, Chrome, and Firefox, but I'm not sure about IE.

I am trying to change the CSS using jQuery:What am I missing here?

2010-09-16 19:25:45Z

I am trying to change the CSS using jQuery:What am I missing here?Ignore the people that are suggesting that the property name is the issue.  The jQuery API documentation explicitly states that either notation is acceptable: http://api.jquery.com/css/The actual problem is that you are missing a closing curly brace on this line:Change it to this:Here's a working demo: http://jsfiddle.net/YPYz8/You can do either:Or:To clear things up a little, since some of the answers are providing incorrect information:The jQuery .css() method allows the use of either DOM or CSS notation in many cases. So, both backgroundColor and background-color will get the job done.Additionally, when you call .css() with arguments you have two choices as to what the arguments can be. They can either be 2 comma separated strings representing a css property and its value, or it can be a Javascript object containing one or more key value pairs of CSS properties and values.In conclusion the only thing wrong with your code is a missing }. The line should read:You cannot leave the curly brackets out, but you may leave the quotes out from around backgroundColor and color. If you use background-color you must put quotes around it because of the hyphen.In general, it's a good habit to quote your Javascript objects, since problems can arise if you do not quote an existing keyword.A final note is that about the jQuery .ready() methodis synonymous with:as well as with a third not recommended form.This means that $(init) is completely correct, since init is the handler in that instance. So, init will be fired when the DOM is constructed.When you are using Multiple css property with jQuery then you must use the curly Brace in starting and in the end. You are missing the ending curly brace.You can have a look at this jQuery CSS Selector tutorial. Just wanted to add that when using numbers for values with the css method you have to add them outside the apostrophe and then add the CSS unit in apostrophes.orThe .css() method makes it super simple to find and set CSS properties and combined with other methods like .animate(), you can make some cool effects on your site.In its simplest form, the .css() method can set a single CSS property for a particular set of matched elements. You just pass the property and value as strings and the element’s CSS properties are changed.$('.example').css('background-color', 'red');This would set the ‘background-color’ property to ‘red’ for any element that had the class of ‘example’.But you aren’t limited to just changing one property at a time. Sure, you could add a bunch of identical jQuery objects, each changing just one property at a time, but this is making several, unnecessary calls to the DOM and is a lot of repeated code.Instead, you can pass the .css() method a Javascript object that contains the properties and values as key/value pairs. This way, each property will then be set on the jQuery object all at once.This will change all of these CSS properties on the ‘.example’ elements.$(".radioValue").css({"background-color":"-webkit-linear-gradient(#e9e9e9,rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.43137254901960786),#e9e9e9)","color":"#454545",    "padding": "8px"});wrong code:$("#myParagraph").css({"backgroundColor":"black","color":"white");its  missing   "}" after white"change it to this

Padding within inputs breaks width 100%

[Padding within inputs breaks width 100%](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1377719/padding-within-inputs-breaks-width-100)

Ok, so we know that setting padding to an object causes its width to change even if it is set explicitly. While one can argue the logic behind this, it causes some problems with some elements.For most cases, you just add a child element and add padding to that one instead of the one set to 100%, but for form inputs, that's not a possible step.Take a look at this: http://sandman.net/test/formcss.htmlThe second input has its padding set to 5px which I very much prefer to the default setting. But unfortunately that makes the input grow 10px in all directions, including adding 10px to the 100% width.Problem here is that I can't add a child element inside the input so I can't fix it. So the question is:Is there any way to add padding inside the input while still keeping the width 100%? It need to be 100% since the forms will render in different width parents so I don't know beforehand the width of the parent.

So the question is:Is there any way to add padding inside the input while still keeping the width 100%? It need to be 100% since the forms will render in different width parents so I don't know beforehand the width of the parent.Using CSS3 you can use the property box-sizing to alter how the browser calculate the width of the input.You can read more about it here: http://css-tricks.com/box-sizing/I don't know how cross browser compatible it is (it works in firefox and safari), but you could try this solution:(Only posted the values that I changed)One option is to wrap the INPUT in a DIV which has the padding.CSS:HTML:The oft-forgotten calc can come to the rescue here:Since we know the padding will add to the width of the element, we simply subtract the padding from the overall width. It's supported by all major browsers, is responsive, and doesn't require messy wrapper divs.I've been having some issues with something similar to this. I have tds with inputs of 100% and a small padding. What I did was compensate for the padding on the td as follows:padding of 8px to include the border and padding of the input/textarea. 

Hope this helps!Perhaps take the border+background off the input, and instead enclose it in a div with border+background and width:100%, and set a margin on the input?One solution I have found works is to absolutely position the input with a relatively positioned parent tag.The apply the style:The only thing to be aware of is that the paragraph tag needs a height setting as its absolutely positioned children will not expand its height. This avoids the need to set width: 100% by locking it to the left and right sides of the parent element.Try using percentages for your padding:If you're worried about users on old browsers who can't see the box-shadow, just give the input a subtle background colour as backup. If you're using pixels for this sort of thing, then the chances are you're using them elsewhere, which could present a few extra-challenges, let me know if you encounter them.Only thing I know to prevent this is assign values like that 100%-10. But it has some compatibility issues tho.

How can I move it to the right?Useposition:absolute;

right: 0;No need for float:right with absolute positioningAlso, make sure the parent element is set to position:relative; Generally speaking, float is a relative positioning statement, since it specifies the position of the element relative to its parent container (floating to the right or left). This means it's incompatible with the position:absolute property, because position:absolute is an absolute positioning statement. You can either float an element and allow the browser to position it relative to its parent container, or you can specify an absolute position and force the element to appear in a certain position regardless of its parent. If you want an absolutely-positioned element to appear on the right side of the screen, you can use position: absolute; right: 0;, but this will cause the element to always appear on the right edge of the screen regardless of how wide its parent div is (so it won't be "at the right of its parent div").You can use "translateX(-100%)" and "text-align: right" if your absolute element is "display: inline-block"You will get absolute-element aligned to the right relative its parentPerhaps you should divide your content like such using floats:Notice the overflow: auto;, this is to ensure that you have some height to your container.  Floating things takes them out of the DOM, to ensure that your elements below don't overlap your wandering floats, set a container div to have an overflow: auto (or overflow: hidden) to ensure that floats are accounted for when drawing your height.  Check out more information on floats and how to use them here.I was able to absolutely position a right-floated element with one layer of nesting and a tricky margin:I decided to make this toggleable so you can see how it does not affect the flow of the surrounding text (run it and press the button to show/hide the floated absolute box).

Support looks pretty decent, though.:nth-last-child(-n+2) should do the trickBecause of the definition of the semantics of nth-child, I don't see how this is possible without including the length of the list of elements involved. The point of the semantics is to allow segregation of a bunch of child elements into repeating groups (edit - thanks BoltClock) or into a first part of some fixed length, followed by "the rest".  You sort-of want the opposite of that, which is what nth-last-child gives you.If you are using jQuery in your project, or are willing to include it you can call nth-last-child through its selector API (this is this simulated it will cross browser). Here is a link to an nth-last-child plugin.  If you took this method of targeting the elements you were interested in:And then style again the last class instead of the nth-child or nth-last-child pseudo selectors, you will have a much more consistent cross browser experience.

but this didn't work on IE9.SEE Fiddle on IE9.

all what i need is remove the arrow in ie9

Please JSFIDDLE answer. In IE9, it is possible with purely a hack as advised by @Spudley.  Since you've customized height and width of the div and select, you need to change div:before css to match yours.In case if it is IE10 then using below css3 it is possibleHowever if you're interested in jQuery plugin, try Chosen.js or you can create your own in js.I would suggest mine solution that you can find  in this GitHub repo.

This works also for IE8 and IE9 with a custom arrow that comes from an icon font.Examples of Custom Cross Browser Drop-down in action: check them with all your browsers to see the cross-browser feature.Anyway, let's start with the modern browsers and then we will see the solution for the older ones.For these browser, it is easy to set the same background image for the drop-down in order to have the same arrow.To do so, you have to reset the browser's default style for the select tag and set new background rules (like suggested before).The appearance rules are set to none to reset browsers default ones, if you want to have the same aspect for each arrow, you should keep them in place.The background rules in the examples are set with SVG inline images that represent different arrows. They are positioned 98% from left to keep some margin to the right border (you can easily modify the position as you wish).In order to maintain the correct cross-browser behavior, the only other rule that have to be left in place is the outline. This rule resets the default border that appears (in some browsers) when the element is clicked. All the others rules can be easily modified if needed.This is the harder part... Or maybe not.There is no standard rule to hide the default arrows for these browsers (like the select::-ms-expand for IE10+). The solution is to hide the part of the drop-down that contains the default arrow and insert an arrow icon font (or a SVG, if you prefer) similar to the SVG that is used in the other browsers (see the select CSS rule for more details about the inline SVG used).The very first step is to set a class that can recognize the browser: this is the reason why I have used the conditional IE IFs at the beginning of the code. These IFs are used to attach specific classes to the html tag to recognize the older IE browser.After that, every select in the HTML have to be wrapped by a div (or whatever tag that can wraps an element). At this wrapper just add the class that contains the icon font.In easy words, this wrapper is used to simulate the select tag.To act like a drop-down, the wrapper must have a border, because we hide the one that comes from the select.Notice that we cannot use the select border because we have to hide the default arrow lengthening it 25% more than the wrapper. Consequently its right border should not be visible because we hide this 25% more by the overflow: hidden rule applied to the select itself.The custom arrow icon-font is placed in the pseudo class :before where the rule content contains the reference for the arrow (in this case it is a right parenthesis).We also place this arrow in an absolute position to center it as much as possible (if you use different icon fonts, remember to adjust them opportunely by changing top and left values and the font size).You can easily create and substitute the background arrow or the icon font arrow, with every one that you want simply changing it in the background-image rule or making a new icon font file by yourself.In case you want to use the class and pseudo-class:.simple-control is your css class:disabled is pseudo class

[bootstrap button shows blue outline when clicked](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/23333231/bootstrap-button-shows-blue-outline-when-clicked)

2014-04-28 05:36:44Z

I added this but still the blue outline appear when the button is clicked.how to remove that ugly thingy?May be your properties are getting overridden.

Try attaching  !important to your code along with the :active .Also add box-shadow because otherwise you will still see the shadow around button.In the latest version of Bootstrap, I found removing outline itself doesn't work. And I have to add this because there is also a box-shadow:There are built-in boostrap class shadow-none for disabling box-shadow (not outline) (https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.1/utilities/shadows/). This removes shadow of button:Try Below CodeThis was happening to me in Chrome (though not in Firefox). I've found out that the outline property was being set by Bootstrap as outline: 5px auto -webkit-focus-ring-color;. Solved by overriding the outline property later in my custom CSS as follows:this will solve button with a text, button only a icon or a button is a link:if you add border:none !important;then the button will become smaller size when clicked.Try this In Bootstrap 4 they use

box-shadow: 0 0 0 0px rgba(0,123,255,0); on :focus, si i solved my problem with You need to use proper nesting and then apply styles to it. I found this quite useful in my case after the button click.I opted to simply remove the border width on :focus. This removes the ugly space between the outline and the button's rounded corners. For some reason this issue only happens on actual button elements and not <a class="btn"> elements.This may help if someone still has this question unresolved.Here's my Boostrap 4 solution to remove the button outlineI just had the same issue and the following code worked for me:Hoping it will help!Actually in bootstrap is defined all variables for all cases. In your case you just have to override default variable '$input-btn-focus-box-shadow' from '_variables.scss' file. Like so: 

$input-btn-focus-box-shadow: none;

Note that you need to override that variable in your own custom '_yourCusomVarsFile.scss'. And that file should be import in project in first order and then bootstrap like so:The bootstraps vars goes with flag '!default'.So in your file, you will override default values.

Here the illustration: The very first var have more priority then second one. The same is for the rest states and cases.

Hope it will help you.Here is '_variable.scss' file from repo, where you can find all initials values from bootstrap: https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/blob/v4-dev/scss/_variables.scssChears this works for me on BS3This one worked for me in Bootstrap 4: .btn {border-color: transparent;}TryKeep in mind, if you're button is inside of an anchor like:Adding the style to the button itself may not be enough, you may need to add the a:focus, a:active { outline: none } CSS rules where appropriate (this worked for me).Try the belowSometimes {outline: 0} didn't solve the problem and we can try {box-shadow: none;}I'm using bootstrap 4, you can use outline and box-shadow.Or if the button is inside an element like a div without back-ground, box-shadow is enough.Example: https://codepen.io/techednelson/pen/XRwgRBIf you are using version 4.3 or higher, your code will not work properly.

This is what I used. It worked for me.Instead to target on button class (.btn), here I target to button element itself and it works for me.And can use shadow-none class for input fieldEven after removing the outline from the button by setting its value to 0, There is still a funny behaviour on the button when clicked, its size shrinks a bit. So i came up with an optimal solution:Hope this helps...Here's a non-CSS method. Using JQuery, simply remove the "focus" class whenever the element is has been clicked.$(".btn").mousemove(function(element) {

    $(this).removeClass("focus");

});This method may cause the border to flash into existence and then back out briefly, which doesn't look bad in my opinion (it looks like part of the response when the button is clicked).The reason I used .mousemove() is that .click() and .mouseup() both proved to be ineffective.Changing these values worked for me. I found it by looking at the Developer Tools of ChromeThis retains the shadow of the button too, it only changes the color of the button on-click.Override the exact bootstrap statements:Change the Border Color back to Grey very simple :

This seems like a trivial problem, but I can't figure it out.On Bootstraps own website they have the Select example. 

Looking at the code it looks like there's a border-radius of 4 on that select element. 

My hope would be that changing that border-radius to 0 would then remove the border-radius from the select element, however, that's not the case - as seen in the picture below.

I've explored all the CSS that is changing that select element but none of it seems to remove the border radius.

I've explored all the CSS that is changing that select element but none of it seems to remove the border radius.Here is a version that works in all modern browsers. The key is using appearance:none which removes the default formatting. Since all of the formatting is gone, you have to add back in the arrow that visually differentiates the select from the input. Note: appearance is not supported in IE.Working example: https://jsfiddle.net/gs2q1c7p/Based on Arno Tenkink's suggestion in the comments, here is an example that uses a svg instead of a png for the arrow icon.In addition to border-radius: 0, add -webkit-appearance: none;.I had the same issue and while user1732055's answer fixes the border, it removes the dropdown arrows.  I solved this by removing the border from the select element and creating a wrapper span which has a border.html:css:https://jsfiddle.net/Lrqh0drd/6/You can use -webkit-border-radius: 0;. Like this:-This will give square corners as well as dropdown arrows. Using -webkit-appearance: none; is not recommended as it will turn off all the styling done by Chrome.Using the SVG from @ArnoTenkink as an data url combined with the accepted answer, this gives us the perfect solution for retina displays.the class is called:be sure to insert the override after including bootstraps css.

I'm using a radial gradient as the background on my webpage, like so:It works, but when the content does not fill the whole page the gradient is cut off. How can I make the <body> element fill the entire page, always?On our site we have pages where the content is static, and pages where it is loaded in with AJAX. On one page (a search page), there were cases when the AJAX results would more than fill the page, and cases where it would return no results. In order for the background image to fill the page in all cases we had to apply the following CSS:height for the html and min-height for the body.As none of the other answers worked for me, I decided to post this as an answer for others looking for a solution who also found the same problem. Both the html and body needed to be set with min-height or the gradient would not fill the body height.I found Stephen P's comment to provide the correct answer to this.When I have the html (or the html and body) height set to 100%,I had to apply 100% to both html and body.Try using viewport (vh, vm) units of measure at the body levelhtml, body { margin: 0; padding: 0; }

body { min-height: 100vh; }Use vh units for horizontal margins, paddings, and borders on the body and subtract them from the min-height value.I've had bizarre results using vh,vm units on elements within the body, especially when re-sizing.I think the largely correct way, is to set css to this:I tried all the solutions above and I'm not discrediting any of them, but in my case, they didn't work.For me, the problem was caused because the <header> tag had a margin-top of 5em and the <footer> had a margin-bottom of 5em. I removed them and instead put some padding (top and bottom, respectively). I'm not sure if replacing the margin was an ideal fix to the problem, but the point is that, if the first and last elements in your <body> has some margins, you might want to look into it and remove them.My html and body tags had the following stylesIf you have a border or padding, then the solutionproduces the imperfect renderingTo get it right in the presence of a border or paddinguse insteadas Martin pointed out, although overflow: hidden is not needed.(2018 - tested with Chrome 69 and IE 11)This works for me:

I'm looking for a way to change the CSS rules for pseudo-class selectors (such as :link, :hover, etc.) from JavaScript.So an analogue of the CSS code: a:hover { color: red } in JS.I couldn't find the answer anywhere else; if anyone knows that this is something browsers do not support, that would be a helpful result as well.You can't style a pseudo-class on a particular element alone, in the same way that you can't have a pseudo-class in an inline style="..." attribute (as there is no selector).You can do it by altering the stylesheet, for example by adding the rule:assuming each element you want to affect has a unique ID to allow it to be selected.In theory the document you want is http://www.w3.org/TR/DOM-Level-2-Style/Overview.html which means you can (given a pre-existing embedded or linked stylesheet) using syntax like:IE, of course, requires its own syntax:Older and minor browsers are likely not to support either syntax. Dynamic stylesheet-fiddling is rarely done because it's quite annoying to get right, rarely needed, and historically troublesome.I threw together a small library for this since I do think there are valid use cases for manipulating stylesheets in JS. Reasons being:A function to cope with the cross-browser stuff:My trick is using an attribute selector. Attributes are easier to set up by javascript. cssjavascripthtmlJust place the css in a template string.Then create a style element and place the string in the style tag and attach it to the document.Specificity will take care of the rest. Then you can remove and add style tags dynamically. This is a simple alternative to libraries and messing with the stylesheet array in the DOM. Happy Coding!There is another alternative.  Instead of manipulating the pseudo-classes directly, create real classes that model the same things, like a "hover" class or a "visited" class.  Style the classes with the usual "." syntax and then you can use JavaScript to add or remove classes from an element when the appropriate event fires.Instead of directly setting pseudo-class rules with javascript, you can set the rules differently in different CSS files, and then use Javascript to switch one stylesheet off and to switch another on. A method is described at A List Apart (qv. for more detail).Set up the CSS files as,And then switch between them using javascript:As already stated this is not something that browsers support.If you aren't coming up with the styles dynamically (i.e. pulling them out of a database or something) you should be able to work around this by adding a class to the body of the page.The css would look something like:And the javascript to change this would be something like:Switching stylesheets in and out is the way to do it.

Is there a way for a web developer to turn off Chrome/Safari/WebKit's spellchecking on particular input or textarea elements? I mean either by special tag attribute or a proprietary CSS instruction.There is a CSS instruction for turning off outlining of inputs so I thought that might also exist. I know how a user can do it.Or, as a user, can I disable it for some particular domain?

With jQuery ?Check the premailer.dialect.ca online converter or this Python script to do it.Here is a list of web based ready to use inlining tools, a couple have been mentioned previously. If there are any I've missed, feel free to edit and add them. I can't promise each works as advertised, so drop comments, but don't shoot the messenger...And here is one that works in reverse (un-inlining your css)If you'd like to have a PHP solution, you can try CssToInlineStyles.Two C# variants:http://chrispebble.com/Blog/7/inlining-a-css-stylesheet-with-cPreMailer.Net - https://github.com/milkshakesoftware/PreMailer.NetHaven't tested either as of yet but will post back if/when I do.I wrote a Node.js library called Styliner that inlines CSS in server-side Javascript.It supports LESS stylesheets as well (and supports plugins for other formats)You might want to take a look at PostageApp.One of its really strong features is that it has a very robust templating system that can automatically inline HTML and CSS without any issues.(Full Disclosure: I am the Product Manager for PostageApp.)This may be a little too late, but if you want to make your HTML the best possible for e-mail marketing (by inlining your css, and using a bunch of other cool tools), use the Premailer. Its free, and of course, made in partnership with CampaignMonitor itself.Hope it helps.It's not enough to simply inline your CSS. There are no observed standards as to how an HTML email will be shown in whatever email client is used. They all do it differently, and the more you design your email the more likely it is that it will break in a greater amount of clients. Many professionals in this space simply use images and tables and maybe some background colors, but nothing else. Always include a link to a website that has a working copy of the email and always provide a plain text variant.I'm a little late to the game but hopefully this will help someone.I found this nice little jQuery/javascript method that can be embedded into a page - http://devintorr.es/blog/2010/05/26/turn-css-rules-into-inline-style-attributes-using-jquery/I've edited it a little to support IE and also to support a page with multiple CSS files attached applying styles in the correct order.The page can then be copy/pasted into the email body.A javascript solution by tikku here :

What's the best way to get that sub-element?Update: I ended up using Mechanize for PHP which was much easier to work with.Update: Xpath version of *[@class~='my-class'] css selectorSo after my comment below in response to hakre's comment, I got curious and looked into the code behind Zend_Dom_Query. It looks like the above selector is compiled to the following xpath (untested):[contains(concat(' ', normalize-space(@class), ' '), ' my-class ')]so the php would be:Basically, all we do here is normalize the class attribute so that even a single class is bounded by spaces, and the complete class list is bounded in spaces. Then append the class we are searching for with a space. This way we are effectively looking for and find only instances of my-class.Use an xpath selector?If it is only ever one type of element you can replace the * with the particular tagname.If you need to do alot of this with very complex selector i would recommend Zend_Dom_Query which supports CSS selector syntax (a la jQuery):If you wish to get the innerhtml of the class without the zend you could use this:I think the accepted way is better, but I guess this might work as wellThere is also another approach without the use of DomXPath or Zend_Dom_Query.Based on dav's original function, I wrote the following function that returns all the children of the parent node whose tag and class match the parameters.suppose you have a variable $html the following HTML:use of getElementsByClass is as simple as:DOMDocument is slow to type and phpQuery has bad memory leak issues.

What's the point using this syntaxWhat's the difference between thisA > B will only select B that are direct children to A (that is, there are no other elements inbetween).A B will select any B that are inside A, even if there are other elements between them.> is the child selector. It specifies only immediate child elements and not any descendant (including grandchildren, grand-grandchildren etc.) as in the second example without the >.The child selector is not supported by IE 6 and lower. A great compatibility table is here. div.card > div.name matches <div class='card'>....<div class='name'>xxx</div>...</div>

but it doesn't match <div class='card'>....<div class='foo'> ... <div class='name'>xxx</div>..</div>....</div>div.card div.name matches both.That is, the > selector makes sure that the selected element on the right side

of the > is an immidiate child of the element on its left side.The syntax without the > matches any <div class='name'> that is a descendant (not only a child) of <div class='card'>.A > B selects B if it's a direct children of A, whereas  A B selects B whether it is a direct children of B or not.Consider the two scenarios div > span { } vs. div span { }Here, the <space> selects all the all the <span> elements of <div> element even if they are inside another element. The > selects all the children of <div> element but if they are inside another element.This one just selects the <span>World!</span> and it won't look for the <span> inside <p> tag.This one selects all the span tags, even if they are nested inside another tag.

Why does CSS not support negative padding?

[Why does CSS not support negative padding?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4973988/why-does-css-not-support-negative-padding)

I have seen this many a times that the prospect of a negative padding might help the development of CSS of certain page elements become better and easier. Yet, there is no provision for a negative padding in the W3C CSS. What is the reason behind this? Is there any obstruction to the property that prevents it's use as such? Thanks for your answers.UPDATE

As I see, for example, in case you are using a font that has something, say, a 20px of vertical spacing, and you wish to apply a dashed border to the bottom of the font, say when a hyperlink appears. In such cases you'll find the style to be way too shabby, as the dashed border will appear 20px below the specified word. if you use negative margin, it's not going to work, as margin alters the area outside borders. Negative padding might help in such situations.

Negative padding might help in such situations.I recently answered a different question where I discussed why the box model is the way it is.There are specific reasons for each part of the box model. Padding is meant to extend the background beyond its contents. If you need to shrink the background of the container, you should make the parent container the correct size and give the child element some negative margins. In this case the content is not being padded, it's overflowing.Padding by definition is a positive integer (including 0).Negative padding would cause the border to collapse into the content (see the box-model page on w3) - this would make the content area smaller than the content, which doesn't make sense.I would like to describe a very good example of why negative padding would be useful and awesome.As all of us CSS developers know, vertically aligning a dynamically sizing div within another is a hassle, and for the most part, viewed as being impossible only using CSS. The incorporation of negative padding could change this.Please review the following HTML:With the following CSS, we would be able to vertically center the content of the inner div within the outer div:Allow me to explain...Absolutely positioning the inner div's top at 50% places the top edge of the inner div at the center of the outer div. Pretty simple. This is because percentage based positioning is relative to the inner dimensions of the parent element.Percentage based padding, on the other hand, is based on the inner dimensions of the targeted element. So, by applying the property of padding-top: -50%; we have shifted the content of the inner div upward by a distance of 50% of the height of the inner div's content, therefore centering the inner div's content within the outer div and still allowing the height dimension of the inner div to be dynamic!If you ask me OP, this would be the best use-case, and I think it should be implemented just so I can do this hack. lol. Or, they should just fix the functionality of vertical-align and give us a version of vertical-align that works on all elements.This could help, by the way:The box-sizing CSS property is used to alter the default CSS box model used to calculate widths and heights of elements.http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-ui/#box-sizing 

https://developer.mozilla.org/En/CSS/Box-sizingYou asked WHY, not how to cheat it:Usually because of laziness of programmers of the initial implementation, because they HAVE already put way more effort in other features, delivering more odd side-effects like floats, because they were more requested by designers back then and yet they haven't taken the time to allow this so we can use the FOUR properties to push/pull an element against its neighbors (now we only have four to push, and only 2 to pull).When html was designed, magazines loved text reflown around images back then, now hated because today we have touch trends, and love squary things with lots of space and nothing to read. That's why they put more pressure on floats than on centering, or they could have designed something like margin-top: fill; or margin: average 0; to simply align the content to the bottom, or distribute its extra space around.In this case I think it hasn't been implemented because of the same reason that makes CSS to lack of a :parent pseudo-selector: To prevent looping evaluations.Without being an engineer, I can see that CSS right now is made to paint elements once, remember some properties for future elements to be painted, but NEVER going back to already-painted elements.That's why (I guess) padding is calculated on the width, because that's the value that was available at the time of starting to paint it.If you had a negative value for padding, it would affect the outer limits, which has ALREADY been defined when the margin has already been set. I know, nothing has been painted yet, but when you read how the painting process goes, created by geniuses with 90's technology, I feel like I am asking dumb questions and just say "thanks" hehe.One of the requirements of web pages is that they are quickly available, unlike an app that can take its time and eat the computer resources to get everything correct before displaying it, web pages need to use little resources (so they are fit in every device possible) and be scrolled in a breeze.If you see applications with complex reflowing and positioning, like InDesign, you can't scroll that fast! It takes a big effort both from processors and graphic card to jump to next pages!So painting and calculating forward and forgetting about an element once drawn, for now it seems to be a MUST.Fitting an Iframe inside containers will not match the size of the container.  It adds about 20px of padding.  Currently there is no easy way to fix this.  You need javascript (http://css-tricks.com/snippets/jquery/fit-iframe-to-content/)Negative margins would be an easy solution.Because the designers of CSS didn't have the foresight to imagine the flexibility this would bring. There are plenty of reasons to expand the content area of a box without affecting its relationship to neighbouring elements. If you think it's not possible, put some long nowrap'd text in a box, set a width on the box, and watch how the overflowed content does nothing to the layout.Yes, this is still relevant with CSS3 in 2019; case in point: flexbox layouts. Flexbox items' margins do not collapse, so in order to space them evenly and align them with the visual edge of the container, one must subtract the items' margins from their container's padding. If any result is < 0, you must use a negative margin on the container, or sum that negative with the existing margin. I.e. the content of the element effects how one defines the margins for it, which is backwards. Summing doesn't work cleanly when flex elements' content have margins defined in different units or are affected by a different font-size, etc.The example below should, ideally have aligned and evenly spaced grey boxes but, sadly they aren't.I have encountered enough of these little issues over the years where a little negative padding would have gone a long way, but instead I'm forced to add non-semantic markup, use calc(), or CSS preprocessors which only work when the units are the same, etc.

I have the image rotating and doing it continuously, but there seems to be a delay after the animation has finished before it does the next rotation.I have tried changing the animation duration but it makes no difference, if you slow it right down say 5s its just more apparent that after the first rotation there is a pause before it rotates again.

It's this pause I want to get rid of.Any help is much appreciated, thanks.Your issue here is that you've supplied a -webkit-TRANSITION-timing-function when you want a -webkit-ANIMATION-timing-function.  Your values of 0 to 360 will work properly.  You also might notice a little lag because 0deg and 360deg are the same spot, so it is going from spot 1 in a circle back to spot 1. It is really insignificant, but to fix it, all you have to do is change 360deg to 359degmy jsfiddle illustrates your animation: Also what might be more resemblant of the apple loading icon would be an animation that transitions the opacity/color of the stripes of gray instead of rotating the icon.You could use animation like this:If you're only looking for a webkit version this is nifty: http://s3.amazonaws.com/37assets/svn/463-single_spinner.html from http://37signals.com/svn/posts/2577-loading-spinner-animation-using-css-and-webkitYour code seems correct. I would presume it is something to do with the fact you are using a .png and the way the browser redraws the object upon rotation is inefficient, causing the hang (what browser are you testing under?)If possible replace the .png with something native.see; http://kilianvalkhof.com/2010/css-xhtml/css3-loading-spinners-without-images/Chrome gives me no pauses using this method.I made a small library that lets you easily use a throbber without images.It uses CSS3 but falls back onto JavaScript if the browser doesn't support it.Example.

If not, why were these new units introduced to CSS3?100% can be 100% of the height of anything. For example, if I have a parent div that's 1000px tall, and a child div that is at 100% height, then that child div could theoretically be much taller than the height of the viewport, or much smaller than the height of the viewport, even though that div is set at 100% height.If I instead make that child div set at 100vh, then it'll only fill up 100% of the height of the viewport, and not necessarily the parent div.I know the question is very old and @Josh Beam addressed the biggest difference, but there's still another one:Suppose you have a <div>, direct child of <body> that you want filling the whole viewport, so you use width: 100vw; height: 100vh;. It all works just the same as width: 100%; height: 100vh; until you add more content and a vertical scrollbar shows up. Since the vw account for the scrollbar as part of the viewport, width: 100vw; will be slightly bigger than width: 100%;. This little difference ends up adding a horizontal scrollbar (required for the user to see that little extra width) and by consequence, the height would also be a little different on both cases.That must be taken into consideration when deciding which one to use, even if the parent element size is the same as the document viewport size.Example:Using width:100vw;:Using width:100%;:the vw (view-width) and vh (view-height) units are relational to the view-port size, where 100vw or vh is 100% of the view-port's width/height. For example, 

if a view-port is 1600px wide, and you specify something as being 2vw, that will be the equivalent of 2% of the view-port width, or 32px.% unit is always based on the parent element width of the current elementThank you for your answer and code example, @IanC.  It helped me a lot.  A clarification:  I believe you meant "scrollbar" when you wrote "sidebar."  Here are some related discussions about viewport units counting scrollbars that I also found helpful:The W3C spec for the vw, vh, vmin, vmax units (the "viewport percentage lengths") says "any scrollbars are assumed not to exist".Apparently Firefox subtracts scrollbar width from 100vw, as @Nolonar's comment at Difference between Width:100% and width:100vw? observes, citing "Can I Use". Can I Use, perhaps in tension with the spec (?), says all browsers other than Firefox currently "incorrectly" consider 100vw to be the entire page width including the vertical scroll bar.There is a difference that has not necessarily been raised. 100vw includes the width of the scrool bar, while 100% does not include it. It is a small difference, but important when doing design.

This will place the child content at the bottom of the parent element, assuming the parent element has a height greater than the child element.There is no need to try and calculate a value for margin-top when you have a height on your parent element or another element greater than your child element of interest within your parent element.Based on the other answers here is an even more responsive version. I made changes from Ivan's version to support viewports <768px wide and to better support slow window resizes.This is based on cfx's solution, but rather than setting the font size to zero in the parent container to remove the inter-column spaces added because of the display: inline-block and having to reset them, I simply added to the column divs to compensate.Well, I didn't like any of those answers, my solution of the same problem was to add this:<div>&nbsp;</div>.
