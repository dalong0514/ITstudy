In the following code, align-self works with flex-wrap: nowrap.But when the container is switched to flex-wrap: wrap, the align-self property fails.Similarly, why does align-items work here (wrap disabled):...but not here (wrap enabled):With flex-wrap: nowrap, the align-content property will not vertically center flex items here:But then, strangely, if wrap is enabled and align-content is left out, the container creates wide gaps between rows here:And align-self works again.Although the flex-wrap property seems pretty basic – it controls whether flex items can wrap – it actually has a wide-ranging impact on the entire flexbox layout.The flex-wrap property determines the type of flex container you will use.The align-items and align-self properties work in both single- and multi-line containers. However, they can only have an effect when there's free space in the cross axis of the flex line.The align-content property works only in multi-line containers. It is ignored in single-line containers.The flexbox specification provides four keyword properties for aligning flex items:To understand the functions of these properties it's important to first understand the structure of a flex container.The X and Y AxesA flex container works in two directions: x-axis (horizontal) and y-axis (vertical).                                                                                                                Source: WikipediaThe child elements of a flex container – known as "flex items" – can be aligned in either direction.This is flex alignment at its most fundamental level.The Main and Cross AxesOverlaying the x and y axes are, in flex layout, the main and cross axes.By default, the main axis is horizontal (x-axis), and the cross axis is vertical (y-axis). That's the initial setting, as defined by the flexbox specification.                                                                                                                Source: W3CHowever, unlike the x and y axes, which are fixed, the main and cross axes can switch directions.The flex-direction PropertyIn the image above, the main axis is horizontal and the cross axis is vertical. As mentioned earlier, that's an initial setting of a flex container.However, these directions can be easily switched with the flex-direction property. This property controls the direction of the main axis; it determines whether flex items align vertically or horizontally.From the spec:There are four values for the flex-direction property:The cross axis is always perpendicular to the main axis.Within the container, flex items exist in a line, known as a "flex line".A flex line is a row or column, depending on flex-direction.A container can have one or more lines, depending on flex-wrap. Single-Line Flex Containerflex-wrap: nowrap establishes a single-line flex container, in which flex items are forced to stay in a single line (even if they overflow the container).The image above has one flex line.Multi-Line Flex Containerflex-wrap: wrap or wrap-reverse establishes a multi-line flex container, in which flex items can create new lines.The image above has three flex lines.The image above has three flex lines.Properties are Assigned to the Main and Cross (not X and Y) AxesWhile the flex-direction property controls the direction in which flex items are laid out, there are four properties that control alignment and positioning. These are:Each one of these properties is permanently assigned to an axis.The justify-content property works only in the main axis.The three align-* properties work only in the cross axis.It's a common mistake to assume that these properties are fixed to the x and y axes. For example, justify-content is always horizontal, and align-items is always vertical.However, when flex-direction is switched to column, the main axis becomes the y-axis, and justify-content works vertically.The focus of this post is cross-axis alignment. For an explanation of main-axis alignment and the justify-content property, see this post:DefinitionsThe flexbox specification provides three keyword properties for cross-axis alignment:The align-items property aligns flex items along the cross axis of the flex line. It applies to flex containers.The align-self property is used to override align-items on individual flex items. It applies to flex items.Here's the definition from the spec:There are six possible values for align-items / align-self:(For a description of each value, click on the spec definition heading above.)The initial value of align-items is stretch, meaning flex items will expand the full available length of the container's cross axis.The initial value of align-self is auto, meaning it inherits the value of align-items. Below is an illustration of the effect of each value in a row-direction container.                                                                                                                source: W3CThis property is slightly more complex than align-items and align-self. Here's the definition from the spec:In contrast to align-items and align-self, which move flex items within their line, align-content moves flex lines within the container.There are the six possible values for align-content:(For a description of each value, click on the spec definition heading above.)Below is an illustration of the effect of each value in a row-direction container.                                                                                                                source: W3CWhy does align-content work only in multi-line flex containers?In a single-line flex container, the cross size of the line is equal to the cross size of the container. This means there is no free space between the line and the container. As a result, align-content can have no effect.Here's the relevant section from the spec:In Example #1, align-self works with flex-wrap: nowrap because the flex items exist in a single-line container. Therefore, there is one flex line and it matches the height of the container.In Example #2, align-self fails because it exists in a multi-line container (flex-wrap: wrap) and align-content is set to flex-start. This means that flex lines are packed tightly to the start of the cross axis, leaving no free space for align-self to work.The explanation for Example #3 is the same as for Example #1.The explanation for Example #4 is the same as for Example #2.Example #5 is a single-line container. As such, the cross size of the flex line equals the cross size of the container, leaving no extra space between the two. Therefore, align-content, which aligns flex lines when there is extra space in the cross axis, is having no effect.The initial setting for align-content is stretch. This means that if no other value is specified, the container will distribute available space evenly among flex lines. (A similar effect is created on the main axis when all flex items get flex: 1.)This distribution of space among lines can cause wide gaps between rows / columns. Less lines result in wider gaps. More lines result in smaller gaps, as each line gets a smaller share of the space. To resolve this problem switch from align-content: stretch to align-content: flex-start. This packs the lines together (see examples #2 and #4 above). Of course, this also eliminates any free space in the line, and align-items and align-self can no longer work.Here's a related post: Remove space (gaps) between multiple lines of flex items when they wrapAs explained in previous examples, with align-content: stretch, there can be extra space in the flex lines, which allows align-items and align-self to work. Any other value for align-content would pack the lines, eliminating  extra space, and making align-items and align-self useless.First of all, align-content is useless if there is no wrap:w3c docAlso, in your second case, align-self is not failing. It's useless because the inner lines have been packed. Let's create an space so that the style can work:Similarly, in your 4th example, the style is working, if you set the conditions where it can be seenFinally, when you comment the align-content, it reverts to stretch, that's why the lines increase the size to fill up the container

It only works in webkit browsers but has a fallback for the other ones.use :along with:Here is the fiddle: demoI'm posting this because I believe my solution is less complex than the popular one, which involves pseudo elements and float behaviour. I recently had to create a solution which would work in IE7, so pseudo elements weren't an option in the first place.The technique involves 4 elements:As with previous CSS-only solutions, the technique demands a solid colour background or fixed position background image for the contents: the ellipsis needs to obscure parts of the text, and the fill needs to obscure the ellipsis. You can do a fancy gradient effect to make the text fade into the ellipsis, but I'll leave that cosmetic detail to discretion.Here's a fiddle demonstrating it: resize your browser's width or change the text to see it shift from ellipsis to no-ellipsis.Aside from the arbitrary elegance factor, I believe this is more performant than the popular solution because it doesn't rely on floats (which require a lot of repainting) — absolute positioning is much simpler to compute since there are no inter-dependencies when calculating layout.I wrote a javascript function to fix the multiline ellipsis problemhope this helps!I found a solution for multi-line cross-browser pure CSS ellipsis. I tried lots of solutions and only this one worked out only using CSS. I had a div with a dynamic width and had to set the height.

Browsers, being diligent about attempting to render what the author wants rather than what the author wrote have respected <style> elements in the <body> despite those pages technically being invalid.The <style> element continued to be invalid in the <body>In some working drafts of the HTML5.1 spec the <style> element was to allow for a [scoped] attribute, which would allow the <style> element to be used in flow content (i.e. in the <body>).As an example of how that could have been used would be:Support for the scoped feature was added to Firefox in version 21 and added in Chrome behind a flag in version 20. The feature didn't receive enough support, so it was later removed from the HTML5.1 working draft.Chrome was first to remove the feature in version 36. Firefox has since set the feature to be behind a flag in version 55.In the July 2017 working draft of the HTML5.2 spec, support was added for the <style> element to be allowed in flow content:Emphasis mineAt the time of writing this addition has remained in the HTML5.2 spec, which is currently at the Candidate Recommendation maturity level.While this makes using <style> elements in the <body> still somewhat of a risk, this particular change is standardizing something that browsers have supported for many years.There is no standard way (EDIT: as of HTML5 there apparently is!) of adding a <style> element outside of the <head> tag - it is only allowed there and NOT within the <body> tag (See the DTD here).If you want to style your HTML fragments individually and not use CSS styles in your head, you will need to resort to inline styling. However: Most browsers understand <style> tags within the body, so you may as well use them, but your page won't be standards compliant.In any way:From what I understand you use some kind of templating, where you insert different HTML snippets into the page with different designs. Is it so bad if you put all styles within one big CSS file? Would it be impossible for you to dynamically load a another CSS file (via JS or server side scripting), when your HTML fragment gets inserted in the page (this would be the preferred method)?I've found two hacks to do that. Both of which should be perfectly valid html.Wrap your <style /> element inside a <svg /> element.Format your css as a data uri and use that in a <link /> element.

This means that a line of text must not be cut in half in the top or bottom border of the screen.EditThis question was originally tagged "Android" as my intent is to build an Android ePub reader. However, it appears that the solution can be implemented just with JavaScript and CSS so I broadened the scope of the question to make it platform-independent.Building on Dan's answer here is my solution for this problem, with which I was struggling myself until just now. (this JS works on iOS Webkit, no guarantees for android, but please let me know the results)Hope this helps...Speaking from experience, expect to put a lot of time into this, even for a barebones viewer. An ePub reader was actually first big project I took on when I started learning C#, but the ePub standard is definitely pretty complex.You can find the latest version of the spec for ePub here:

http://www.idpf.org/specs.htm

which includes the OPS (Open Publication Structure), OPF (Open Packaging Format), and OCF (OEBPS Container Format).Also, if it helps you at all, here is a link to the C# source code of the project I started on:https://www.dropbox.com/sh/50kxcr29831t854/MDITIklW3I/ePub%20Test.zipIt's not fleshed out at all; I haven't played with this for months, but if I remember correctly, just stick an ePub in the debug directory, and when you run the program just type some part of the name (e.g. Under the Dome, just type "dome") and it will display the details of the book. I had it working correctly for a few books, but any eBooks from Google Books broke it completely. They have a completely bizarre implementation of ePub (to me, at least) compared to books from other sources. Anyway, hopefully some of the structural code in there might help you out!I've had to code something like this too, and my (working) solution is this:You have to apply these lines to the webview...Also, you have to inject some javascript. I've had tons of problems with the differents scales of my activity and the content rendered in the webview, so my solution doesn't take any kind of value from "outside".[...]Enjoy :)I recently attempted something similar to this and added some CSS styling to change the layout to horizontal instead of vertical. This gave me the desired effect without having to modify the content of the Epub in any way.This code should work.So, basically you're injecting JavaScript to change the styling of the body element after the chapter has been loaded (very important). The only downfall to this approach is when you have images in the content the calculated column count goes askew. It shouldn't be too hard to fix though. My attempt was going to be injecting some JavaScript to add width and height attributes to all images in the DOM that don't have any.Hope it helps.-DanMaybe it would work to use XSL-FO. This seems heavy for a mobile device, and maybe it's overkill, but it should work, and you wouldn't have to implement the complexities of good pagination (e.g. how do you make sure that each screen doesn't cut text in half) yourself.The basic idea would be:I don't know whether there is an XSL-FO processor available for Android. You could try Apache FOP. RenderX (XSL-FO processor) has the advantage of having a paged-HTML output option, but again I don't know if it could run on Android.There is several ways this could be done. If every line is in its own element all you have to do is to check if one of it's edges goes outside of the view (either the browsers, or the "book page").If you want to know how many "pages" there is going to be in advance, just temporary move them into the view and get what line a page ends. This could potentially be slow because of that page reflow is needed for the browser to know where anything is.Otherwise I think that you could use the HTML5 canvas element to measure text and / or draw text.Some info on that here:

I am creating a popupwindow and I want to add a css file to that popupwindow below is the code for popupwindow. I have a javascript with creates a popupwindow. Now I want to add a css file to this popupwindow. I tried something like but doesnt work.Thanks This should work.This is how I add css using jQuery ajax.  Hope it helps someone..Just my couple cents... sometimes it's good to be sure there are no any duplicates... so we have the next function in the utils library:How to use:Your issue is that your selector is for an anchor element <a>. You are treating the <a> tag as if it represents the page which is not the case. $('head') will work as long as this selector is being executed by the page that needs the css.Why not simply add the css file to the page in question. Any particular reason to attempt this dynamically from another page? I am not even familiar with a way to inject css to remote pages like this ... seems like it would be a major security hole.ADDENDUM to your reasoning: Then you should simply pass a parameter to the page, read it using javascript, and then do whatever is needed based on the parameter.Try doing it the other way around.I don't think you can attach down into a window that you are instancing... I KNOW you can't do it if the url's are on different domains (XSS and all that jazz), but you can talk UP from that window and access elements of the parent window assuming they are on the same domain. your best bet is to attach the stylesheet at the page you are loading, and if that page isn't on the same domain, (e.g. trying to restyle some one else's page,) you won't be able to.Have you tried simply using the media attribute for you css reference?Or set it to screen if you don't want the printed version to use the style:This way you don't need to add it dynamically.

I'm talking about that black nav-bar on top.Here is simplest way how to change navbar color after window scroll:Add follow JS to head:and this CSS codeBackground color of fixed navbar will be change to white when scroll exceeds height of navbar.See follow JsFiddleHere is a jsfiddle example. Using Jquery to change the background color based on scroll pixel position. Here is a fiddle using bootstrapthis is a simple pure javascript in some chrome versions there is bug with:so you may add a condition like this:sure you must have 2 classesThis can be done using jQuery.Here is a link to a fiddle.When the window scrolls, the distance between the top of the window and the height of the window is compared. When the if statement is true, the background color is set to transparent. And when you scroll back to the top the color comes back to white.best approach to use event listener. especially for Firefox browser, check this doc Scroll-linked effects and Firefox is no longer support document.body.scrollTop and alternative to use document.documentElement.scrollTop. This is completes the answer from Yahya Essam Today I've gone through the same question, how to change navbar background-color as scrolling. And I was seeking for a solution using CSS only, no jquery, no bootstrap nor javascript. But then it turned out couldn't be done with CSS only yet (as of today Dec 2019). And have to choose, I'll stick with the core technology - javascript instead of jquery or bootstrap unless it's far more complicated using js than the others. But luckily it's not.Here's the code:

- It uses onscroll/ scroll event of window to trigger the event listener.

- In the event listener, use pageYOffset/ scrollY of window to check the scroll status.Browser support are seemingly the same between both:

- https://caniuse.com/#search=scrollY

Slight variation to the above answers, but with Vanilla JS:I use WordPress which comes with Underscore. So when you register your theme scripts, you would use 'jquery' and 'underscore' as the handle for the array of the dependancies.

Something like:you can use string interpolation:you can install this package https://github.com/JedWatson/classnamesand then use it like thisTo have multiple classes applied to a component, wrap the classes you would like to apply within classNames. For example, in your situation, your code should look like this,Make sure that you import classNames!!!Have a look at material ui documentation where they use multiple classes in one component to create a customized buttonYou can also use the extend property (the jss-extend plugin is enabled by default):You could use clsx. I noticed it used in the MUI buttons examplesFirst install it:npm install --save clsxThen import it in your component file:import clsx from  'clsx';Then use the imported function in your component:<div className={ clsx(classes.container, classes.spacious)}>I think this will solve your problem:and in react component: Yes, jss-composes provides you this:And then you just use classes.spacious.If you want to assign multiple class names to your element, you can use arrays.So in your code above, if this.props.classes resolves to something like ['container', 'spacious'], i.e. if you can simply assign it to div asand result will beAs already mentioned, you can use string interpolation And you can try classnames library,

You're not changing your CSS document with that function and thus adding and removing and adding the class have no effect since it hasn't been modified at all!You should use the same function but set the background color to black this time.Or simply remove the style attributeI know this is old, but you can just set the value to an empty string to remove your custom style like so:What about toggleClass("testThing")? I use it when there's more than one property to change.http://api.jquery.com/toggleClass/It is better to just add another class that overrides the style you want to change and then remove it. It beats hard coding style info inside the js.

The only issue is youll have to ensure the added class is of a higher order so that the element takes the style from it rather than the existing class but this is not hard to ensure.

Though it would help to see your CSS applied to these elements.NOTE. The example above doesn't work in IE7 though.I think floats may work best for you here, if you dont want the element to occupy the whole line, float it left should work. EDIT: now browsers have better support you can make use of the do inline-block.Depending on the text-align this will appear as through its inline while also acting like a block element.For the block element not occupy the whole line, set it's width to something small and the white-space:nowrap

How to use 3-digit color codes rather than 6-digit color codes in CSS?

[How to use 3-digit color codes rather than 6-digit color codes in CSS?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3108860/how-to-use-3-digit-color-codes-rather-than-6-digit-color-codes-in-css)

I recently went through my CSS file and switch all my 6-digit hexadecimal codes to simple 3-digit codes (for example, my #FDFEFF got shortened to #FFF). It renders pretty much the exact same color as before, it seems to me that the in between parts are fairly useless and removing them saved me an entire 300 bytes in my CSS file.Does it matter which version you use? I rarely ever run across websites that use only the 3-digit codes (or I guess I just never run across ones that do). Is it still perfectly valid to use 3-digit codes over 6-digit codes, or are we supposed to use the full 6-digit codes?

I rarely ever run across websites that use only the 3-digit codes (or I guess I just never run across ones that do). Is it still perfectly valid to use 3-digit codes over 6-digit codes, or are we supposed to use the full 6-digit codes?The 3-digit codes are shorthand, #123 is the same as #112233. In the example you give, you've (effectively) swapped #FDFEFF for #FFFFFF, which is close to the original colour but obviously not exact.It doesn't "matter" which version you use, as such, but 3-digit colour codes mean you have a little less choice in shades. If you feel that saving 300 bytes is worth that, then go ahead and use the 3-digit codes, but unless you're designing for a low-bandwidth situation those 300 bytes won't really save you all that much.Shorthand sucks! Don't use it. It's harder to maintain and creates unnecessary variation e.g. when searching and replacing a colour value ("oh, now I have to take into consideration #FFFFFF and white and #FFF"). What you save in size is never worth what you lose in maintainability. Use minifaction and compression to save bandwidth.If you want to save bytes then you better use CSS minification techniquesIf you use this in a table in IE 7 8 or 9 (unfortunately this is relevant as of the date of this response)http://www.w3schools.com/html/tryit.asp?filename=tryhtml_tables  6 digit codes work fine but 3 digit codes render as blackIf the "3 digit" versions produces the colour you need then you can use it as much as you like. It's certainly not wrong.I always use the shorthand. The best advantage is that I can easily remember the codes.You still have 163 = 4,096 colors to choose from, should be enough.However if you save 300 bytes in shorthand color codes it means you have 100 colors decleared in your CSS. Unless your page is very diverse, or all rainbows and flowers it seems like a lot. You might be good at systematic CSS, but I often see unneccesary css rules. EX: if you're setting the same rule to many child elements that could have been replaced with setting the rule on the grandparent and in one exception element instead.That is true, but this transformation is not general:So what it does is it "doubles" each hexadecimal digit. So it is not the same color. It is however possible that it looks the same because the differences are minute. A calibrated color workflow could help in this case.It does not matter whether you use shorthand or normal hex colours, so go ahead and convert them if you desire. Wow, a full 300 bytes! :D, sarcasm ftwThe thing is unless you're going to minify, compress and combine all of your css, javascript etc 300 bytes is barely worth bothering with, especially as the average internet speed is increasing.Have fun!It is not possible, please go through how the hexadecimal color code works.For few color codes we can reduce it to 3 digits, however, for the many hexadecimal color codes we cannot turn that down to 3 digits. Please check the below links for the further clarification.https://www.quackit.com/css/color/values/css_hex_color_notation_3_digits.cfm

It would be like this:It seems that Bootstrap doesn't support disabled links. Instead of trying to add a Bootstrap class, you could add a class by your own and add some styling to it, just like this: If what you're trying to do is disable an a link, there is no option to do this. I think you can find an answer that will work for you in this question here. One option here is to use Disabled href tagI just created my own version using CSS. As I need to disabled, then when document is ready use jQuery to make active. So that way a user cannot click on a button until after the document is ready. So i can substitute with AJAX instead. The way I came up with, was to add a class to the anchor tag itself and remove the class when document is ready. Could re-purpose this for your needs.CSS:HTML:JS:You cant set links to "disabled" just system elements like input, textfield etc.But you can disable links with jQuery/JavaScriptJust wrap the above code in whatever event you want to disable the links.

Preloading @font-face fonts?

[Preloading @font-face fonts?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1330825/preloading-font-face-fonts)

Is it possible to preload or otherwise cache @font-face fonts, most likely with javascript, before the page loads so you don't get that ugly jump when the page finally does load?

2009-08-25 20:35:48Z

Is it possible to preload or otherwise cache @font-face fonts, most likely with javascript, before the page loads so you don't get that ugly jump when the page finally does load?I'm not aware of any current technique to avoid the flicker as the font loads, however you can minimize it by sending proper cache headers for your font and making sure that that request goes through as quickly as possible.A simple technique is to put this somewhere in your index:Tested on Chrome 34, Safari 7 and FF 29 and IE 112017: You now have preloadCheck browser compatibility.It is most useful for font preloading (not waiting for the browser to find it in some CSS). You can also preload some logos, icons and scripts.Other techniques pro/cons are discussed here (not my blog).There are a few techniques for "preloading" here:

http://paulirish.com/2009/fighting-the-font-face-fout/Mostly tricking the browser into downloading the file as fast as possible..You can also deliver it as a data-uri, which helps a lot.

and also you could hide the page content and show it when its ready.Proper font pre-loading is a big hole in the HTML5 spec.

I've gone through all of this stuff and the most reliable solution I've found is to use Font.js:http://pomax.nihongoresources.com/pages/Font.js/You can use it to load fonts using the same API you use to load imagesIt's much simpler and more lightweight than Google's hulking Webfont LoaderHere's the github repo for Font.js:https://github.com/Pomax/Font.jsThis should solve your problem.To answer your initial question: yes you can. Only Gecko and WebKit browsers support it currently though.

You just need to add link tags in your head:Via Google's webfontloader i did this by adding some letter in my main document and made it transparent and assigned the font that I wanted to load.e.g.Use the standard CSS Font Loading API.Wait for (all) the fonts to load, and then show your content:Demo CodePen.Recently I was working on a game compatible with CocoonJS with DOM limited to the canvas element - here is my approach:Using fillText with a font that has not been loaded yet will execute properly but with no visual feedback - so the canvas plane will stay intact - all you have to do is periodically check the canvas for any changes (for example looping through getImageData searching for any non transparent pixel) that will happen when the font loads properly.I have explained this technique a little bit more in my recent article http://rezoner.net/preloading-font-face-using-canvas,686Google has a nice library for this: https://developers.google.com/webfonts/docs/webfont_loader

You can use almost any fonts and the lib will add classes to the html tag. It even gives you javascript events on when certrain fonts are loaded and active!Don't forget to serve your fontfiles gzipped! it will certainly speed things up!As I found the best way is doing is preloading a stylesheet that contains the font face, and then let browser to load it automatically. I used the font-face in other locations (in the html page), but then I could observe the font changing effect briefly. then in the font.css file, specify as following.You can't assign a name to fonts when it's preloaded through link tag (correct me if I was wrong I couldn't find a way yet), and thus you have to use font-face to assign the name to the font. Even though it's possible to load a font through link tag, it's not recommended as you can't assign a name to the font with it. Without a name as with font-face, you won't be able to use it anywhere in the web page. According to gtmetrix, style sheet loads at the beginning, then rest of the scripts/style by order, then the font before dom is loaded, and therefore you don't see font changing effect. Your head should include the preload rel as follows:This way woff2 will be preloaded by browsers that support preload, and all the fallback formats will load as they normally do.

And your css font face should look similar to to this

You've seen iterations of this type of progress bar on sites like paypal.  How does one go about setting this up using CSS and jquery? I have 4 pages and each page is a step... so 4 steps.I have searched for a solution that will visualize process steps in my web application. I have found the following excellent write-up by Stephen A Thomas:Tracking Progress in Pure CSS (Original Link now dead)In his approach Thomas even gets away with just using CSS - no Javascript! 

In an essence the following CSS code from his article does the trick for me:As well as HTML tags from his example (I use Grails GSP pages to generate tags and 'done/todo' class dynamically):Hope it helps. Works pretty well for me.UPDATE: The following (shortened) version also works well.display: table; table-layout: fixed; width: 100% ensure that the list items are automatically sized equally as long as the content does not overflow.  There is no need to use data-progtrckr-steps and its associated CSS.Here is how to make one:  http://24ways.org/2008/checking-out-progress-metersHere are some inspiration examples:  http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2010/01/15/progress-trackers-in-web-design-examples-and-best-design-practices/There are a lot of very nice answers on this page and I googled for some more, but none of the answers ticked all the checkboxes on my wish list:So I mixed the code of several examples, fixed the things that I needed and here is the result:I used the following CSS and HTML:As can be seen in the example above, there are now two list item classes to take note of: active and done. Use class="active" for the current step, use class="done" for all steps before it.Also note the data-steps="4" in the ol tag; set this to the total number of steps to apply the correct size to all list items.Feel free to play around with the JSFiddle. Enjoy!This is how I have achieved it using purely CSS and HTML (no JavaScript/images etc.).http://jsfiddle.net/tuPrn/It gracefully degrades in most browsers (I do need to add in a fix for lack of last-of-type in  < IE9).I had the same requirements to create a kind of step progress tracker so I created a JavaScript plugin for that purpose. Here is the JsFiddle for the demo for this step progress tracker. You can access its code on GitHub as well.What it basically does is, it takes the json data(in a particular format described below) as input and creates the progress tracker based on that. Highlighted steps indicates the completed steps.It's html will somewhat look like shown below with default CSS but you can customize it as per the theme of your application. There is an option to show tool-tip text for each steps as well. Here is some code snippet for that:Hopefully it will be useful for somebody else as well!This is what I did:HTMLCSSJavascript/jQueryWhat I would do is use the same trick often use for hovering on buttons.  Prepare an image that has 2 parts: (1) a top half which is greyed out, meaning incomplete, and (2) a bottom half which is colored in, meaning completed.  Use the same image 4 times to make up the 4 steps of the progress bar, and align top for incomplete steps, and align bottom for incomplete steps.In order to take advantage of image alignment, you'd have to use the image as the background for 4 divs, rather than using the img element.  This is the CSS for background image alignment:

Good Luck!I didnt know about css3pie.com, a very useful site after seeing this post: But what after testing it out it didnt work for me either.

So instead of:use this:I put mine in a folder called jquery, so mine was:So goto their downloads or get it here:http://css3pie.com/download-latestAnd use their PHP file.  Inside the PHP file it explains that some servers are not configured for proper .HTC usage.  And that was the problem I had.Try it! I did, it works.  Hope this helps others out too.http://fetchak.com/ie-css3/ works for IE 6+. Use this if css3pie doesn't work for you.PIE.htc worked for me great (http://css3pie.com/), but with one issue:You should write absolute path to PIE.htc. It hasn't worked for me when I used relative path.As Internet Explorer doesn't natively support rounded corners. 

So a better cross-browser way to handle it would be to use rounded-corner images at the corners. Many famous websites use this approach.You can also find rounded image generators around the web. One such link is http://www.generateit.net/rounded-corner/

I'm using @font-face to embed fonts in my website.

Is there a way to minimise/get rid of this delay, by delaying the page rendering until after fonts have loaded or similar.

I'm using @font-face to embed fonts in my website. First the text renders as the system default, and then (once the font file has loaded presumably) the correct font renders a fraction of a second later. Is there a way to minimise/get rid of this delay, by delaying the page rendering until after fonts have loaded or similar.This is down to how the browser behaves.First off where is your @font declared?  Is it inline to your HTML, declared in a CSS sheet on the page, or (hopefully) declared in an external CSS sheet?If it is not in an external sheet, try moving it to one (this is better practice anyway usually).If this doesn't help, you need to ask yourself is the fraction of a second difference really significantly detrimental to the user experience?  If it is, then consider JavaScript, there are a few things you might be able to do, redirects, pauses etc, but these might actually be worse than the original problem.  Worse for users, and worse to maintain.This link might help:http://paulirish.com/2009/fighting-the-font-face-fout/Edit: The best approach is probably to base64 encode your fonts.  This means your font will have to be loaded fully by the time your HTML is parsed and displayed.  You can do this with font squirrel's webfont generator https://www.fontsquirrel.com/tools/webfont-generator by clicking "Expert" and then "base64 encode".  This is how services like TypeKit work.Original answer:

Another way to detect if fonts are loaded would be using FontLoader https://github.com/smnh/FontLoader or by copying their strategy.They bind to the scroll event in the browser, because when the font loads it will resize the text.  It uses two containing divs (that will scroll when the height changes) and a separate fallback for IE.An alternative is to check the DOM periodically with setInterval, but using javascript events is far faster and superior.Obviously, you might do something like set the opacity of body to 0 and then display it in once the font loads.Joni Korpi has a nice article on loading fonts before the rest of the page.http://jonikorpi.com/a-smoother-page-load/He also uses a loading.gif to alleviate the delay so users won't get frustrated. Only IE loads first the font and then the rest of the page.

The other browsers load things concurrently for a reason. Imagine that there's a problem with the server hosting the font or with the font downloading.

You will hang your entire site until the font is loaded. On my opinion a flash of unstyled text is better than not seeing the site at allSince nobody mentioned that, I believe this question needs an update. The way I managed to solve the problem was using the "preload" option supported by modern browsers.In case someone does not need to support old browsers.some useful links with more details:https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Preloading_content

http://www.bramstein.com/writing/preload-hints-for-web-fonts.htmlUse https://github.com/typekit/webfontloaderand check the events in the configuration

https://github.com/typekit/webfontloader#configurationYou can use CSS font-display inside your @font-face. 

The keywords for all the available values are:Giulio Mainardi has written a nice article about all of them, and which you should use where on sitepoint.You can read it here: https://www.sitepoint.com/css-font-display-future-font-rendering-web/?utm_source=frontendfocus&utm_medium=emailThis code works very well for me. It uses the Font Loading API which has good support among modern browsers. The trick is to set the CSS color to transparent for elements using the font. Once loaded this is reset by adding font-loaded class to <html> element.Please replace DemoFont with something meaningful for your project to get it work.use this method.. use with Webfont.jsMaybe something like this:Then when the page loads, replace body's content with the actual content and hopefully, fully rendered fonts, you may have to play around with this though...

In other words, cells can span across columns and rows, which flexbox cannot do.This is why flexbox has a limited capacity for building grids. It's also a reason why the W3C has developed another CSS3 technology, Grid Layout (see below).In a flex container with flex-flow: row wrap, flex items must wrap to new rows.This means that a flex item cannot wrap under another item in the same row.Notice above how div #3 wraps below div #1, creating a new row. It cannot wrap beneath div #2.As a result, when items aren't the tallest in the row, white space remains, creating unsightly gaps.image credit: Jefree SujitIf you switch to flex-flow: column wrap, flex items will stack vertically and a grid-like layout is more attainable. However, a column-direction container has three potential problems right off the bat:As a result, a column-direction container may not be feasible in many cases.What you want can be achieved in 3  2 ways, CSS wise:(this solution has the very neat advantage of built-in column-span - pretty handy for titles). The disadvantage is ordering items in columns (first column contains first third of the items and so on...). I made a jsFiddle for this.absolute positioning after calculating rendered item sizes, via JavaScript (masonry plugin).the column approach seems a good compromise if you set column-width via vmin or vmax units and drop column-count (first snippet) , display:grid and vmin is also an option for the futur (second snippet).test demo with vmin a link among others https://web-design-weekly.com/2014/11/18/viewport-units-vw-vh-vmin-vmax/display:grid coud make it also easy with auto-fill but will require to set a span value to tallest image so rows and columns can inbricateyou can see https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/You can achieve the masonry effect as per your screenshot, but you've set the height of the outer div dynamicallyInstead of flexbox, I recommend to use columns for grids like this.

The best I've come up with so far are:In this case the text does not print in the margin, so there is white space above the image.In this case the text prints over or under the image.So... how can I accomplish this?It sure seems to have been asked before (2003), and before (2002), or before (2005)The last link actually suggest a javascript-based solution, but for a fixed (i.e. non fluid) solution.It is consistent however, with other advices foundOr this one:Anyway, as discussed in this thread, there is no easy solution...Cletus mentions in the comments this thread from 2003, which states once again the fact it can not easily be achieved.

However, it does refer to this Eric Meyer's article, which comes close to the effect you want to achieve.Yet, Chadwick Meyer suggests in his answer a solution based on the  :before CSS selector (variation of Leonard's answer).

It does work here.Well... this is a pretty old post but I struggled and got away with this with a small workaround. I needed to have an image aligned to the right, and exactly 170px from the top. And need text to flow on top, left and bottom of image. 

So what I did is create a  that is of 0px width, with 170px of height and float right. Then the img would float and clear right and voila!Worked pretty well :)The simplest solution i found is to wrap img inside a div element and then use padding-top and margin-bottom values to align it.This is my CSSand here is the HTMLThe reason padding and margin worked for me is because I use it inside the parent element "contentDiv" to auto adjust height of the div according to the content. Not sure if its of any use.For a jQuery solution, try the lowFloat plugin created by gilly3: https://github.com/gilly3/lowFloatFurther to the solution posted, I've used a quick JQuery hack to dynamically 

adjust the height of the pusher, by taking the height of the area I wanted to bottom-right align away from the height of the content area, and applying it to the pusher div, as so: It needs a few slight tweaks, but generally works as well as you're going to get!The solution I found involves that you have a div whose width does not changes, nor does the amount of text. Then you can position the image inside the text and have it align=right. So if you have correct amount of text around it, then you you get the image on the right and at the bottom of the div.Ok. So I've actually had this same problem and at some point the answer hit me like Saturday night cheese cake. It's almost the same hit and miss effect that you have when you try to set text wrapping in Word.Now all you have to do is just set it INSIDE the text where you want the lines to break. The text will float to the end of the text so it will always push the text to the left but if you put the image in the middle of the text like...the top part stays where it is and text is free to float above the image and the rest is pushed to the left of the image. It's a workaround but not nearly as tedious as using JS and if you use a WYSIWYG editor it's even easier. Come to think of it if you use a WYSIWYG editor it has that feature automatically. :P Problem solved.Cheers.

As specified in the W3 specification for Tables:I created the following example, but it doesn't work.HTML:JS:CSS:The missing part is:DemoI saw this post about a month ago when I was having similar problems.  I needed y-axis scrolling for a table inside of a ui dialog (yes, you heard me right).  I was lucky, in that a working solution presented itself fairly quickly.  However, it wasn't long before the solution took on a life of its own, but more on that later.The problem with just setting the top level elements (thead, tfoot, and tbody) to display block, is that browser synchronization of the column sizes between the various components is quickly lost and everything packs to the smallest permissible size.  Setting the widths of the columns seems like the best course of action, but without setting the widths of all the internal table components to match the total of these columns, even with a fixed table layout, there is a slight divergence between the headers and body when a scroll bar is present.The solution for me was to set all the widths, check if a scroll bar was present, and then take the scaled widths the browser had actually decided on, and copy those to the header and footer adjusting the last column width for the size of the scroll bar.  Doing this provides some fluidity to the column widths.  If changes to the table's width occur, most major browsers will auto-scale the tbody column widths accordingly.  All that's left is to set the header and footer column widths from their respective tbody sizes.This fiddle illustrates these notions: http://jsfiddle.net/borgboyone/gbkbhngq/.Note that a table wrapper or additional tables are not needed for y-axis scrolling alone.  (X-axis scrolling does require a wrapping table.)  Synchronization between the column sizes for the body and header will still be lost if the minimum pack size for either the header or body columns is encountered.  A mechanism for minimum widths should be provided if resizing is an option or small table widths are expected.The ultimate culmination from this starting point is fully realized here: http://borgboyone.github.io/jquery-ui-table/A.try this.mandatory parts:

How can I show a Child Div while keeping its Parent Div hidden?  Can this be done?My Code is below:I don't think it's possible.you can use javascript to pull the element out, or duplicate it and then show it.in jQuery you could copy an elementand then append to any visible element that be appropriate.Set the parent class's visibility to hidden or collapse. Set the child to visible. Something like this:Full example:

http://jsfiddle.net/pread13/h955D/153/Edited with help from @n1kkouAgreed, not possible with display:none. Here's a different solution that will hide parent and show child - however, the height of the parent will not be collapsed.Example: http://jsfiddle.net/luke_charde/jMYF7/Why not:instead of display:none if your Main Div is text only?This solution should collapse the text in the parent div without hiding the child div. Also still works with screen readers without doing weird things like bumping the div out of view or duplicating the object with JS.  No. Unfortunately for you, it is not possible.I used a jQuery trick to replace the parent code with the child code. It was something I needed for my specific problem, but it might be helpful for someone else:then the code:note that this will not affect the ID's of the DIVS... another option is this (that will keep the ID's the same:Since it's not possible to do that, you could clone/pull the element as mentioned in this answerBut if events on this element affect its parent/children you can try this workaround.Like this -Now trigger all events in div 'Inner-Div-Refer' to original div 'Inner-Div'. Like - Well, this is an old one, but I hit it too. My solution was a bit different:-The benefit of this approach is that the structure and position of the main div and child elements can remain unchanged throughout. This means that when you want to show the main div, you can simply remove the covering image. Also, if you want to see what the main div would look like when debugging you can just remove the covering image element in the browser debugger tools, such as firebug in firefox or ctrl+shift+i in chrome. Just remember to set the z-index on an element it needs to be positioned absolute, relative or fixed. If you have any problems getting the z-index to take effect it is probably to do with stacking contexts. See here for a good description of how to solve this.I know this is an older post and someone already accepted the answer but I prefer this method. JQuery will move the element to the body (or any other selected location) via the append() method. I store the parent in a variable and detach() it so if you need to put it all back together later you can easily do:And everything is back the way it was.I used simple JavaScript with querySelector to remove all target elements, while keeping what is inside them (now you can just apply any CSS selector):

I have seen a lot of sites using minified CSS and JavaScript to increase website response time but I have never seen any sites use minified HTML. Why would you not want your HTML to be minified?

2010-03-01 22:14:36Z

I have seen a lot of sites using minified CSS and JavaScript to increase website response time but I have never seen any sites use minified HTML. Why would you not want your HTML to be minified?Because if you're doing things properly you're serving HTML gzipped anyway, so the low-hanging fruit of HTML minification - whitespace - isn't all that relevant. There aren't lots of easy targets (e.g. variable names) for minification in HTML, which are present in CSS and JavaScript. Much of the content of HTML is the actual content of the page, which probably can't be minified (and, as others have pointed out, will almost certainly vary more frequently than your CSS or JS).I'd guess that most sites have static CSS and Javascript. This means they can be minified just once whenever they are updated. On the other hand, HTML tends to be dynamically generated, which means it would have to be minified on every page request, which is considerably more expensive than minifying static CSS and Javascript files.I don't think there is that much room for minification in HTML: You can remove white spaces and line breaks, but essentially, that's about it without actually getting into the page's structure. JS minification can shorten variable and function names, probably the biggest net profit in terms of saved space. With its fixed set of tags, HTML does not provide that possibility. The option of gzipping HTML probably eliminates much of the need to minify anyway, especially as it is usually enabled for HTML, while it (unnecessarily) not always is for the CSS and JS file types.Primarily because Javascript files and CSS stylesheets are often static files that will not change upon deployment. Markup, on the other hand, is often generated on the fly (with database-driven web apps, at least), and the number of "pages" is usually large and dynamic, which makes the benefits of minification more work than it's worth.Html content being gzipped takes care of most of the compression, minifying on top of that wouldn't accomplish much or save a great deal of bandwidth.Javascript you can minify as part of the build, the only way this would happen with the entire HTML content would be to minify every piece (what if it's generated?) or to have it minified the whole time (nightmare to work on?)  It's cost vs benefit, cost: marginal bandwidth, benefit: easier to work on, easier to generate, easier to debug, pretty in my source view window.

Is there an easier way to do that, or is that it?You will need two things.  The first is @media screen to activate the specific code at a certain screen size, used for responsive design.  The second is the use of the visibility: hidden attribute.  Once the browser/screen reaches 600pixels then #title_message will become hidden.EDIT: if you are using another CSS for mobile then just add the visibility: hidden; to #title_message.  Hope this helps you!Set the display property to none as the default, then use a media query to apply the desired styles to the div when the browser reaches a certain width. Replace 768px in the media query with whatever the minimum px value is where your div should be visible.This would be for a responsive design with a single page for an iphone screen specifically. Are you actually routing to a different mobile page?You can be guided by this example. On your css file:On your html file:The solution given didn't work for me on the desktop, it just showed both divs, although the mobile only showed the mobile div.

Hello I have select box with multiple choices and I need to hide the vertical scrollbar, is it possible?Okey, but how then I can achieve an effect where I can select item from list that has ID and then use jQuery to manage this id.click functions? What element I should use then?This is where we appreciate all the power of CSS3:FiddleI know this thread is somewhat old, but there are a lot of really hacky answers on here, so I'd like to provide something that is a lot simpler and a lot cleaner:As you can see in this fiddle, this solution provides you with flexibility if you don't know the exact number of select options you are going to have. It hides the scrollbar in the case that you don't need it without hiding possible extra option elements in the other case. Don't do all this hacky overlapping div stuff. It just makes for unreadable markup.No, you can't control the look of a select box in such detail.A select box is usually displayed as a dropdown list, but there is nothing that says that it always has to be displayed that way. How it is displayed depends on the system, and on some mobile phones for example you don't get a dropdown at all, but a selector that covers most or all of the screen.If you want to control how your form elements look in such detail, you have to make your own form controls out of regular HTML elements (or find someone else who has already done that).You can use a <div> to cover the scrollbar if you really want it to disappear.

Although it won't work on IE6, modern browsers do let you put a <div> on top of it.Chrome (and maybe other webkit browsers) only:my cross-browser .no-scroll snippet:Like Guffa said, you cannot reliably get that much control over native controls.  The best way is probably to make a box of elements with radio buttons beside each item, then use labels and JavaScript to make the 'rows' interactive, so clicking on a radio button or label will color the selected row.Change padding-bottom , i.e may be the simplest possible way . I worked out Arraxas solution to:For future reference if somebody else runs into this problem.

I found a solution that should work in all modern browsers:Basically this way the scrollbar is set to a width of 0 and is hence not displayed.I think you can't. The SELECT element is rendered at a point beyond the reach of CSS and HTML.

Is it grayed out?But you can try to add a "size" atribute.

Is it possible to make a capsule shape using border-radius without a set width or height?I want the left and right sides to be completely rounded while the capsule would remain straight along it's horizontal length. Setting the radius to 50% doesn't seem to give the desired affect.Applying a very large border radius seems to work on many browsers (IE9+, FF, Chrome) like this mod of David's fiddle http://jsfiddle.net/cthQW/1/Yes, this is possible (albeit I've only tested in Chromium 28/Ubuntu 12.10):JS Fiddle demo.The important information is, obviously, the 20%/50% property-value; the 20% is the 'horizontal length' of the radius, whereas the 50% is the 'vertical length'; using two different measurements gives an elliptical curve to the border, instead of a single measurement, which yields the more circular radius. Obviously this requires a certain amount of adjustment to your own requirementsReferences:If you use percentages, it takes the element width to calculate the radius. To have the capsule-shaped element, you need to pass to the border-radius property units like rem or px (neither I know the reason for this, but it works). This is why it works when passing 500px. You can use the same value for line-height and border-radius properties if you want.Here you have an example in CodePen. Try to change the variable $label-height to see how the shape is maintained while the height of the button changes.In this example, you don't need to set the width or height of the element. You just need to adjust the content's height and padding.The padding property is useful to set a separation between the contents and the component border. See how it looks if I only set the left padding.If you set the line-height property of the container, you will set automatically the container height, and center the content inside the container at the same time.If you want to set the component's width to the component's content width, you can set the component's display property to inline-block, and use FlexBox to arrange them in a column, for example. And then, set the left and right margins to auto, to avoid the element to grow to its parent width.And if you want to leave a space between the components, you can set the margin-top property between consecutive components.Hope it helps :)This is what I have found to work well:border-radius: 50vh;Browser support looks good for that now too.To explain, the vh is a "Viewport Unit" that computes the height of the viewport in pixels. By saying 50vh to declare the border radius, it is 50% * (Viewport Height)px.This can be easily achieved using HTML Span. You have to just set the background-color and border-radius.

2012-04-08 15:58:36Z

i have some code for example here in htmlif i used the following css code for styling it:the question is : How can i prevent and isolate the tags inside the mydiv div tag from styling by the public tags style ?CSS Cascading and Inheritance Level 3 introduces the all shorthand property and the unset keyword, which, together, allow you to achieve this conveniently.You’ll need to apply all: initial to your div and all: unset to its descendants:You may want to use a class on your div instead of an id, so that any rules you write to style its descendants won’t have to match or beat the high specificity used in this rule.To be really safe, you may want to block styles on potential pseudo-element descendants too:Alternatively, for broader browser support, you can manually attempt to do what all does by setting all known CSS properties (don’t forget the prefixed versions):You can encourage browser support for the all shorthand property and track its adoption with these issue links:Up-to-date browser support information for the all shorthand property is available here.You cannot technically, that's how CSS is suppose to work. If there is any style defined for

div tag in your style sheet it will be applied to all div elements.Few things that you can try is don't style with tag name  instead give class name and give style declaration to class. so that you can make sure where all styles will go.OR. if you want some specific Div tag to not have the style while other Divs to have. you can always reset it give some different class name or id and reset the style declarationsOld question, but things have changed a little bit since the accepted answer. There is now a CSSWG-recommended keyword called revert which would be better suited than initial and unset to solve this problem, as it resets an element's property to the value defined in the user agent stylesheet rather than the initial value of the property regardless of which element it's used on. So for instance, a div inside #mydiv will have its display set to block as we would expect and not inline.You'd have to do this:Unfortunately, revert is not supported by any browser other than Safari (for Mac and iOS) at the time of writing.There is also something else to take in consideration regarding the accepted answer. If you want to style anything inside #mydiv, you need to do so with a selector that is at least as specific as the one you used to unset or revert everything, otherwise it will be overridden by that rule, even if it comes after it in the CSS.So you'd need to do something like this (note the #mydiv which boost the specificity of the rules):One thing that might be helpful is the CSS direct child selector, which is available in all browsers including IE7+. That lets you apply styling that doesn't cascade down into children. For example in your code you could use this CSS:And that CSS would only apply to elements directly on the BODY element.iframe is also a decent solution for isolation of styles if it doesn't complicate other business logic. Plus this can be done in pure JavaScript and may work in older browsers too.This worked perfectly for me when I had to embed a complex HTML file into my webpage fetched remotely without MixedContent warning and without parent HTML styles overriding the embedded HTML. Thanks to https://benfrain.com/sandbox-local-htmlcss-code-snippets-inside-iframe-style-guidespattern-libraries/ for this excellent idea!Though #mydiv * { all: unset } CSS trick, as suggested in the accepted solution here works, it ended being a complex browser operation as there were many DOM nodes on my page.

I want this all on the same line using bootstrap, but I cannot seem to get it to work correctly.Here's my code:Here's what it looks like now:How about using an input group to style it on the same line?Here's the final HTML to use:Which will look like this:Here's a Stack Snippet Demo:I'll leave it as an exercise to the reader to translate it into an asp:textbox element@KyleMit's answer on Bootstrap 4 has changed a littleThe problem is that .form-control class renders like a DIV element which according to the normal-flow-of-the-page renders on a new line. One way of fixing issues like this is to use display:inline property. So, create a custom CSS class with display:inline and attach it to your component with a .form-control class. You have to have a width for your component as well.There are other ways of handling this issue (like arranging your form-control components inside any of the .col classes), but the easiest way is to just make your .form-control an inline element (the way a span would render)Not sure if this was available in 2014, but you can now.It only works on screen resolutions greater than 768px though.Valid for BS 3.3.7:Unfortunately if you run the snippet it won't look right here, because it's in a frame that has a narrow width, but if you copy it somewhere else and run it on a wide screen it will work. I just noticed there is a "full screen" button in stackoverflow, click that and you can see it.Reference: https://getbootstrap.com/docs/3.3/css/#forms-inlineFor Bootstrap 4@KyleMit answer is one way to  solve this, however we may chose to avoid the undivided input fields acheived by input-group class. A better way to do this is by using form-group and row classes on a parent div and use input elements with grid-system classes provided by bootstrap.

EDIT: Updated the broken link to the blog post.I had the same bug.I fixed it by executing this script on domready (only for IE8 of course):This lets IE8 redraw all :before and :after pseudo elementsI recently encountered this as well, and fixed it by including the @font-face twice in my CSS file. The first @font-face is used by IE and the second is used by other browsers.Source: http://www.boonex.com/n/ie8-icon-font-fix-and-unused-language-keys-2012-08-20I was experimenting exactly the same problem. In IE8 the webfont icon (using pseudo-elements) sometimes renders the fallback font but when you hover it the webfont icon comes visible.The icons were implemented using :after and :before with IE7 support, like this.In my case, the project is developed in HTML5 and using htmlshiv to support the new HTML5 tags in older browsers.The problem was ridiculously solved placing the html5shiv script tag below the main CSS:I'm happy now :) I hope that helps!I was having a similar issue where the font would not show up until I hovered over the parent element. I was able to fix this problem by triggering a focus event on the elements parent.element.parent().trigger('focus');Hope this helps someone!Workaround:Find stylesheet and reload on document ready if IE8:Sample HTML:Sample JavaScript:The above solutions didn't fix the issue for me when IE8 is refreshed. Also I found some problems where adding a stylesheet would break the IE8 background size fix backgroundsize.min.htcSo here's what I did:Add ie8 class to html tag:Add loading class to the body:Override the CSS content attribute only for IE8:Now remove the loading class on DOM ready:Now it works!Based on the answer from @ausi, you can refactor this with jQuery and CoffeeScript down to 4 lines:or with JavaScript syntax:I had a similar glitch in Chrome. Here is my fix:My guess is that the pseudo css styling was rendered before the webfont was ready, which resulted in blank glyphs. After the page loaded, hovering or altering the css in any way caused them to magically appear. So my fix just forces a css update that does nothing.For me, the problem was simply solved using the declaration !important on the content attribute. I.e.:Alright, so I've been trying to fix this issue for a while.

Weirdly enough the icomoon demo kept working in IE8 but mine never did, even though I felt like I had pretty much the same thing in place. So I started boiling everything down (the icomoon demo as well as my own implementation) and what I found two things that needed to be there for this to work.First, I found that I needed to keep the cachebuster on the filename.So in my implementation I had:But what I needed was:Second, and this one doesn't make sense, is that I needed something in the stylesheet that had a :hover pseudo selector. It doesn't matter what it's on or what the rules for it are, it just needed something and then the icons would appear when I hovered over them.So I simply inserted [data-icon]:hover{} into my CSS stylesheet (just like that, without any rules).I wish I could explain to you why this works, but I don't understand. My best guess is that this triggers some sort of refresh in IE8 and causes the icons to show up.My IE8 issue was solved by removing the double-colon in the pseudo-element selector.Does not display an icon in IE8...Does display an icon in IE8...Ok so here's a variation of @ausi's solution that I've used which has worked for me. This solution comes from Adam's comment at the bottom of this article http://andymcfee.com/2012/04/04/icon-fonts-pseudo-elements-and-ie8/I thought I'd put it here in more detail to make it quicker for others to use. Set an extra class eg. ie-loading-fix on the html tag for IE8.

Include all your CSS and then after that have a conditional JS file for IE8. For example:Then at the top of your main CSS file include something like:Then in your IE8 js/ie.js file include the following:This JS will remove the ie-loading-fix styling which is hiding all :before and :after content and will force IE8 to redraw all :before and :after content once the page has loaded.This solution fixed an issue I was having with Font Awesome v4.4 which would frequently switch IE8 into Compatibility View or crash even though I was explicitly setting the page to load in Edge mode using the meta tag.If I am not wrong then IE doesn't reads TTF font, it requires EOT fontsI did some research as per @vieron answer and it turns out that another way to fix this problem is to block page rendering for a few miliseconds so font could be loaded before content. Though, blocking page rendering isn't smartest way to solve this, because you can't know how much ms you should block.I proved it by putting php file as source file for javascript.block.phpIf you have any external javascript libraries such as HTML5shiv, this happens automagically, except you are running site on local network (intranet or localhost) with very low latency and no scripts before content.That explains the fact that the problem isn't more widespreaded and noticed.I really tried hard to find an elegant solution, but I can't find something that excludes javascript or blocking page rendering for IE.This is the fix,  we have faced this issue with IE7, IE8 and IE9 when using ajax

I cannot get z-index working on a iframe that contains a pdf file with IE8. It works with Google Chrome.Example (JSFiddle):HTMLCSS

2012-10-16 09:21:35Z

I cannot get z-index working on a iframe that contains a pdf file with IE8. It works with Google Chrome.Example (JSFiddle):HTMLCSSUpdate: Matthew Wise has a really clever alternative solution which you should consider—especially if you're having trouble with my approach or dislike ugly hacks!There is a way to cover windowed elements in IE with other elements, but you're not going to like it.Legacy IE categorises elements into two types: windowed and windowless.Regular elements like div and input are windowless. They are rendered by the browser itself in a single MSHTML plane and respect each other's z-order.Elements rendered outside of MSHTML are windowed; for example, select (rendered by the OS) and ActiveX controls. They respect each other's z-order, but occupy a separate MSHTML plane that is painted on top of all windowless elements.The only exception is iframe. In IE 5, iframe was a windowed element. This was changed in IE 5.5; it is now a windowless element, but for backwards compatibility reasons it will still draw over windowed elements with a lower z-indexIn other words: iframe respects z-index for both windowed and windowless elements. If you position an iframe over a windowed element, any windowless elements positioned over the iframe will be visible!The PDF will always be painted on top of the regular page content—like select elements were until IE 7. The fix is to position another iframe between your content and the PDF.jsFiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/Jordan/gDuCE/HTML:​

CSS:This has been tested and should work in IE 7–9. If you feel persnickety about it showing up in the DOM for other browsers, you can add it with JavaScript or wrap it in an IE-only conditional comment:The workaround with the additional IFRAME does work in simple cases but I have spent a morning trying to get the overlay to respect transparency. Basically our application has modal popups whereby a full-window overlay behind the popups is rendered 'greyed out' (background colour black, opacity 0.25) to indicate to the user that the pop-ups are modal. With the workaround, the embedded PDF view never gets greyed out with the rest of the window so still looks 'active' and indeed you can still interact with the PDF viewer.Our solution is to use Mozilla's pdf.js library: https://github.com/mozilla/pdf.js/ - embedding an IFRAME pointing at the test URL http://mozilla.github.com/pdf.js/web/viewer.html?file=compressed.tracemonkey-pldi-09.pdf works straight out of the box respecting z-index, transparency, the lot, no hacks required! Seems that they use their own rendering engine which generates standard HTML representing the content of the PDF.I Had been trying to fix the same issue and my scenario was similar. I was trying to render a youtube Video on my page and on top of the video i wanted to place some div with some information.But the youtube video being contained into an iframe wasn't letting me do that. Irrespective of thez-index that i gave to the elements.Then this post helped - https://stackoverflow.com/a/9074366/1484384Basically its about the wmode. Check the above post to see how to work with it.Here is some code from that post:Or//Fix z-index youtube video embeddingFor those who are using jQueryUI, I came up with the following solution.Add the following function and call it from the open event of your dialogs.

I get that in the simple example above, I could simply use translate rather than translate3d - the point here is to strip the code down to the bare essentials.Webkit treats 3d transformed elements as textures instead of vectors in order to provide hardware 3d acceleration.

This is what I want:The closest I've got. Applying margin on flexbox items, then removing half of it from the first & last children.The problem is that :first-child is not always the first visually, because I may alter the layout order (example).Is there a way to take the visual order into account when applying the margin?You can try setting the same margin for all the boxes, and then revert this on the container:So replace this:With this:here is another way of getting the same thing.While Rejoy answer works perfectly, it's not responsive-ready, because the rows are locked.flex-flow is your new friend. However, flex is not without bugs.

The negative margin trick we know from various grid framework does work, unless you are on IE, where the elements get wrapped too early because it uses content-box as box-size. But there is an easy workaround.Working example: https://jsfiddle.net/ys7w1786/The boxes come with flex-basis: auto, because of IE. But we can simply use width instead:What I did to approach this, since I wasn't sure how many elements I'd have within each flex space. For example, I am building a Drupal theme and have four regions that align side-by-side, but I want the full width to be taken up, even if there is content in only three of the regions.HTML looks like this:CSS looks like this:This leaves me with a layout like so (ignore the ugliness, the colours are only to demonstrate):

There are some other classes added such as 'halves', 'thirds', and 'quarters' to help out making things responsive on smaller and/or larger screens.Another solid point for using Flex is that you can specify the strategy to use for the remaining space:The desired layout can be achieved using a wrapper div with negative marginWorking code http://jsfiddle.net/8cju5jpd/Trying to stick on your question:I would say no, the same way you cannot style an element based on the value of, let's say, its background color. To do so, you could write custom classes to set the flex order and then subclass based on them.Please check out this interesting thread where I posted my solution on spacing:

Better way to set distance between flexbox itemsThe CSS spec has recently been updated to apply gap properties to flexbox elements in addition to CSS grid elements. Not all browsers support this yet (just Firefox at time of writing; the bug tracker page for adding it to Chrome is here), but this should soon be something you can do with just gap: 10px (or whatever size you want) without needing to deal with margins, :first-child, :last-child, etc.is it bad to create an dummy div / View for spacing?

Normally, you center images with display: block; margin: auto, but if the image is larger than the container, it overflows to the right. How do I make it overflow to the both sides equally? The width of the container is fixed and known. The width of the image is unknown.HTML  CSS   jQuery​See it on jsFiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/4eYX9/30/Requiring one extra wrapper (tested in FireFox, IE8, IE7):There was a problem with the original answer (below). If the image is larger than the container that outer is centered on with it's auto margins, then it truncates the image on the left and creates excessive space on the right, as this fiddle shows.We can resolve that by floating inner right and then centering from the right. This still truncates the img off the page to the left, but it does so by explicitly pushing it that way and then centers back off of that, the combination of which is what prevents the extra horizontal scroll on the right. Now we only get as much right scroll as we need in order to see the right part of the image.Fiddle Example (Borders in fiddle are for demo only.)Essential CSSIf you desire no right scroll at all for wide imagesThen using the above, also set whatever element wraps outer (like body or a third wrapper) to have overflow: hidden.Fiddle Example (Borders in fiddle are for demo only.)HTMLCSSHere's a 2 line CSS solution (a couple more lines might be required for cross-browser support):Alternative pure CSS solution is to use transform attribute:  HTML:  CSS:FiddleJust to add a overflow:hidden to parent div to hide the extra area of the image.Your best bet is to set it as background image of the container instead.In fact there is a simpler pure css/html way (without large horizontal scroll) :Html :Css :If you don't want to see image overflowWith image overflow visibleA background solution with image overflow visible :Html :Css :assuming outer is in a width specified container.I can only think of a Javascript solution since what you need to do is relatively position the image a negative amount to the left of its container:jQueryI found this to be a more elegant solution, without flex, similar to something above, but more generalized (applies on both vertical and horizontal):I don't think there is a pure CSS solution (Except for the next answer :)).  However with Javascript it would be just a matter of finding the width of the image, subtracting the container width, dividing by two and you have how far to the left of the container you need.

There is a rendering issue with Google Chrome and Opera (why?=) with such code:As you can see, I am trying to make sidebar static on the right side.

Everything works fine, until you add some <UL> tag on the page:http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkhH6di2M0cThe fixed div sometimes starts to disappear when I click anchor links.What can be done to avoid such behavior?Adding -webkit-transform: translateZ(0) to the #sidebar fixed the issue for me.I've used translateZ(0) to fix numerous Chrome display bugs over the years. The rationale is that by invoking 3D transformation, re-paint is separated from the rest of the CSS pain stack (I can't provide much more detail than that, it's pretty much all Greek to me). In any case, it appears to work for me!This is not a generic solution (will need to be tweaked depending on the positioning requirements of the element in question). It works by forcing continuous repaints (via CSS animation) on a property that could affect layout (forcing other layout factors to be calculated and rendered, ie maintaining fixed positioning), but in practice do not. In this case, I've used margin-bottom, because there's no way that's going to affect your page layout (but Opera doesn't know that!):Note: the solution is not perfect, in that (on my machine at least) the bug test cases will result in a minute flicker as Opera loses positioning and quickly redraws. Sadly I think this is as good as you will get, because as George says in his answer, this is Opera's natural behaviour between redraws — in theory my code makes redraw for the element continuous, but in practice there will be infinitesimal gaps.EDIT 2 (2013-11-05): I've since encountered variations of this bug quite often. Although the original poster's reduced test case presents a perfectly legitimate bug, most occurences have been in situations where there is already a 3D transform operating on the body (or similarly high up the DOM tree). This is often used as a hack to force GPU rendering, but will actually lead to nasty repaint issues like this. 2 no-op 3D transforms don't make a right: if you're using one higher up the tree, try removing it first before adding another one.EDIT 3 (2014-12-19): Chris reports that translateZ(0) doesn't work in some cases where scale3d(1,1,1) does.The key for Chrome is:By adding this, the fixed position problem should be fixed.It makes sense if you understand how Normal Flow of the document works. Let's say it's an edge case scenario. There is no height declared in any element and #sidebar is taken OUT of the normal flow of the document by being position:fixed.If you add a height property to #sidebar (pixels, not percentages) the problem is solved.I would suggest including Normalize.css, I think it will take care of the bug.

If any of divs are in passive state (i.e. it's not animating at least for 2 seconds), I won't display them to increase animation performance.The question is: which css property is the most suitable for this?And how can I measure rendering performance like fps, gpu usage?The answer found here will answer your first question (most likely display:none as the space is collapsed completely).To your second question, tools such as this will probably be useful for you. However 40,000 divs sounds like way too many and you will probably have better performance using canvas or SVG (for example, using the KineticJS library as this handles animations - transformation, rotation, scale, etc.) for you.They all render the element invisible, yet differ in whether it occupies space and consumes clicksAnd when we say it consumes click, that means it also consumes other pointer events like ondblclick,onmousedown,onmousemove etc.In essence "visibility: hidden" behaves like a combination of "opacity: 0" and "pointer-events: none".display:none because the divs are taken out of the flow then, thus their position does not have to be calculated.That being said, 40000 divs sounds crazy. Did you consider the alternatives like HTML5 canvas or SVG?Perfomamce will be an issue if display:none or visibility:hidden is used since they trigger paint and layout in most browsers which means your browser will redraw the viewport whenever those two changes so I will recommend opacity but still for that number of divs it will still be not perfomant as expected you can try webgl using a library called html-gl which render your divs in webgl check https://github.com/PixelsCommander/HTML-GLdisplay:none will hide the whole element and remove that from layout space whereas visibility:hidden hides an element but take up the same space as before.

Opacity can be used if you want to create transparency or fade effect. Sometime i use visibility and opacity together to achieve effect to avoid click evente.g. normal state/element removed from screen:hover state/element on screen:display:none : occupies no space, no elements here.opacity:0 : occupies space, you can click on element behind it.visibility:hidden : occupies space and you can not click element behind it.

I am trying to center a <ul> inside a <div>. I tried the followingandThis is not working.CSS:I want the ul to be centered inside the container.Following is a list of solutions to centering things in CSS horizontally. The snippet includes all of them.Notes:You can horizontally center a block-level element by assigning a fixed width and setting margin-right and margin-left to auto.Notes:This is similar to the quirky centering method which uses absolute positioning and negative margins.Notes:Just like the first solution, you use auto values for right and left margins, but don’t assign a width. If you don’t need to support IE7 and below, this is better suited, although it feels kind of hacky to use the table property value for display.Centering an element just like you would do with regular text is possible as well. Downside: You need to assign values to both a container and the element itself.Notes:Make the left and right margins of your UL auto and assign it a width:Edit: As kleinfreund has suggested, you can also center align the container and give the ul an inline-block display, but you then also have to give the LIs either a left float or an inline display.You can check this solved your problem...http://jsfiddle.net/thirtydot/VCZgW/You can quickly and easily center the ul with CSS Flexbox.

with Font Awesome 4 the code was as follows:I tried to change the font name but it does not workYour Unicode is wrong f107Or in other case, font-weight: 900; will save you. Some icons in font awesome 5 not working without font-weight: 900;.Strangely you must put the 'font-weight: 900' in some icons so that it shows them.The problem is in the font-weight.

For Font Awesome 5 you have to use {font-weight:900}Using the fontawesome-all.css file: Changing the "Brands" font-family from "Font Awesome 5 Free" to "Font Awesome 5 Brands" fixed the issues I was having. I can't take all of the credit - I fixed my own local issue right before looking at the CDN version: https://use.fontawesome.com/releases/v5.0.6/css/all.cssThey've got the issue sorted out on the CDN as well.Requiring 900 weight is not a weirdness but a intentional restriction added by FontAwesome (since they share the same unicode but just different font-weight) so that you are not hacking your way into using the 'solid' and 'light' icons, most of which are available only in the paid 'Pro' version.Since FontAwesome 5, you have to enable a new "searchPseudoElements" option to use FontAwesome icons this way: See also this question: Font awesome 5 on pseudo elements and the new Font Awesome API: https://fontawesome.com/how-to-use/font-awesome-apiAdditionaly, change font-family in your CSS code to I didn't want to use the 'all' version, so searched the 'fontawesome-all.min.css' file (previously included in the header) for 'family' tag and found at the end a declaration @font-face{font-family:**Font Awesome\ 5 Free**;font-style:normal;So, in the stylesheet for an element where I wanted to use the content: "\f0c8"; code, I've added (or changed to) font-family: Font Awesome\ 5 Free; and it worked.I had tried all above the solutions for Font Awesome 5 but it wasn't working for me. :( Finally, I got a solution! Just use font-family: "Font Awesome 5 Pro"; in your CSS instead of using font-family: "Font Awesome 5 Free OR Solids OR Brands";npm i --save @fortawesome/fontawesome-freeMy Sccs:It worked fine for me!the solution is call it like normal font:Strangely you have to include the font-family and the font-weight for it to work.

Is there any real difference between using <strong> and <em> instead of the CSS properties:Also, what is really the reason that both options exist? I could be wrong but didn't <strong> and <em> came on the scene quite a while after font-weight and font-style became standard CSS properties? If so, there must be some reason for them.HTML represents meaning; CSS represents appearance. How you mark up text in a document is not determined by how that text appears on screen, but simply what it means. As another example, some other HTML elements, like headings, are styled font-weight: bold by default, but they are marked up using <h1>–<h6>, not <strong> or <b>.In HTML5, you use <strong> to indicate important parts of a sentence, for example:And you use <em> to indicate linguistic stress, for example:These elements are semantic elements that just happen to have bold and italic representations by default, but you can style them however you like. For example, in the <em> sample above, you could represent stress emphasis in uppercase instead of italics, but the functional purpose of the <em> element remains the same — to change the context of a sentence by emphasizing specific words or phrases over others:Note that the original answer (below) applied to HTML standards prior to HTML5, in which <strong> and <em> had somewhat different meanings, <b> and <i> were purely presentational and had no semantic meaning whatsoever. Like <strong> and <em> respectively, they have similar presentational defaults but may be styled differently.You use <strong> and <em> to indicate intense emphasis and normal emphasis respectively.Or think of it this way: font-weight: bold is closer to <b> than <strong>, and font-style: italic is closer to <i> than <em>. These visual styles are purely visual: tools like screen readers aren't going to understand what bold and italic mean, but some screen readers are able to read <strong> and <em> text in a more emphasized tone.YES! There is a clear difference.The <em> element represents stress emphasis of its contents. The level of emphasis that a particular piece of content has is given by its number of ancestor <em> elements.The placement of emphasis changes the meaning of the sentence. The element thus forms an integral part of the content. The precise way in which emphasis is used in this way depends on the language.Reference (examples): See W3C ReferenceThe problem is an issue of semantic meaning (as BoltClock mentions) and visual rendering.Originally HTML used <b> and <i> for these purposes, entirely stylistic commands, laid down in the semantic environment of the document markup.  CSS is an attempt to separate out as far as possible the stylistic elements of the medium.  Thus style information such as bold and italics should go in CSS.<strong> and <em> were introduced to fill the semantic need for text to be marked as more important or stressed.  They have default stylistic interpretations akin to bold and italic, but they are not bound to that fate.<strong> and <em> are semantic markup elements, ex: a machine (a search engine bot, a screen reader) may be able to understand that a strong element is more important than other elements.CSS styles are the way you visualize them for humans, conventionally in bold or italic text.Separation of presentation and content on Wikipedia<strong> and <em> - unlike <b> and <i> - have clear purpose for web browsers for the blind. A blind person doesn't browse the web visually, but by sound such as text readers. <strong> and <em>, in addition to encouraging something to be bold or italic, also convey loudness or stressing syllables respectively (OH MY! & Ooooooh Myyyyyyy!). Audio-only browsers are unpredictable when it comes to <b> and <i>... they may make them loud or stress them or they may not... you never can be sure unless you use <strong> and <em>.

I'm often confused by CSS override rules: in general, I realize that more specific style-sheets override less specific ones, and that specificity is determined by how many selectors are specified.  There's also the !important keyword, which plays a role as well.So, here's a simple example: I have a table with two table cells.  The table itself has a CSS rule which applies to all cells within the table.  However, the second table cell has it's own rule which should override the general table rule:But... when I open this in a browser, I see that rule2 doesn't override rule1.  Okay - so I guess I need to make rule2 more "specific", but I can't really define any further selectors since I just want to apply it to a particular table cell.  So, I tried putting the ! important keyword, but that doesn't work either.I'm able to override rule2 if I wrap the text node in a <div>, like:...and then make the CSS rule more specific:This works, but it's not exactly what I want.  For one thing, I want to apply the rule to the table cell, not the DIV.  It makes a difference because you can still see the background color of rule1 as a border around the div.So, what do I need to do to tell CSS I want rule2 to override rule1 for the td element?

In this case I would add table.rule1 trfrom rule one and add it to rule two.After a while I find this gets natural, but I know some people disagree. For those people I would suggest looking into LESS or SASS.The specificity is calculated based on the amount of id, class and tag selectors in your rule. Id has the highest specificity, then class, then tag. Your first rule is now more specific than the second one, since they both have a class selector, but the first one also has two tag selectors.To make the second one override the first one, you can make more specific by adding information of it's parents:Here is a nice article for more information on selector precedence.The important needs to be inside the ;in fact i believe this should override it

Does CSS have a :blur selector (pseudo-class)?

[Does CSS have a :blur selector (pseudo-class)?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11703241/does-css-have-a-blur-selector-pseudo-class)

I know there is a :focus selector. I can't seem to find use of or documentation of a :blur selector. Is there one?

2012-07-28 17:36:59Z

I know there is a :focus selector. I can't seem to find use of or documentation of a :blur selector. Is there one?There is no :blur pseudo-class in CSS.The dynamic pseudo-classes, like other pseudo-classes and in fact all other selectors, represent states; they do not represent events or transitions between states in terms of the document tree. To wit: the :focus pseudo-class represents an element that is in focus; it does not represent an element that has just received focus, nor does there exist a :blur pseudo-class to represent an element that has just lost focus.Similarly, this applies to the :hover pseudo-class. While it represents an element which has a pointing device over it, there is neither a :mouseover pseudo-class for an element that has just been pointed to nor a :mouseout pseudo-class for an element that has just been pointed away from.If you need to apply styles to an element that is not in focus, you have two choices:No, CSS has no blur pseudo-selector, presumably because blur is more of an event than a state. (It would be unclear when something should lose its blur state).All regular selectors are by default not focussed. So you don't need a special blur selector.These are the selectors by precedence.Use the general transition to set the blur transition.

Otherwise, this wouldn't work. Also note that I've used 0 as a handle value for when the timeout isn't pending; 0 isn't a valid return value from setTimeout so it makes a handy flag.This is also one of the (few) places I think you'd be better off with setInterval rather than setTimeout. setInterval repeats. So:Used like this:All of the above notwithstanding, I'd want to find a way to make setBgPosition stop things itself, by detecting that some completion condition has been satisfied.I know this is an old question, I'd like to post my approach anyway. This way you don't have to handle the 0 trick that T. J. Crowder expained.You need to use a variable to track "doneness" and then test it on every iteration of the loop. If done == true then return.SIMPLIEST WAY TO HANDLE TIMEOUT LOOPAs this is tagged with the extjs tag it may be worth looking at the extjs method: http://docs.sencha.com/extjs/6.2.0/classic/Ext.Function.html#method-intervalThis works much like setInterval, but also takes care of the scope, and allows arguments to be passed too:when you want to stop you can use clearInterval to stop itAn example use case would be:I am not sure, but might be what you want:

The photo's dimensions is unknown. Usually it's a rectangle form.

I've tried a lot of methods:CSS:HTML:The approach is wrong, you need to apply the border-radius to the container div instead of the actual image.This would work:The object-fit property provides a non-hackish way for doing this (with image centered).  It has been supported in major browsers for a few years now (Chrome/Safari since 2013, Firefox since 2015, and Edge since 2015) with the exception of Internet Explorer.  If you can live without the <img> tag, I suggest you use the photo as a background image.Try this:DEMO here.OR:DEMO here.Johnny's solution is good. I found that adding min-width:100%, really helps images fill the entire circle. You could do this with a combination of JavaScript to get optimal results or use ImageMagick - http://www.imagemagick.org/script/index.php if you're really serious about getting it right. I know many of the solutions mentioned above works, you can as well try flex.But my image was rectangular and not fitting properly. so this is what i did.and for the image inside, you can use,This is helpful when you are using bootstrap 4 classes.insert the image and then backhand all you need is:** the image code will be here automatically**The best way I've been able to do this is with using the new css object-fit (1) property and the padding-bottom (2)  hack.You need a wrapper element around the image. You can use whatever you want, but I like using the new HTML picture tag.You need to use jQuery to do this. This approach gives you the abbility to have dynamic images and do them round no matter the size.My demo has one flaw right now I don't center the image in the container, but ill return to it in a minute (need to finish a script I'm working on).DEMO

so first animation will start from 0% and end in his frame(20%),

and each next animation will starts from previous animation ending point and end when it reach his frame (+20% ),now we need to make each animation fade in from 0 to 1 opacity and fade out from 1 to 0,so we will add another 2 points (steps) for each animation after starting and before ending point to handle the full opacity(1)http://codepen.io/El-Oz/pen/WwPPZQhttp://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css3_pr_animation-keyframes.aspit is actually a browser issue... use -webkit- for chrome

2012-09-17 16:40:50Z

I don't know if there is an issue, but I was wondering why the overflow:hidden does not function on fixed parent/children element.Here's an example:CSS and HTML:Live demo: jsFiddleBecause a fixed position element is fixed with respect to the viewport, not another element. Therefore since the viewport isn't cutting it off, the overflow becomes irrelevant.ref: http://www.w3.org/wiki/CSS_absolute_and_fixed_positioning#Fixed_positioningYou could consider using CSS clip: rect(top, right, bottom, left); to clip a fixed positioned element to a parent. See demo at http://jsfiddle.net/lmeurs/jf3t0fmf/.Beware, use with care!Though the clip style is widely supported, main disadvantages are that:See http://tympanus.net/codrops/2013/01/16/understanding-the-css-clip-property/ for more info.EDIT: Chrome seems to handle positioning of and CSS3 transforms on child elements a lot better when applying backface-visibility, so just to be sure we added:to the main child element.Also note that it's not fully supported by older / mobile browsers or it might take some extra effort. See our implementation for the menu at bellafuchsia.com.EDIT 2014-11-02: Demo URL has been updated.2016 update:You can create a new stacking context, as seen on Coderwall: Which refers to http://dev.w3.org/csswg/css-transforms/#transform-renderingAs an alternative to using clip you could also use {border-radius: 0.0001px} on a parent element. It works not only with absolute/fixed positioned elements.If you want to hide overflow on fixed-position elements, the simplest approach I've found is to place the element inside a container element, and apply position:fixed and overflow:hidden to that element instead of the contained element (you must remove position:fixed from the contained element for this to work). The content of the fixed container should then be clipped as expected.In my case I was having trouble with using object-fit:cover on a fixed-position element (it was spilling outside the bounds of the page body, regardless of overflow:hidden). Placing it inside a fixed container with overflow:hidden on the container fixed the issue.I had a similar, quite complex problem with a fluid layout, where the right column had a fixed width and the left one had a flexible width. My fixed container should have the same width as the flexible column. Here is my solution:HTMLCSSLive Demo: http://jsfiddle.net/hWCub/Fixed position elements are positioned relative to the browser window, so the parent element is basically irrelevant.To get the effect you want, where the overflow on the parent clips the child, use position: absolute instead: http://jsfiddle.net/DBHUv/1/

With it, you can use prefixes for every browser.Then you only have to add or remove this class to your animated element yo pause / resume the animation.This is to extend the answer given by Luis HijarrubiaIn my page I was triggering the change of class from the parent element. All I wanted to do was rotate the image inside. But it seems that because I was not using the hover, the adding of the paused class made no difference to the animation state. The use of !important ensured that these values were overwritten by the new added CSS values.I havent tested it but perhaps something like this?

Because you set the color for the path using the SVG attribute fill="#FAFAFA", CSS doesn't process it and the transition doesn't fade.Instead if you use CSS to set the color, the transition will behave as expectedSo all I had to do to make the transition work is give the #europe a starting fill to transition from.Here's a working JSFiddle.Or, doing it inline can be more convenient (style=""):Just in order for CSS to do your fading, it needs to handle the start and end values in CSS/inline style (as opposed to using the SVG fill= attribute).Note that to style an SVG via CSS from within an HTML document, the SVG has to be embedded within the HTML of the page, i.e. it doesn't work by embedding it via <object> or <img> in HTML or via background-image etc. in CSS.When it's embedded within your HTML, you can then style all its elements like you style HTML elements using a CSS selector to match the element(s) you want to style and applying the appropriate styles to it. Besides fill there is a bunch of other SVG attributes, which are also CSS properties. A list of them can be found in the SVG specification or on MDN.In order for a transition to work, both the start and the end value have to be defined in CSS. So, instead of defining the fill color via the fill attribute (fill="#FAFAFA"), it needs to be defined either via the style attribute, which looks like this:or via a CSS rule packed in a <style> element within the SVG:In both cases you can then transition the values via the CSS rule you mentioned.Embedding the SVG within HTML has the advantage that you can do the styling from within the stylesheet you use for your HTML, so you can define styling that are shared between the HTML of your page and the embedded SVG.

I'd like to put an image as the background of a webpage but have it offset by some number of pixels with respect to the center.How can I do this?I want:but instead of 25%, I want something along the lines of "center - 50px". Is there any solution to this?I believe I have a solution that achieves what you're wanting:A background image (specifically a page background) offset by a number of pixels with respect to the center.This works using only HTML & CSS - no javascript required.This can now be easily achieved using background-position and calc as a CSS unit.The following CSS will achieve the same outcome as the previous solution (see "Original Solution" below):Note: Don't use this method if you require support for legacy versions of IE.What this does is moves the the entire container horizontally by the amount specified (in this case to the left 100px). Because the background image is centered relative to the container it moves to the left with the container.The padding fixes the 100px of blank space that would appear to the right of the container as a result of the move. Background images show through padding). Because browsers use the border-box value instead of the default content-box value to calculate background sizing and positioning, the background image is effectively moved back to the right 50px - half the distance of the padding. (Thanks to ErikE for clarification).So your offset/padding must be twice the required offset distance.I have prepared a sample page for you here: 

http://www.indieweb.co.nz/testing/background-offset-center.htmlHave a play with resizing the window. You will see that the purple and blue background image (laid over a deeper background image marking the center of the page) remains exactly 50px (half the offset/padding distance) to the left of the page center.Using background-position: center; is the same as background-position: 50% 50%;.So you can use calc to do some simple math in CSS as a replacement for any length value, for example:Will center the background image, but shift it 50 pixels to the left.So you want it centered by shifted 50 pixels to left. I would add the 50 pixels to the image in the form of a transparent space, unless you are dealing with absolute dimensions. There's no obvious CSS answer. You would either need to use JavaScript to calculate values or do something tricky. You can try keeping the background-position:25% center and adding position:relative;left:-50px or margin-left:-50px but those might not work depending on how you are using the DOM element.The only method I've found for this is to have the background inside another div, then use javascript to reposition ...if you know the width of the image you can use this:Note that you can't have it like that, i.e. you need to calculate (BgWidth - 50) and then write the number there.If you don't know the width you can use Javascript(with-or-without jQuery) and then use this:Nice answer Luke, one more thing, if your block width is larger than screen resolution, your must put your block in another container and do this:My answer gotta be too late but somehow I've found another solution.orThe examples have the same effect.the units need to be the same, so when specifying pixels for the x-position, the y-position needs to be also in pixels.example: EDIT: 

I just re-read your query and the only way to do that is either knowing the absolute position (assuming the outer elements aren't dynamic/flexible), or in case you don't know the position, maybe use javascript to set its position.

Is there an easy way to remove "pseudo-css" without having to overwrite the CSS line by line?Thanks!As far as I can tell there is no other way than to override all properties. The styles are defined on the element, they won't just disappear because of another selector that targets the element.If you only want to remove the pseudo element from the page you can do content: none.Added from comments below:Here content: ""; doesn't affect at all if you want to remove that pseudo you have to use content:none; it will remove previously added pseudo content. If that doesn't help you can also try : if still, it doesn't work then you could try the below, but I never suggest you use !importanthere is working jsfiddlehttps://jsfiddle.net/ganeshswami99/52duu0x8/1/

http://jsfiddle.net/7hy3w2jj/Then you just need this definitionIf you can work with pseudo elements, it can be done with no html at all.

Just add these definition to your text container. http://jsfiddle.net/7287L9a8/The only downside to the pseudo variant is that it only works with one line of text.Div magic to the rescue. In case anyone is interested, you can see the solution here.HTML:CSS:This looks some old question.Now I think there is some good answer with flex.You can do this simply like this:That's it.Hope much help to you!Strange requirement. I would expand the boxes to the texts size.One possible solution might involve a negative text-indent: text-indent: -50px;, but that won't work for smaller texts (first DIV in your example). No better idea here right now.Try instead of:or do you only want it on one line?this one seems to work:

add a wrapper block with position relative and left:50% margin-left:-100% you can see it here

Here's the code:To make the solution work for multi-line text, you can modify Nathan's solution by changing the #inner left from 50% to 25%.Give the innermost div some margin: 0 -50%. If the elements are all display block or inline-block and text alignment is centered, this provides more shoulder room for the innermost element's text. At least, it works for me.

How can I force table to have the same row height of 1em?Here is some markup that reproduces the problem.  Table should only be the height of one line, with the overflowing text hidden.Need to specify two attributes, table-layout:fixed on table and white-space:nowrap; on the cells. You also need to move the overflow:hidden; to the cells tooHere's a Demo . Tested in Firefox 3.5.3 and IE 7 In general, if you are using white-space: nowrap; it is probably because you know which columns are going to contain content which wraps (or stretches the cell). For those columns, I generally wrap the cell's contents in a span with a specific class attribute and apply a specific width.Example:HTML:CSS:In most modern browsers, you can now specify:Then if you apply the styles from the posts above, as follows:The result gives you nicely hidden overflow throughout the table. Works in latest Chrome, Safari, Firefox and IE. I haven't tested in IE prior to 9 - but my guess is that it will work back as far as 7, and you might even get lucky enough to see 5.5 or 6 support. ;)Here´s something I tried. Basically, I put the "flexible" content (the td which contains lines that are too long) in a div container that´s one line high, with hidden overflow. Then I let the text wrap into the invisible. You get breaks at wordbreaks though, not just a smooth cut-off.Just define width of the table and width for each table cellsomething like It works like a charm :o)If javascript is accepted as an answer, I made a jQuery plugin to address this issue (for more information about the issue see CSS: Truncate table cells, but fit as much as possible).To use the plugin just typePlugin: https://github.com/marcogrcr/jquery-tableoverflowFull example: http://jsfiddle.net/Cw7TD/3/embedded/result/wrap the table in a div with class="container"then result

For more info about this property: https://developer.mozilla.org/en/CSS/pointer-events@slicedtoad's comment was hugely useful for me, so I think it deserves a full answer.  If you set pointer-events: none to a parent, you'll disable the events for it's children.  HOWEVER, if you set point-events: auto to the children, they will work again.This also works when the children have a negative z-index, and therefore become unresponsive to pointer-events.

Since .delay() only works within a queue, you need that little workaround.example: http://jsfiddle.net/zceKN/You need to use .queue() because .hide() isn't queued by default.You need a duration on your hide for it to work:Example: http://jsfiddle.net/Paulpro/GLTaB/.delay() works for animations only

Here's an example that assumes the standard custom-file-input with label that is the next sibling element to the input...https://codeply.com/p/LtpNZllirdBootstrap 4.1+Now in Bootstrap 4.1 the "Choose file..." placeholder text is set in the custom-file-label:Changing the "Browse" button text requires a little extra CSS or SASS.

The initial file button (which isn't really a button but looks like one) is set with a CSS pseudo ::before element. These values can be overridden with CSS..2 - How to get the selected filename value, and update the input to show the value.Once a file is selected, the value can be obtained using JavaScript/jQuery.However, since the placeholder text for the input is a pseudo element, there's no easy way to manipulate this with Js/jQuery. You can however, have a another CSS class that hides the pseudo content once the file is selected... Use jQuery to toggle the .selected class on the .custom-file-control once the file is selected. This will hide the initial placeholder value. Then put the filename value in the .form-control-file span...You can then handle the file upload or re-selection as needed.Demo on Codeply (alpha 6)I just solved it this wayHtml:JS:Note: Thanks to ajax333221 for mentioning the .text-truncate class that will hide the overflow within label if the selected file name is too long.As of Bootstrap 4.3 you can change placeholder and button text inside the label tag:For changing the language of the file browser:

As an alternate to what ZimSystem mentioned (override the CSS), a more elegant solution is suggested by the bootstrap docs: build your custom bootstrap styles by adding languages in SCSS

AngularJS team is still working on JS directives for v2.3.1 and will need time to catch up to v3.0.0. I want to start using v3 CSS grid syntax now.https://github.com/angular-ui/bootstrap/issues/331So, the http://angular-ui.github.io/bootstrap/ project does not depend on Bootstrap's JavaScript (it is not wrapping it, not requiring etc.). Those are native AngularJS directives written from the ground-up to be lightweight and well integrated into the AngularJS ecosystem.The only adherence to the Bootstrap project is Bootstrap's markup (HTML) and CSS.If you ask a question "can I grab all the directives and use them with Bootstrap 3.0" the answer is "it depends". It really depends if and how much Bootstrap 3.0 decide do change its markup and corresponding CSS classes. I would presume that markup of some controls have changed and not for some others.Now, the very good news with http://angular-ui.github.io/bootstrap/ is that most of the HTML markup and CSS classes are encapsulated in separate AngularJS templates. In practice it means that you can grab the JavaScript code of the directives and only change markup (templates) to fit into Bootstrap 3.0.All the templates are located here: 

https://github.com/angular-ui/bootstrap/tree/master/template

and by browsing them you should get an idea that it is pretty simple to update markup without messing with JavaScript. This is one of the design goals of this project.I would encourage you to simply give it a try and see how CSS of Bootstrap 3.0 works with the existing directives and templates. If you spot any issues you can always update templates to Bootstrap 3.0 (and contribute them back to the project!)There's a pull request pending that contains fixes for most of the issues with Bootstrap 3.0 and the AngularUi directives:https://github.com/angular-ui/bootstrap/pull/742Just to give you an alternative: willing to integrate Angular JS and Boostrap 3 for mobile development I've tried to overcome the bootstrap.js integration in a different way.Instead to attempt to reproduce bootstrap.js behaviour exactly component by component, I basically made two general purpose directives communicating each other through events to sync the active/inactive state of two or more DOM nodes. Reflecting state trough classes makes them capable to reproduce almost all of the basic bootstrap.js components interaction.So for the most common applications you'll need only the bootstap 3 css and these few lines of js to get almost all of boostrap 3 functionalities. You can grab the code here, it will work outside the project and you can adapt it to fit your needs: https://github.com/mcasimir/mobile-angular-ui/blob/master/src/coffee/directives/toggle.coffee. It's Coffeescript but you can easily translate it to js through js2coffee.org.You may also want to read the docs here: http://mobileangularui.com/#toc6.This is a simple example to show the basics of how it works:And this is how you can use them to create Tabs component:As a plus you can also control the same tabs from different nodes:Don't know if this can fit your needs but this way you can create at least: tabs, accordions, collapsibles, modals and dropdowns without the need of a dedicated library. Also note that it will work either with bootstrap 2 and 3 since it not depends on bootstrap markup at all.

From an answer to a similar question I found elsewhere:But for now it looks like you'd have to add the <span> to your html.To expand a bit on what others said, as well as additional question clarifications, there is no built-in way of doing this from CSS w/o touching the HTML. If you are looking to keep the HTML as clean and semantic as possible, I would do the styling using javascript, probably with a library like jQuery, to adjust the DOM so that the css can be more effective.I would caution, however, using color to convey info. I'm not sure what the purpose of the  colored numbers is, but using color to display information leaves colorblind users out of the loop and is a big no no for accessibility.too bad you can't edit the html... how about js? if not, maybe a good-enough solution would behtml:css:It's a bit late for this but I want to share it with the community, took me a long while to do this.

I'm currently working on a site, and somewhere in my mass of stylesheets, something is killing performance in IE.  Are there any good CSS profilers out there?  I'd like a tool that can pinpoint rules that are killing performance.Before you ask, I've disabled JavaScript, opacity, and box-shadow/text-shadow rules.  The page is still jumpy.  :/  If I disable all CSS, it runs great.  I need a tool that can profile the page and report where the CSS bottlenecks are.So, I finally got around to writing a JavaScript function that indexed all of my CSS classes on the page and then individually toggled them, while scrolling the page.  This immediately pin-pointed the errant class, and from there, I was able to determine errant property.  Turns out that border-radius on an element that contains many children (e.g. a body level div) performs incredibly poorly on IE9.I've started a github repo for my CSS stress test: https://github.com/andyedinborough/stress-cssFrom there, you can install a bookmarklet to easily run the test on any page.The Page Speed plugin from Google has a section that analyses your CSS and tells you about inefficient selectors, perhaps start there?hthNote: I know its a Firefox plugin, but should help optimize a bit :)Hmm, never heard of such a tool. If you find none, things to look out for manually will includeI would strongly suspect the first point - alpha transparencies can be a terrible rendering bottleneck, especially on older systems.I also have performance problems on a web project I'm currently working on. It runs well in Firefox, Chrome, even IE8. In IE9 it bogs down.After some detective work I discovered that eliminating all box-shadow CSS lines improved performance considerably. I had shadows from banners, tables, boxes and tabs, each with just a subtle amount of shadow and blur, but apparently enough for IE9 to get all moody.The Chrome dev tools used to contain a CSS Selector Profiler for doing just this sort of thing. You can see screen shots of it in this blog post.The Chrome team pulled the feature in Chrome 30 stating that:You could try to use an old version of Chrome to dig into the issue, but I'd recommend taking a look at the Timeline tab of the current version of Chrome dev tools with will show you how long Chrome has taken to calculate styles (where selector performance is affected), layout and paint the page.Opera is experimenting with css profiling in its profiler.It can be enabled following the steps on this page.

Then open the profiler, start profiling, and refresh the page you wish to analyze.

Stop profiling after rendering finishes, then the results will be shown.

Try this, it's simple and clear. I have found it from here : https://css-tricks.com/tinted-images-multiple-backgrounds/

I have a table TD and on the right of it I want to add a 1 pixel border, so I've done this:It works fine but the problem is that the border's height takes the total TD's height.Is there a way to set the height of the border?No, there isn't. The border will always be as tall as the element.You can achieve the same effect by wrapping the contents of the cell in a <span>, and applying height/border styles to that. Or by drawing a short vertical line in an 1 pixel wide PNG which is the correct height, and applying it as a background to the cell:I have another possibility. This is of course a "newer" technique, but for my projects works sufficient.It only works if you need one or two borders. I've never done it with 4 borders... and to be honest, I don't know the answer for that yet.I hope this helps you too, as for me, this is an easy workaround.Yes, you can set the line height after defining the border like this:For td elements line-height will successfully allow you to resize the border-height as SPrince mentioned. For other elements such as list items, you can control the border height with line-height and the height of the actual element with margin-top and margin-bottom. Here is a working example of both:

http://jsfiddle.net/byronj/gLcqu6mg/An example with list items:No, you cannot set the border height. Then with your code you can:Hope that helps!Currently, no, not without resorting to trickery. borders on elements are supposed to run the entire length of whatever side of the element box they apply to.//draws a line on right side of the box.

later add a margin-top and margin-bottom.

i.e.,This might help in drawing a line on the right-side of the box with a gap on top and bottom.Mods:Good Luck...This will add a centered border to the left of the cell that is 80% the height of the cell. You can reference the full border-image documentation here.Just like everyone else said, you can't control border height. 

But there are workarounds, here's what I do:You can set height to inherit for the height of the table or calc(inherit - 2px) for a 2px smaller border.

Remember, inherit has no effect when the table height isn't set.Use height: 50% for half a border.DemoJust you add height under the border property.

(you'll have to re-run the code to reset it)I don't know quite how to remedy this one...Any ideas? Just move the entire modal outside of the rest of your code, to the very bottom. It doesn't need to be nested in any other element, other than the body.DemoThey hint at this solution in the documentation.Although the z-index of the .modal is higher than that of the .modal-backdrop, that .modal is in a parent div #content-wrap which has a lower z-index than .modal-backdrop (z-index: 1002 vs z-index: 1030).Because the parent has lower z-index than the .modal-backdrop everything in it will be behind the modal, irrespective of any z-index given to the children.If you remove the z-index you have set on both the body div#fullContainer #content-wrap and also on the #ctrlNavPanel, everything seems to work ok.NOTE:  I think that you may have initially used z-indexes on the #content-wrap and #ctrlNavPanel to ensure the nav sits behind, but that's not necessary because the nav element comes before the content-wrap in the HTML, so you only need to position them, not explicitly set a stacking order.EDIT

As Schmalzy picked up on, the links are no longer clickable.  This is because the full-container is 100% wide and so covers the navigation.  The quickest way to fix this is to place the navigation inside that div:DEMO HEREIn my case, I could fix it by adding css for the .modal-backdropAlthough this works, form controls still seem to appear above the backdrop, clicking anywhere dismisses the modal, but it doesn't look great.A better workaround for me is to bind to the shown event (once the page is loaded) and to correct the z-index property.In this case, if you are OK with changing the DOM on modal shown:None of the answers worked well enough for me.

The problem appeared to lie where the modal windows needs to be outside of the body.and it is not bestSo this code done the job just prefectly:I'm wary of moving the modal content outside its original context: other JS or styles might depend on that context.However, I doubt there are any scripts or styles that require a specific context for the backdrop. So my solution is to move the backdrop adjacent to the modal content, forcing it into the same stacking context:It's only a slight deviation from jacoswarts' solution, so thanks for the inspiration!I was fighting with the same problem some days... I found three posible solutions, but i dont know, which is the most optimal, if somebody tell me, i will be grateful.the modifications will be in bootstrap.cssOption 1: Option 2:Option 3:I used the option 2.In my case one of parents of my modal was animated and had thisThe blocker here is animation-fill-mode: both;. I could not just move modal outside, so the solution was to override 'animation-fill-mode' to animation-fill-mode: none;. Animation still worked fine.Try remove the backdrop, if you don't realy need it (data-backdrop= "false"):Another resolution for this problem is to add z-index: 0; to .modal-backdrop class in your bootstrap-dialog.css file if you don't want to modify bootstrap.css.if we cannot delete backdrop and/or we have component framework such angular or vue we cannot move modal to the root. i did this trick: put my custom modal-backdrop container(with aditional class) as sibling for modal-dialog  container and added some cssand cssYou could use this : For those using ASP.NET MVC,Needing to move the modal div just before the </body> tag but can't do it because you are using a Layout pageDefine a section in you _Layout.cshtml file just before the body tag, eg:Then in your viewThis way, the modal HTML will be rendered before the body tag and the modal now should be displayed correctly..just remove z-index: 1040; from this file bootstrap.css class .modal-backdropI was missing the follow html <div class="modal fade" tabindex="-1" role="dialog" aria-labelledby="myModalLabel">added it and worked without problemsSince I don't have the chance to move the modal markup since i added it in a partial template within a conditional what worked for me is add CSS bellowThen, when boostrap add class "in" through js apply display: block and everything works fine.I Found that applying ionic framework (ionic.min.cs) after bootstrap coursing this issue for me.If you can't put the modal to the root (if your use angular and the modal is in a controller for example), modifying bootstrap or using js is obviously a bad solution.so saying you have your website structure:open your code inspector and move the modal to the root, it should be working (but no where you want):now put it in the first div and check if it's working: if yes check the next child until it's not working and find the div that is the problem;Once you know which div is the problem you can play with the css display and position to make it work.everyone has a different structure but in my case setting a parent to display: table; was the solutionPut this code wherever you wantMany times , you cannot move the modal outside as this affects your design structure.The reason the backdrop comes above your modal is id the parent has any position set. A very simple way to solve the problem other then moving your modal outside is move the backdrop inside structure were you have your modal. In your case, it could beNote that this solution is applicable if you have a definite strucure for your application and you cant just move the modal outside as it will go against the design structurejust move your modal outside of all div contents, place it mostly prior to closing of body.First make sure the modal is not in any parent div.

Then add 

$('#myModal').appendTo("body")It worked fine for me.In Addition to all answers here, i found out, that the bootstrap4 "animated fadeIn" is also causing this error (not clickable modal behind background):check if your modal is in the following parent tag (bootstrap animation)<div class="animated fadeIn"></div>I removed this tag - solved the problem for me.If you use JQuery, you can use the appendTo() to append the modal to a specific element, in this case, the , in most case, a simple one line can move your modal on top of the backdrop regardless where your modal div's positionhere's the reference of the JQuery appendTo function:

http://api.jquery.com/appendto/I updated it to your fiddle

http://jsfiddle.net/ZBQ8U/240/this works for me.i encountred this problem, and after investigating my css, the main container (direct child of the body) had: the backdrop worked well after i removed those two properties. You may also encounter this problem if the main wraper have a position: fixedI had a similar problem  that the fade was not working and the overlay stayed on the page.

I had dynamic content added back to the page (refresh on some content only on modal action).

I also had this $('#rejectModal-'+itemId).modal('hide') (itemId is dynamic id for multiple modals in a single page for rejecting some information) but the problem was still not gone.The overlay was staying because my layout was not set to null in the partial view

After setting this the problem was gone:Just remove the backdrop, insert this code in your css file

I just want enough CSS for the Modal to work.  (I tried going thru the CSS file and just guessing what I needed, but it didn't work).Update as of Bootstrap v3.2.5Thanks to @Gruber for confirmation as of v3.2.5.The link is still here, to customize the setup as mentioned by @Fisu.You need to select 4 options though, not just modal as stated. Start by clicking Toggle All to turn everything off, then select these 4 options; This should bring all of the CSS over that you'll need. Next is the jQuery plugins section, again start by selecting Toggle All to turn everything off and then just select two plugins:That's all you'll need, js (bootstrap.min.js) and css (only bootstrap.css which you'll need to modify a bit, explained below).  Go to the bottom of that page and select compile and download to grab your package.One final thing to note.  As @Rrrrrrrrrk mentioned, "I found it still added a lot of normalization to the start of the css, but could safely delete it (from html to img, keeping the css from .img-responsive onwards)."  This is still valid.  I also added the following css to force a few styles into the Modals:This just ensures fonts are similar to the original modal styling and don't take on your pages styles (could probably be tweaked a bit more). One final item to note, you could minify the css at this point by running it through http://cssminifier.com/.  Saves a few KB.Implementing the Modal:I might as well just finish this off.  I'm using a cookie plugin because I want to give my users an option to hide the message for 14 days, which is set in the code.  Here are the code blocks you'll need:This should go in the <head> of you document, probably after any of your css, so even just before the ending </head> tag will work.This should go within your <body>.  This will create the modal and the css you've included will hide it.This code should go just before the ending </body> tag.  It loads jQuery, bootstrap, and the cookie plugin I need.Finally, you'll want to add this script after the plugins above.  This is a bit customized to my situation, I'm only launching the modal if there is no cookie set, and if the modal launches created a function to click Don't Show Again which creates the cookie to disable the launch of the modal.Hope this helps!  Good luck.Go to the Bootstrap customize section and select just the modal option in the components section. Download the file, open the bootstrap.css file and copy the entire contents into your own CSS file.If you try to work out which specific parts you need you'll likely miss something important, and besides, the modal css on its own is not too big.Update:

The link is now here.

It is working... Here JSBINThe best way to do this is strictly separate your table into two different tables - header and body:If your table has a big width (more than screen width), then you have to add scroll events for horizontal scrolling header and body synchroniously.You should never touch table tags (table, tbody, thead, tfoot, tr) with CSS properties display and overflow.

Preserve line breaks in textarea

I have a form with a textarea and I want to preserve line breaks entered by the user when outputting the content.For exemple, if I write in textarea : I want the same output and not : How could I preserve line breaks?

2015-06-02 10:08:32Z

I have a form with a textarea and I want to preserve line breaks entered by the user when outputting the content.For exemple, if I write in textarea : I want the same output and not : How could I preserve line breaks?Generally you just need to addto the element's style (CSS), where you want your text rendered with line-breaks.The line breaks the user entered are preserved, neither html nor php simply drops or alters anything. However html markup, when rendered for visualization uses a different way to code line breaks. There are very good reasons for that. So what you have to do is "translate" the existing line breaks into html style line breaks. How to do that depends on the environment you are working under. In general you have to translate line break codes like \n to <br> tags. The php scripting language offers a function for this for example: nl2br()However take care: this only applies when rendering the text as html markup. This does not apply, when you output the text into a textarea inside a form again to allow changing it for example. In that case you have to preserve the original line breaks just as received. So what you typically do is: you save the unaltered text input as received. When outputting that text again to a client, say after reading it from a database where you have saved it before, then you know the situation, how the text will be presented. That is when you either translate or leave the existing line breaks as they are. You could also encode unaltered text containing line breaks by <pre>...</pre> tags, so mark them as to be rendered as preformatted. THis is for example done when displaying source code in html pages. You can do:You keep output in textarea as it is. You would receive input as a string output that string(write to file) that string adding textarea to the input string.

Leaving out the last semicolon of a CSS block

[Leaving out the last semicolon of a CSS block](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11939595/leaving-out-the-last-semicolon-of-a-css-block)

A couple of questions concerning this:What I mean is stuff like this:

2012-08-13 17:52:37Z

A couple of questions concerning this:What I mean is stuff like this:It's not good practice to manually exclude semicolons. This is purely because it's easy to overlook when adding more styles, especially if you're working in a team:Imagine you start with:And then someone adds some styles:Suddenly the other developer is wasting time figuring out why their width declaration isn't working (or worse yet, doesn't notice that it's not working). It's safer to leave the semi-colons in.Most definitely, for every block, you'd save a couple of bytes. These add up, especially for large style sheets. Instead of worrying about these performance gains yourself, it's better to use a CSS compressor, such as the YUI Compressor to automatically remove the ending semi-colons for you.No, it's safe, as browsers implement this part of the specification correctly. The CSS2 specification defines a declaration thusly:More importantly:This means that ; is used to separate multiple declarations, but it is not needed to terminate them.JavaScript is a whole different beast with a completely different specification. This particular question has been answered in depth many times before on Stack Overflow.In my opinion, no. If you add a rule below the last rule, it's easy to forget to add the semicolon.Can't imagine that it would make much of a difference in load time.No, semicolons are only required to separate rules in CSS blocks. Semicolons are delimiters, not terminators.Yes, don't leave it up the the JavaScript interpreter to add semicolons.It will improve the loading time ever so slightly. With a large enough CSS file(s), it can even be noticeable (well, minification overall can be; I doubt just removing the final semicolon will ever be enough).If you care that much about the loading times, however, you should be using a program to minify your CSS, not manually attempting to do it. Minified CSS is (all but) impossible to read. It's a bad practice to use this in the "source code" so to speak, because it's all too easy to forget it.This is a duplicate question.  See here:Semicolon in CSSRegarding applying a semi-colon in JavaScript, functions should not end with semicolons unless they are assigned declaratively, viz. var a = function() {};  However, browsers perform automatic semi-colon insertion if you inadvertently (or purposely) leave them out.Removing declaration stops will not "break" the browsers but should still be left for automated minifiers (especially if you're concerned with loading times - semicolons alone would not add up to much) but should be avoided in the source for maintainability reasons.If you are looking for best practices, CSS formatting rules in the Google css styleguide is a very good place to start - not to blindly apply their suggestion but to see their reasoning behind it.Javascript is a different story though - the short answer is always use semicolons, never rely on implicit insertion, but I've never seen an answer better and more thorough than as prescribed by Google in yet another styleguide of theirs:I'd shy away from it as a smart minification process will handle this for you and it'd introduce errors if you forgot to place the semi-colon when adding new definitions.Yes, smaller file size. Though, the difference is negligible and minification processes will automatically do this.NoNo, it'd be "invalid" to exclude semi-colons at the end of a function statement.Based on my experience, 1) It is not good practice 2) Even on a very large scale load times will be insignificant. 3) Not aware of any browser that would break from this. 4) Same true for jQueryFor CSS, I tried this out on IE9, FF, GC, Safari, and Opera, and it didn't make a difference.As for Javascript, I got an error on FF and GC, so I would say don't do this on scripts. As for load time, the difference will not be in any way noticeable.

I have attempted a number of the suggestions found online already such as setting 'float' to left and such - yet none of these have worked when it comes to fixing the problem.Currently I am unsure of what is causing this issue, how would I go about and resolve it?I've noticed a lot of people are using this answer so I decided to update it a little bit. If you want to see the original answer, check below. The new answer demonstrates how you can add some style to your list.This fiddle shows howhttp://jsfiddle.net/9th7X/Great references on lists and css here:http://alistapart.com/article/taminglists/A much better way is to use inline-block, because you don't need to use clear:both at the end of your list anymore.Try this:CSS:Have a look at it here : http://jsfiddle.net/shahverdy/4N6Ap/You could also use inline blocks to avoid floating elementsand then style as:that way you wont need to float anything, eliminating the need for clearfixesHere you can find a working example, with some more suggestions about dynamic resizing of the list.I've used display:inline-block and a percentage padding so that the parent list can dynamically change size:plus two more rules to remove padding for the first and last items.

how to properly display an iFrame in mobile safari

[how to properly display an iFrame in mobile safari](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5267996/how-to-properly-display-an-iframe-in-mobile-safari)

I'm trying to display an iframe in my mobile web application, but I'm having trouble restricting the size of the iframe to the dimensions of the iPhone screen. The height and width attributes on the iframe element seem to have no effect, strangely.

I'm trying to display an iframe in my mobile web application, but I'm having trouble restricting the size of the iframe to the dimensions of the iPhone screen. The height and width attributes on the iframe element seem to have no effect, strangely. Surrounding it with a div manages to constrain it, but then I'm unable to scroll within the iframe.Has anyone tackled iframes in mobile safari before? Any ideas where to start?Yeah, you can't constrain the iframe itself with height and width.  You should put a div around it.  If you control the content in the iframe, you can put some JS within the iframe content that will tell the parent to scroll the div when the touch event is received.  like this:The JS:The HTML:If you don't control the iframe content, you can use an overlay over the iframe in a similar manner, but then you can't interact with the iframe contents other than to scroll it - so you can't, for example, click links in the iframe.It used to be that you could use two fingers to scroll within an iframe, but that doesn't work anymore.Update: iOS 6 broke this solution for us. I've been attempting to get a new fix for it, but nothing has worked yet.  In addition, it is no longer possible to debug javascript on the device since they introduced Remote Web Inspector, which requires a Mac to use.If the iFrame content is not yours then the solution below will not work.With Android all you need to do is to surround the iframe with a DIV and set the height on the div to document.documentElement.clientHeight.  IOS, however, is a different animal.  Although I have not yet tried Sharon's solution it does seem like a good solution.  I did find a simpler solution but it only works with IOS 5.+.Surround your iframe element with a DIV (lets call it scroller), set the height of the DIV and make sure that the new DIV has the following styling:This alone will work but you will notice that in most implementations the content in the iframe goes blank when scrolling and is basically rendered useless. My understanding is that this behavior has been reported as a bug to Apple as early as iOS 5.0. To get around that problem, find the body element in the iframe and add -webkit-transform', 'translate3d(0, 0, 0) like so:If your app or iframe is heavy on memory usage you might get a hitchy scroll for which you might need to use Sharon's solution.This only works if you control both the outside page and the iframe page.On the outside page, make the iframe unscrollable.On the iframe page, add this.This works because modern browsers uses html to determine the height, so we just give that a fixed height and turn the body into a scrollable node.I have put @Sharon's code together into the following, which works for me on the iPad with two-finger scrolling. The only thing you should have to change to get it working is the src attribute on the iframe (I used a PDF document).I'm building my first site and this helped me get this working for all sites that I use iframe embededding for. Thanks!Sharon's method worked for me, however when a link in the iframe is followed and then the browser back button is pressed, the cached version of the page is loaded and the iframe is no longer scrollable.  To overcome this I used some code to refresh the page as follows:I implemented the following and it works well.  Basically, I set the body dimensions according to the size of the iFrame content.  It does mean that our non-iFrame menu can be scrolled off the screen, but otherwise, this makes our sites functional with iPad and iPhone.  "workbox" is the ID of our iFrame.Purely using MSchimpf and Ahmad's code, I made adjustments so I could have the iframe within a div, therefore keeping a header and footer for back button and branding on my page. Updated code:and the htmlDon't scroll the IFrame page or its content, scroll the parent page. If you control the IFrame content, you can use the iframe-resizer library to turn the iframe element itself into a proper block level element, with a natural/correct/native height. Also, don't attempt to position (fixed, absolute) your iframe in the parent page, or present an iframe in a modal window, especially if it has form elements.I also suspect that iOS Safari has a non-standards behavior that expands your iframe's height to its natural height, much like the iframe-resizer library will do for desktop browsers, which seem to render responsive iframe content at height 0px or 150px or some other not useful default. If you need to contrain width, try a max-width style inside the iframe.The solution is to use Scrolling="no" on the iframe.That's it.

How can i get every styles (even inherited) from an element A to an element B ? in javascript or using jquery.let's tell i have an element <p class="foo">...</p> and i append new element <div /> which would look like the same, except content.If you don't care about IE, then you can do this:This works for inline, embedded, and inherited styles.EDIT: And by "don't care about IE," I of course meant "don't care about anything except Webkit."UPDATE: This works in the current versions of Chrome(19), Safari(5), Firefox(12), and IE(9). It also works in older versions of some, such as IE8.Actually, sdleihssirhc's answer will not work on firefox as getComputedStyle(p, "").cssText will return an empty string, it's a longstanding and know bug: https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=137687The solution to also support Firefox is to iterate on getComputedStyle properties and create the CSS string manually:Try to copy every CSS-properties like this:Why not? you can create the dictionary that may consists of all properties.

What would be the best method to code heading/title of <ul> or <ol>? Like we have <caption> in <table>, and we don't want to make them bold.Is this okay?Or should headings always be used?Though this is old, I'm updating it for others who might find this question when searching later.@Matt Kelliher:Using the css :before and a data-* attribute for the list is a great idea, but can be modified slightly to be more handicap accessible as well:HTML:CSS:This will make a list with the "header" pseudo element above it with text set to the value in the aria-label attribute. You can then easily style it to your needs.  The benefit of this over using a data-* attribute is that aria-label will be read off by screen readers as a "label" for the list, which is semantically correct for your intended use of this data.Note: IE8 supports :before attributes, but must use the single colon version (and must have a valid doctype defined).  IE7 does not support :before, but Modernizer or Selectivizr should fix that issue for you.  All modern browsers support the older :before syntax, but prefer that the ::before syntax be used.  Generally the best way to handle this is to have an external stylesheet for IE7/8 that uses the old format and a general stylesheet using the new format, but in practice, most just use the old single colon format since it is still 100% cross browser, even if not technically valid for CSS3.Always use heading tags for headings. The clue is in the name :)If you don’t want them to be bold, change their style with CSS. For example:In HTML5, you can associate the heading and the list more clearly by using the <section> element. (<section> doesn’t work properly in IE 8 and earlier without some JavaScript though.)You could do something similar in HTML 4:Then style thus:I like to make use of the css :before and a data-* attribute for the listHTML:CSS:This will make a list with the header on it that is whatever text is specified as the list's data-header attribute. You can then easily style it to your needs.how about making the heading a list-element with different styles like soand the CSSadditionally, use a reset CSS to set margins and paddings right on the ul and li. here's a good reset CSS. once you've reset the margins and paddings, you can apply some margin on the list-elements other than the one's with the heading class, to indent them.Would the use of <caption> be allowed?h3 is absolutly a better solution than h2, h1 or h6 !Therefore, using Hn is probably one of the best solution, but surely not a specific level.

CSS Div width percentage and padding without breaking layout

[CSS Div width percentage and padding without breaking layout](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3538875/css-div-width-percentage-and-padding-without-breaking-layout)

There may be a simple fix for this, but it has troubled me for ages now...  Let me explain the situation. I have a div with the ID 'container' that holds all the contents in the page (including header and footer also) that will keep everything inline and I can do just 1 simple 'margin:0 auto;' instead of multiples. So lets say that I have the width of #container set to 80%. Now if I put another div inside with the same width (80%) and give it the ID of 'header' with 10px of padding all around, the layout would "break" (so to speak) because the page adds the padding amount onto the width. So, how can I make it stay in-bounds without using methods such as a lower percentage for the #header div? Basically, I want to make it fluid.  Here is some example code to give you an idea of what I am talking about...  CSSHTMLCan anyone help me out with this issue that has been bugging me forever?

Here is some example code to give you an idea of what I am talking about...  CSSHTMLCan anyone help me out with this issue that has been bugging me forever?If you want the #header to be the same width as your container, with 10px of padding, you can leave out its width declaration.  That will cause it to implicitly take up its entire parent's width (since a div is by default a block level element).  Then, since you haven't defined a width on it, the 10px of padding will be properly applied inside the element, rather than adding to its width:You can see it in action here.  The key when using percentage widths and pixel padding/margins is not to define them on the same element (if you want to accurately control the size).  Apply the percentage width to the parent and then the pixel padding/margin to a display: block child with no width set.UpdateAnother option for dealing with this is to use the box-sizing CSS rule:Here's a post talking about how box-sizing works.You can also use the CSS calc() function to subtract the width of your padding from the percentage of your container's width.An example:Just be sure to make the subtracted width equal to the total padding, not just one half. If you pad both sides of the inner div with 16px, then you should subtract 32px from the final width, assuming that the example below is what you want to achieve.Try removing the position from header and add overflow to container:

This solution will take into account the how far the window has scrolled, and moves the div when you scrolled past your header.  It will then lock it back into place when you get to the top again.

I think the following is what you want:For anyone using Bootstrap 3 and trying to get nice looking alerts:The solution provided by RickB works only on manually added errors on (String.Empty key) but not on those generated by ModelState (normally this gets triggered first via javascript but it's always a good practice to have a fallback if (for example) the Html.ValidationMessageFor is missing or many other situations.Alternative solution. =) I did not like how the ValidationSummary rendered using a bullet list (unordered list). It had a lot of unnecessary space below the error list. A solution to that issue - is simply to loop through the errors and render the errors how you want. I used paragraphs. For example:The result, in my case, looks something like this:

Consider writing an extension method to the HtmlHelper like:Then you just need to fit the ul-li styling in your stylesheet.In MVC 5, ViewData.ModelState[""] always returned a null value. I had to resort to the IsValid command.I took a slightly different route: using JQuery to hook into the form submit:I have this set inside a self-executing javascript module so that it hooks onto any validation summaries that I create.HTHChuckYou can use jquery:It is looking for every div containing given error classes from bootstrap and writing html at beginning of the div. I am adding .alert-block class as the bootstrap page says:Alternative solution with pure javascript (jQuery). I'm working with MVC4 + Bootstrap3 but it works perfect for you.If you don't want to write server side logic then is a nice alternative solution.TwitterBootstrapMVC takes care of this one with just one line:Important, to assure that it behaves the same during the server side and client side (unobtrissive) validation, you need to include a javaScript file that takes care of that.You can customize your Validation helper with extension methods however you see fit.Disclaimer: I'm the author of TwitterBootstrapMVC. Using it with Bootstrap 3 requires a license.This solution uses Sass to make it work but you could achieve the same thing with basic css. To make this work with client side validation we cant rely on checking the ModelState since that assumes a postback has occurred. The out-of-the-box mvc client side validation already makes things visible at the right time so let it do its thing and simply style the list items in the validation summary to render like bootstrap alerts.Razor markup:SassThe css that produced for my project looked like this - yours will be different:Expanding upon Daniel Björk's solution you can include a little script to adjust the CSS included with ValidationSummary() output.  The resulting  bootstrap alert was showing a rendering issue until I removed the validation-summary-errors class.You can also easily give a bootstrap highlight to fields with errors.  See http://chadkuehn.com/convert-razor-validation-summary-into-bootstrap-alert/To achieve the same in bootstrap 4, use the following:If it needs to work with clientside javascript I suggests doing this:You still can assign the bootstrap class  but it will only show when you have actual errors.Based on the answers here: (I'm using Bootstrap 4)

It works on Chrome on Android even when keyboard drawer is active. If someone wants to test iPhone that would be cool:Here is the magic.

How can we apply Photoshop-like font anti-aliasing such as crisp, sharp, strong, smooth in CSS?Are these supported by all browsers?here you go Sir :-)12Short answer: You can't.CSS does not have techniques which affect the rendering of fonts in the browser; only the system can do that.Obviously, text sharpness can easily be achieved with pixel-dense screens, but if you're using a normal PC that's gonna be hard to achieve.There are some newer fonts that are smooth but at the sacrifice of it appearing somewhat blurry (look at most of Adobe's fonts, for example). You can also find some smooth-but-blurry-by-design fonts at Google Fonts, however.There are some new CSS3 techniques for font rendering and text effects though the consistency, performance, and reliability of these techniques vary so largely to the point where you generally shouldn't rely on them too much.Works the best. If you want to use it sitewide, without having to add this syntax to every class or ID, add the following CSS to your css body:

Creating a DIV that uses CSS to draw a triangle to the left.  Trying to apply a uniform box-shadow to both parent and the pseudo element (see images) and code.Is this possible? Or am I better off using border-image for this?(Top: Before Shadow, Middle: CSS Box-Shadow, Bottom: Desired Result)Instead of using a triangle hack, you can just rotate a div using transform and get a real box-shadow. Since you only want the shadow on one side of the div (the visible triangle side), you have to make the blur smaller and lower the opacity.Demo: http://jsfiddle.net/ThinkingStiff/mek5Z/HTML:CSS:Output:Here is a complete working example in full (S)CSS, with

variables for nose size shadow width and an optional border.The trick is to get the offsets and transform right to achieve pixel-perfection, and to use overflow:hidden as necessary to cut the nose of your bubble (especially if you need borders).The example in the answer above doesn't work for us because the shadow gets cropped and is laid over the main bubble area.Degrades gracefully in IE7/8.HTML:SCSS:I know It's a little bit tricky but, seems nice to me. 

Here is the fiddle http://jsfiddle.net/dzfj6/HTMLCSSInstead of box-shadow, you can simply use border for buble.Another solution is to use filter: drop-shadow(0 1px 2px rgba(0,0,0,.5)); It only places the shadow around the objects shape. Don't use box-shadow.

CSS hide all images with matching SRC attribute

[CSS hide all images with matching SRC attribute](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6763899/css-hide-all-images-with-matching-src-attribute)

Is it possible to create a CSS rule that would apply a style to any IMG tag with a SRC that contained a specific string, say "hideme"?  For instance, if I had the following 3 images on a page it would hide the second one?

flex-wrap not working as expected in Safari

[flex-wrap not working as expected in Safari](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/29986668/flex-wrap-not-working-as-expected-in-safari)

On the homepage of http://www.shopifyexperte.de/ there are two flex-box modules, one under "Kundenstimmen" and one under "Neueste Beiträge...". The inner boxes are supposed to wrap when they go below 220px and not grow above 30% width. This works in latest Chrome, FF and Opera (all on Mac), but in Safari 8.0.5 (Mac) and any iOS browser the boxes never form a row even if there's enough room. They always wrap, each one on a row of its own.The CSS for the container:The CSS for the boxes inside the container:If I disable -webkit-flex-wrap (effectively setting it to nowrap), all boxes line up in a row but eventually overflow the container when the browser window gets too narrow.Is this some kind of bug in Safari/Webkit or am I doing something wrong here?

In a separate issue, I tested using the min-width in place of auto in lines where you say something like -webkit-flex: 1 1 auto;.This question has some info: https://stackoverflow.com/a/30792851/756329Set child elements like this seems to work for meI had a similar issue in Safari (9.1.3) with the Bootstrap 3 grid system (e.g. col-md-4) in combination with flex. I solved it by setting margin: 0 -1px; on the col items and flex-wrap: wrap; on the wrapper.I'm using Safari 11.0.1 and the bug persists. I use Bootstrap 3 combined with display: flex on my .row elements. I added following to my css to target the column elements. There seems to be something about the width percentages in Safari that aren't being honored correctly.Setting flex-basis: 20em also works, min-width: 20em does not.This is indeed a Safari bug. The details are available at the excellent flexbugs page, but to quote it:So the fix / workaround - as suggested by other answers here - is to set the flex-basis to an explicit width rather than auto.I just ran into this issue again and used 'flex-flow'. Worked like a charm.

I am NOT talking about zooming the page, but rather the way MobileSafari on iOS automatically bumps up some font sizes sometimes.When, exactly, is this done? Can it be prevented or discouraged?

I am NOT talking about zooming the page, but rather the way MobileSafari on iOS automatically bumps up some font sizes sometimes.When, exactly, is this done? Can it be prevented or discouraged?Just make sure all your text is at a legible size in the first place. The iPhone and iPod touch have a rather small screen, so keep that in mind too.Had a lot of trouble tracking it down, but: it’s the -webkit-text-size-adjust property in CSS.Read more about it and other iOS-specific CSS here.Values:Note that these can be applied not just at the page level but at the element/widget/container level.(I would not just specify a value of 100% for my website unless I was damn sure it was already optimized for small screens, and never none since it causes problems.)Please note that in Firefox Mobile (e.g. for Android and Firefox OS) there is a similar property, -moz-text-size-adjust, documented here. Thanks to Costa for pointing this out.Apparently Microsoft also has a version of this for mobile IE: -ms-text-size-adjust.The accepted answer works, but in other webkit browsers it locks in the font-size for people that are zooming. Using 100% instead of none works both ways:
