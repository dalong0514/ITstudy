I have a csv file which isn't coming in correctly with pandas.read_csv when I  filter the columns with usecols and use multiple indexes.

I expect that df1 and df2 should be the same except for the missing dummy column, but the columns come in mislabeled.  Also the date is getting parsed as a date.  Using column numbers instead of names give me the same problem.  I can workaround the issue by dropping the dummy column after the read_csv step, but I'm trying to understand what is going wrong.  I'm using pandas 0.10.1.edit: fixed bad header usage.The answer by @chip completely misses the point of two keyword arguments.This solution corrects those oddities:Which gives us:This code achieves what you want --- also its weird and certainly buggy:I observed that it works when:a) you specify the index_col rel. to the number of columns you really use -- so its three columns in this example, not four (you drop dummy and start counting from then onwards)b) same for parse_datesc) not so for usecols ;) for obvious reasonsd) here I adapted the names to mirror this behaviourwhich printsIf your csv file contains extra data, columns can be deleted from the DataFrame after import.

I've seen many solutions with iloc or ix but here, I need to use a boolean condition.just use replace:What you're trying is called chain indexing: http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/indexing.html#indexing-view-versus-copyYou can use loc to ensure you operate on the original dF:While using replace seems to solve the problem, I would like to propose an alternative. Problem with mix of numeric and some string values in the column not to have strings replaced with np.nan, but to make whole column proper. I would bet that original column most likely is of an object typeWhat you really need is to make it a numeric column (it will have proper type and would be quite faster), with all non-numeric values replaced by NaN.Thus, good conversion code would beSpecify errors='coerce' to force strings that can't be parsed to a numeric value to become NaN. Column type would beYou can use replace:Also be aware of the inplace parameter for replace. You can do something like:This will replace all instances in the df without creating a copy.Similarly, if you run into other types of unknown values such as empty string or None value:Reference: Pandas Latest - ReplaceThis solve your problem. With the double [], you are working on a copy of the DataFrame. You have to specify exact location in one call to be able to modify it.You can try these snippets.

My settings file is:I got the base_template from  the template admin/base_site.html from within the default Django admin template directory in the source code of Django itself (django/contrib/admin/templates) into an admin subdirectory of myapp directory as the tutorial instructed. It doesn't seem to take affect for some reason. Any clue of what might be the problem? Do I have to do a sync db?I know this isn't in the Django tutorial, and shame on them, but it's better to set up relative paths for your path variables. You can set it up like so:This way you can move your Django project and your path roots will update automatically. This is useful when you're setting up your production server.Second, there's something suspect to your TEMPLATE_DIRS path. It should point to the root of your template directory. Also, it should also end in a trailing /.I'm just going to guess here that the .../admin/ directory is not your template root. If you still want to write absolute paths you should take out the reference to the admin template directory.With that being said, the template loaders by default should be set up to recursively traverse into your app directories to locate template files.You shouldn't need to copy over the admin templates unless if you specifically want to overwrite something.You will have to run a syncdb if you haven't run it yet. You'll also need to statically server your media files if you're hosting django through runserver.If using Django settings as installed, then why not just use its baked-in, predefined BASE_DIR and TEMPLATES? In the pip installed Django(v1.8), I get: Smart solution in Django 2.0.3 for keeping templates in project directory (/root/templates/app_name):settings.pyin views.py just add such template path:For Django 1.6.6:Also static and media for debug and production mode:Into urls.py you must add:In Django 1.8 you can set template paths, backend and other parameters for templates in one dictionary (settings.py):Official docs.I also had issues with this part of the tutorial (used tutorial for version 1.7).My mistake was that I only edited the 'Django administration' string, and did not pay enough attention to the manual.This is the line from django/contrib/admin/templates/admin/base_site.html:But after some time and frustration it became clear that there was the 'site_header or default:_' statement, which should be removed. So after removing the statement (like the example in the manual everything worked like expected).Example manual:Alright 😁 Let's say you have a brand new project, if so you would go to settings.py file and search for TEMPLATES once you found it you just paste this line os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'template') in 'DIRS' At the end, you should get somethings like this : If you want to know where your BASE_DIR directory is located type these 3 simple commands: Once you're in the shell :PS: If you named your template folder with another name, you would change it here too.

Is there a standard way in Python to titlecase a string (i.e. words start with uppercase characters, all remaining cased characters have lowercase) but leaving articles like and, in, and of lowercased?There are a few problems with this. If you use split and join, some white space characters will be ignored. The built-in capitalize and title methods do not ignore white space. If a sentence starts with an article, you do not want the first word of a title in lowercase.Keeping these in mind:Use the titlecase.py module! Works only for English.GitHub: https://github.com/ppannuto/python-titlecaseThere are these methods:There's no lowercase article option. You'd have to code that yourself, probably by using a list of articles you want to lower.Stuart Colville has made a Python port of a Perl script written by John Gruber to convert strings into title case but avoids capitalizing small words based on rules from the New York Times Manual of style, as well as catering for several special cases.Some of the cleverness of these scripts:You can download it here.This should do. I get it differently.Ok as said in reply above, you have to make a custom capitalize:mytext = u'i am a foobar bazbar'This outputsPython 2.7's title method has a flaw in it.will return Carpenter'S Assistant when value is Carpenter's AssistantThe best solution is probably the one from @BioGeek using titlecase from Stuart Colville.  Which is the same solution proposed by @Etienne.The title starts with capitalized word and that does not match the article.One-liner using list comprehension and the ternary operatorBreakdown:for word in "Wow, a python one liner for titles".split(" ") Splits the string into an list and initiates a for loop (in the list comprehenstion)word.title() if word not in "the a on in of an" else word uses native method title() to title case the string if it's not an article" ".join joins the list elements with a seperator of (space)

The method just need to return a True if all the values are indeed zero.Check out numpy.count_nonzero.The other answers posted here will work, but the clearest and most efficient function to use is numpy.any():orI'd use np.all here, if you have an array a:As another answer says, you can take advantage of truthy/falsy evaluations if you know that 0 is the only falsy element possibly in your array. All elements in an array are falsy iff there are not any truthy elements in it.*However, the answer claimed that any was faster than other options due partly to short-circuiting. As of 2018, Numpy's all and any do not short-circuit. If you do this kind of thing often, it's very easy to make your own short-circuiting versions using numba:These tend to be faster than Numpy's versions even when not short-circuiting. count_nonzero is the slowest.

I have also given the database settings that i have used.Databse Settings::Thanks a lot for the help !!It looks like you don't have the python mysql package installed, try:or if not using a virtual environment (on *nix hosts):you have to install python-mysqldb - Python interface to MySQLTry 

sudo apt-get install python-mysqldbIf you get errors trying to install mysqlclient with pip, you may lack the mysql dev library. Install it by running:and try again to install mysqlclient:When I set up Django development environment for PyCharm in Mac OS X Mountain Lion with python, mysql, sequel pro application I got error same as owner of this thread.

However, my answer for them who is running python-mysqldb under Mac OS Mountain Lion x86_x64 (MySql and Python also should be same architecture) and already tried everything like pip and etc. In order fix this problem do following steps:Currently everything works fine. So I hope it will be helpful for somebody who uses Mac. :)My answer is similar to @Ron-E, but I got a few more errors/corrections so I'm putting my steps below for Mac OSX on Mavericks and Python 2.7.6.You are missing the python mysqldb library. Use this command (for Debian/Ubuntu) to install it:

sudo apt-get install python-mysqldbDownload and install Mysql-python from here for windows environment.  http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#mysql-python. It is because it did not find sql connector. try:On Ubuntu it is advised to use the distributions repository.This happened with me as well and I believe this has become a common error not only for Django developers but also for Flask as well, so the way I solved this issue was using brew.This way every single issue was solved and both frameworks work absolutely fine.P.S.: For those who use macports (such as myself), this can be an issue as brew works in a different level, my advice is to use brew instead of macportsI hope I could be helpful.For Ubuntu 16.04 and 18.04 or python 3 versionsIf you are using pyhton version 3.4 or above. you have to install in terminal. then install pip install mysqlclient on your virtual env or where you installed pip.I've solved this issue in this environment:./settings.pyIf you use 'ENGINE': 'mysql.connector.django' , install driver executing:  Note that $ pip install mysql-pythondidn't work for me.   Note that if you use  'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.mysql' , you should install driver executing:

$ pip install mysqlclientFinally execute:

$ python manage.py migrateIf it's all right, python creates all these tables id database: With the same error message as Will, it worked for me to install mysql first as the missing file will be added during the installation.

So afterran without errors.I was having the same problem.The following solved my issueRun pip install pymysql in your shellThen, edit the init.py file in your project origin directory(the same as settings.py)

and thenadd:import pymysqlpymysql.install_as_MySQLdb()this should solve the problem.Just to add to other answers, if you're using Django, it is advisable that you install mysql-python BEFORE installing Django.I wasted a lot of time on this. Turns out that the default database library is not supported for Python 3. You have to use a different one.if the error looks like this then try :Faced similar issue. I tried installing mysql-python using pip, but it failed due to gcc dependency errors.The solution that worked for mePlease note that I already had anaconda installed, which didn't had gcc dependency.try:I recommend to use it in a virtual environment.Maybe you can try the following mode of operation:

sudo python manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8000Seems like you don't have permission to the Python folder. Try sudo chown -R $USER /Library/Python/2.7

I like doxygen to create documentation of C or PHP code. I have an upcoming Python project and I think I remember that Python doesn't have /* .. */ comments, and also has its own self-documentation facility which seems to be the pythonic way to document.Since I'm familiar with doxygen, how can I use it to produce my Python documentation? Is there anything in particular that I need to be aware of?This is documented on the doxygen website, but to summarize here:You can use doxygen to document your Python code. You can either use the Python documentation string syntax:In which case the comments will be extracted by doxygen, but you won't be able to use any of the special doxygen commands.Or you can (similar to C-style languages under doxygen) double up the comment marker (#) on the first line before the member:In that case, you can use the special doxygen commands. There's no particular Python output mode, but you can apparently improve the results by setting OPTMIZE_OUTPUT_JAVA to YES.Honestly, I'm a little surprised at the difference - it seems like once doxygen can detect the comments in ## blocks or """ blocks, most of the work would be done and you'd be able to use the special commands in either case. Maybe they expect people using """ to adhere to more Pythonic documentation practices and that would interfere with the special doxygen commands?The doxypy input filter allows you to use pretty much all of Doxygen's formatting tags in a standard Python docstring format.  I use it to document a large mixed C++ and Python game application framework, and it's working well.In the end, you only have two options:You generate your content using Doxygen, or you generate your content using Sphinx*.There are other options to note:Sphinx is mainly a tool for formatting docs written independently from the source code, as I understand it.For generating API docs from Python docstrings, the leading tools are pdoc and pydoctor. Here's pydoctor's generated API docs for Twisted and Bazaar.Of course, if you just want to have a look at the docstrings while you're working on stuff, there's the "pydoc" command line tool and as well as the help() function available in the interactive interpreter.An other very good documentation tool is sphinx. It will be used for the upcoming python 2.6 documentation and is used by django and a lot of other python projects.From the sphinx website:

I came across some code with a line similar toPlaying around with variations, I am still stuck on what this syntax does.Examples:This only makes sense with NumPy arrays. The behavior with lists is useless, and specific to Python 2 (not Python 3). You may want to double-check if the original object was indeed a NumPy array (see further below) and not a list.But in your code here, x is a simple list.Sinceis False

i.e 0, thereforex[x<2] is x[0]x[0] gets changed.Conversely, x[x>2] is x[True] or x[1]So, x[1] gets changed.Why does this happen?The rules for comparison are:So, we have the following ordernumeric < list < string < tupleSee the accepted answer for How does Python compare string and int?.If x is a NumPy array, then the syntax makes more sense because of boolean array indexing. In that case, x < 2 isn't a boolean at all; it's an array of booleans representing whether each element of x was less than 2. x[x < 2] = 0 then selects the elements of x that were less than 2 and sets those cells to 0. See Indexing.The bool is simply converted to an integer. The index is either 0 or 1.The original code in your question works only in Python 2. If x is a list in Python 2, the comparison x < y is False if y is an integer. This is because it does not make sense to compare a list with an integer. However in Python 2, if the operands are not comparable, the comparison is based in CPython on the alphabetical ordering of the names of the types; additionally all numbers come first in mixed-type comparisons. This is not even spelled out in the documentation of CPython 2, and different Python 2 implementations could give different results. That is [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] < 2 evaluates to False because 2 is a number and thus "smaller" than a list in CPython. This mixed comparison was eventually deemed to be too obscure a feature, and was removed in Python 3.0.Now, the result of < is a bool; and bool is a subclass of int:So basically you're taking the element 0 or 1 depending on whether the comparison is true or false.If you try the code above in Python 3, you will get TypeError: unorderable types: list() < int() due to a change in Python 3.0:There are many datatypes that overload the comparison operators to do something different (dataframes from pandas, numpy's arrays). If the code that you were using did something else, it was because x was not a list, but an instance of some other class with operator < overridden to return a value that is not a bool; and this value was then handled specially by x[] (aka __getitem__/__setitem__)This has one more use: code golf. Code golf is the art of writing programs that solve some problem in as few source code bytes as possible. is roughly equivalent toexcept that both a and b are evaluated in the first version, but not in the second version.c<d evaluates to True or False.

(a, b) is a tuple.

Indexing on a tuple works like indexing on a list: (3,5)[1] == 5.

True is equal to 1 and False is equal to 0.  or for False:There's a good list on the stack exchange network of many nasty things you can do to python in order to save a few bytes. https://codegolf.stackexchange.com/questions/54/tips-for-golfing-in-pythonAlthough in normal code this should never be used, and in your case it would mean that x acts both as something that can be compared to an integer and as a container that supports slicing, which is a very unusual combination. It's probably Numpy code, as others have pointed out.In general it could mean anything. It was already explained what it means if x is a list or numpy.ndarray but in general it only depends on how the comparison operators (<, >, ...) and also how the get/set-item ([...]-syntax) are implemented.Because:This can be customized to do anything you want. Just as an example (mimics a bit numpys-boolean indexing):So now let's see what happens if you use it:Notice this is just one possibility. You are free to implement almost everything you want.

Does pandas iterrows have performance issues?

I have noticed very poor performance when using iterrows from pandas.Is this something that is experienced by others? Is it specific to iterrows and should this function be avoided for data of a certain size (I'm working with 2-3 million rows)?This discussion on GitHub led me to believe it is caused when mixing dtypes in the dataframe, however the simple example below shows it is there even when using one dtype (float64). This takes 36 seconds on my machine:Why are vectorized operations like apply so much quicker? I imagine there must be some row by row iteration going on there too. I cannot figure out how to not use iterrows in my case (this I'll save for a future question). Therefore I would appreciate hearing if you have consistently been able to avoid this iteration.

I'm making calculations based on data in separate dataframes. Thank you!---Edit: simplified version of what I want to run has been added below---Generally, iterrows should only be used in very very specific cases. This is the general order of precedence for performance of various operations:Using a custom cython routine is usually too complicated, so let's skip that for now.1) Vectorization is ALWAYS ALWAYS the first and best choice. However,  there are a small set of cases which cannot be vectorized in obvious ways (mostly involving a recurrence). Further, on a smallish frame, it may be faster to do other methods.3) Apply involves can usually be done by an iterator in Cython space (this is done internally in pandas) (this is a) case.This is dependent on what is going on inside the apply expression. e.g. df.apply(lambda x: np.sum(x)) will be executed pretty swiftly (of course df.sum(1) is even better). However something like: df.apply(lambda x: x['b'] + 1) will be executed in python space, and consequently is slower.4) itertuples does not box the data into a Series, just returns it as a tuple5) iterrows DOES box the data into a Series. Unless you really need this, use another method.6) updating an empty frame a-single-row-at-a-time. I have seen this method used WAY too much. It is by far the slowest. It is probably common place (and reasonably fast for some python structures), but a DataFrame does a fair number of checks on indexing, so this will always be very slow to update a row at a time. Much better to create new structures and concat.Vector operations in Numpy and pandas are much faster than scalar operations in vanilla Python for several reasons:Moral of the story: use the vector operations in Numpy and pandas. They are faster than scalar operations in Python for the simple reason that these operations are exactly what a C programmer would have written by hand anyway. (Except that the array notion is much easier to read than explicit loops with embedded SIMD instructions.)Here's the way to do your problem. This is all vectorized.Another option is to use to_records(), which is faster than both itertuples and iterrows.But for your case, there is much room for other types of improvements.Here's my final optimized versionBenchmark test:Full code:The final version is almost 10x faster than the original code. The strategy is:Yes, Pandas itertuples() is faster than iterrows().

you can refer the documentation: https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.iterrows.html"To preserve dtypes while iterating over the rows, it is better to use itertuples() which returns namedtuples of the values and which is generally faster than iterrows."

What could be causing this error when I try to insert a foreign character into the database?And how do I resolve it?Thanks!Character U+201C Left Double Quotation Mark is not present in the Latin-1 (ISO-8859-1) encoding.It is present in code page 1252 (Western European). This is a Windows-specific encoding that is based on ISO-8859-1 but which puts extra characters into the range 0x80-0x9F. Code page 1252 is often confused with ISO-8859-1, and it's an annoying but now-standard web browser behaviour that if you serve your pages as ISO-8859-1, the browser will treat them as cp1252 instead. However, they really are two distinct encodings:If you are using your database only as a byte store, you can use cp1252 to encode「 and other characters present in the Windows Western code page. But still other Unicode characters which are not present in cp1252 will cause errors.You can use encode(..., 'ignore') to suppress the errors by getting rid of the characters, but really in this century you should be using UTF-8 in both your database and your pages. This encoding allows any character to be used. You should also ideally tell MySQL you are using UTF-8 strings (by setting the database connection and the collation on string columns), so it can get case-insensitive comparison and sorting right.I ran into this same issue when using the Python MySQLdb module.  Since MySQL will let you store just about any binary data you want in a text field regardless of character set, I found my solution here:Using UTF8 with Python MySQLdbEdit: Quote from the above URL to satisfy the request in the first comment...The best solution is detail see :I hope your database is at least UTF-8. Then you will need to run yourstring.encode('utf-8') before you try putting it into the database.You are trying to store a Unicode codepoint \u201c using an encoding ISO-8859-1 / Latin-1 that can't describe that codepoint. Either you might need to alter the database to use utf-8, and store the string data using an appropriate encoding, or you might want to sanitise your inputs prior to storing the content; i.e. using something like Sam Ruby's excellent i18n guide. That talks about the issues that windows-1252 can cause, and suggests how to process it, plus links to sample code!SQLAlchemy users can simply specify their field as convert_unicode=True.Example:

sqlalchemy.String(1000, convert_unicode=True)SQLAlchemy will simply accept unicode objects and return them back, handling the encoding itself.DocsLatin-1 (aka ISO 8859-1) is a single octet character encoding scheme, and you can't fit \u201c (「) into a byte.Did you mean to use UTF-8 encoding?Use the below snippet to convert the text from Latin to Englishoutput: Python:  You will need to add 

# - * - coding: UTF-8 - * - (remove the spaces around * )

 to the first line of the python file. and then add the following to the text to encode: .encode('ascii', 'xmlcharrefreplace'). This will replace all the unicode characters with it's ASCII equivalent.

Just because you can write it out in a single line doesn't mean that you should. Your existing solution is close to what I would use other than I would user iteritems to skip the value lookup, and I hate nested ifs if I can avoid them:However if you realllly want something to let you iterate through a filtered dict then I would not do the two step process of building the filtered dict and then iterating through it, but instead use a generator, because what is more pythonic (and awesome) than a generator?First we create our generator, and good design dictates that we make it abstract enough to be reusable:And then we can use the generator to solve your problem nice and cleanly with simple, understandable code:    In short: generators are awesome.You can use the built-in filter function to filter dictionaries, lists, etc. based on specific conditions.The advantage is that you can use it for different data structures.Jonathon gave you an approach using dict comprehensions in his answer. Here is an approach that deals with your do something part.If you want to do something with the values of the dictionary, you don't need a dictionary comprehension at all:I'm using iteritems() since you tagged your question with python-2.7Now the result will be in a list with some_function applied to each key/value pair of the dictionary, that has foo in its key.If you just want to deal with the values and ignore the keys, just change the list comprehension:some_function can be any callable, so a lambda would work as well:The inner list is actually not required, as you can pass a generator expression to map as well:

I'd like to copy a numpy 2D array into a third dimension. For example, given the (2D) numpy array:convert it into a 3D matrix with N such copies in a new dimension.  Acting on arr with N=3, the output should be:Probably the cleanest way is to use np.repeat:Having said that, you can often avoid repeating your arrays altogether by using broadcasting. For example, let's say I wanted to add a (3,) vector:to a. I could copy the contents of a 3 times in the third dimension, then copy the contents of c twice in both the first and second dimensions, so that both of my arrays were (2, 2, 3), then compute their sum. However, it's much simpler and quicker to do this:Here, a[..., None] has shape (2, 2, 1) and c[None, None, :] has shape (1, 1, 3)*. When I compute the sum, the result gets 'broadcast' out along the dimensions of size 1, giving me a result of shape (2,  2,  3):Broadcasting is a very powerful technique because it avoids the additional overhead involved in creating repeated copies of your input arrays in memory.* Although I included them for clarity, the None indices into c aren't actually necessary - you could also do a[..., None] + c, i.e. broadcast a (2, 2, 1) array against a (3,) array. This is because if one of the arrays has fewer dimensions than the other then only the trailing dimensions of the two arrays need to be compatible. To give a more complicated example:Another way is to use numpy.dstack.  Supposing that you want to repeat the matrix a num_repeats times:The trick is to wrap the matrix a into a list of a single element, then using the * operator to duplicate the elements in this list num_repeats times.For example, if:This repeats the array of [1 2; 1 2] 5 times in the third dimension.  To verify (in IPython):At the end we can see that the shape of the matrix is 2 x 2, with 5 slices in the third dimension.Introduced in NumPy 1.10.0, we can leverage numpy.broadcast_to to simply generate a 3D view into the 2D input array. The benefit would be no extra memory overhead and virtually free runtime. This would be essential in cases where the arrays are big and we are okay to work with views. Also, this would work with generic n-dim cases.I would use the word stack in place of copy, as readers might confuse it with the copying of arrays that creates memory copies.Stack along first axisIf we want to stack input arr along the first axis, the solution with np.broadcast_to to create 3D view would be -Stack along third/last axisTo stack input arr along the third axis, the solution to create 3D view would be -If we actually need a memory copy, we can always append .copy() there. Hence, the solutions would be -Here's how the stacking works for the two cases, shown with their shape information for a sample case -Same solution(s) would work to extend a n-dim input to n+1-dim view output along the first and last axes. Let's explore some higher dim cases -3D input case :4D input case :and so on.Let's use a large sample 2D case and get the timings and verify output being a view.Let's prove that the proposed solution is a view indeed. We will use stacking along first axis (results would be very similar for stacking along the third axis) -Let's get the timings to show that it's virtually free -Being a view, increasing N from 3 to 3000 changed nothing on timings and both are negligible on timing units. Hence, efficient both on memory and performance!Edit @Mr.F, to preserve dimension order:Here's a broadcasting example that does exactly what was requested.Then b*a is the desired result and (b*a)[:,:,0] produces array([[1, 2],[1, 2]]), which is the original a, as does (b*a)[:,:,1], etc.

I'm trying to create functions inside of a loop:The problem is that all functions end up being the same. Instead of returning 0, 1, and 2, all three functions return 2:Why is this happening, and what should I do to get 3 different functions that output 0, 1, and 2 respectively?You're running into a problem with late binding -- each function looks up i as late as possible (thus, when called after the end of the loop, i will be set to 2).  Easily fixed by forcing early binding: change def f(): to def f(i=i): like this:Default values (the right-hand i in i=i is a default value for argument name i, which is the left-hand i in i=i) are looked up at def time, not at call time, so essentially they're a way to specifically looking for early binding.If you're worried about f getting an extra argument (and thus potentially being called erroneously), there's a more sophisticated way which involved using a closure as a "function factory":and in your loop use f = make_f(i) instead of the def statement.The issue here is that the value of i is not saved when the function f is created. Rather, f looks up the value of i when it is called.If you think about it, this behavior makes perfect sense. In fact, it's the only reasonable way functions can work. Imagine you have a function that accesses a global variable, like this:When you read this code, you would - of course - expect it to print "bar", not "foo", because the value of global_var has changed after the function was declared. The same thing is happening in your own code: By the time you call f, the value of i has changed and been set to 2.There are actually many ways to solve this problem. Here are a few options:Caveat: These solutions only work if you assign a new value to the variable. If you modify the object stored in the variable, you'll experience the same problem again:Notice how i still changed even though we turned it into a default argument! If your code mutates i, then you must bind a copy of i to your function, like so:

Another way to do this and to avoid error (for object columns type) is to apply drop_duplicates() You can also use SQL to do this, but it worked very slow in my case:There is no unique method for a df, if the number of unique values for each column were the same then the following would work: df.apply(pd.Series.unique) but if not then you will get an error.

I just installed pandas and statsmodels package on my python 2.7

When I tried  "import pandas as pd", this error message comes out.

Can anyone help? Thanks!!!(to expand a bit on my comment)Numpy developers follow in general a policy of keeping a backward compatible binary interface (ABI). However, the ABI is not forward compatible.What that means:A package, that uses numpy in a compiled extension, is compiled against a specific version of numpy. Future version of numpy will be compatible with the compiled extension of the package (for exception see below).

Distributers of those other packages do not need to recompile their package against a newer  versions of numpy and users do not need to update these other packages, when users update to a newer version of numpy.However, this does not go in the other direction. If a package is compiled against a specific numpy version, say 1.7, then there is no guarantee that the binaries of that package will work with older numpy versions, say 1.6, and very often or most of the time they will not.The binary distribution of packages like pandas and statsmodels, that are compiled against a recent version of numpy, will not work when an older version of numpy is installed.

Some packages, for example matplotlib, if I remember correctly, compile their extensions against the oldest numpy version that they support. In this case, users with the same old or any more recent version of numpy can use those binaries.The error message in the question is a typical result of binary incompatibilities.The solution is to get a binary compatible version, either by updating numpy to at least the version against which pandas or statsmodels were compiled, or to recompile pandas and statsmodels against the older version of numpy that is already installed.Breaking the ABI backward compatibility:Sometimes improvements or refactorings in numpy break ABI backward compatibility. This happened (unintentionally) with numpy 1.4.0.

As a consequence, users that updated numpy to 1.4.0, had binary incompatibilities with all other compiled packages, that were compiled against a previous version of numpy. This requires that all packages with binary extensions that use numpy have to be recompiled to work with the ABI incompatible version. For me (Mac OS X Maverics, Python 2.7)helped. After this you can install up-to-date packages pandas, scikit-learn, e.t.c. using pip:I found it to be a simple version being outdated or mismatch and was fixed with: Or might work with the one liner:I had a similar error with another library and realized that I had several versions of numpy installed on my system. The fix for me was to edit my PYTHONPATH and put the site-packages that contained the latest version of numpy in first position.As in here, for me only sudo pip install pandas==0.13.1 worked I also encounter this error when use pandas to access MYSQL.

This error message indicates a binary compatible issue and can be resolved by 

using latest version of pandas and numpy package. 

Here is my steps to resolve this issue, and it works well on my Ubuntu 12.04:In my case, I had installed pandas-0.10.0.win-amd64-py2.7 but was checking to see if a bug had been fixed in a more recent version of pandas.  So I did an easy_install -U to force the upgrade, but then got the above error due to some incompatibilities with numpy etc... when I did To fix, I just reinstalled the pandas-0.10.0.win-amd64-py2.7 binary and everything works. I didn't see this answer (suggests to use pip) which may have helped me (though not sure) Install particular version with easy_installAlso this highlights why one should use virtualenv (which I wasn't).For me (Mac OS X Mavericks) it worked to install the version for python2.6:then run:The problem I solved on Webfaction was old numpy library(1.5) which was in conflict with my fresh installation in .virtualenv. The problem was solved after I did pip install pandas out of the virtual environment.

The idea came from discussion on https://github.com/pydata/pandas/issues/3711, thanks, cpcloud!I just meet this 'ValueError' issue and have addressed it. Definitely there's something wrong with numpy package. But when I try to pip install --upgrade numpy it failed, so I uninstall and download the newest numpy.zip file.

Then manually uncompress and python setup.py install it.Luckly, it works!Like @user333700 said, required versions of libraries may not meet for each other. You get one library as another's dependency. Then without knowing it was already installed as dependency, you need that specific library and you install one version. With such ways dependencies may mess up.I lived such a case and looked for a solution. Found this:

https://stackoverflow.com/a/12975518/1694344I had two different versions for egg-info file and folder name of numpy:I removed them all and reinstalled numpy with pip.I had a similar issue, and simply re-installing using pip install ... as suggested in previous comments didn't work.What worked for me was re-installing with the added flag pip install --no-cache-dir ..., seems there was an incompatible numpy version somewhere in the cache.There are cases where you want to keep a specific NumPy version and the upgrade option mentioned here will not work. 

An example that occurred to me was the Python distribution preinstalled with ArcGIS. For ArcPy to work in ArcGIS 10.5.1, that distribution needs to be Python 2.7.12 with NumPy 1.9.3 and any other version of NumPy is probably going to cause issues with your ArcPy functionality. What you can do with this case is try to install a specific, older version of the problematic third-party library that is supposed to be compatible with the older NumPy version that ArcGIS has. For instance, scikit-learn 0.19.1 would NOT operate with NumPy 1.9.3 and would result in the same error you mentioned. However, scikit-learn 0.15 works fine. You can test different versions to find the one that works. Just mention the version number through pip:

For example, for the below files, my wrapper function should return True.To determine if a directory entry is a symlink use this:For instance, given:For python 3.4 and up, you can use the Path classYou have to be careful when using the is_symlink() method.  It will return True even the target of the link is non-existent as long as the the named object is a symlink.  For example (Linux/Unix):Then, in your current directory fire up pythonThe programmer has to decide what he/she realy wants.  Python 3 seems to have renamed a lots of classes. It might be worthwhile to read the manual page for the Path class: https://docs.python.org/3/library/pathlib.htmlWithout the intention to bloat this topic, but I was redirected to this page as I was looking for symlink's to find them and convert them to real files and found this script within the python tools library.

The lock would be to print the outputs correctly.The best solution for your problem is to utilize a Pool. Using Queues and having a separate "queue feeding" functionality is probably overkill.Here's a slightly rearranged version of your program, this time with only 2 processes coralled in a Pool. I believe it's the easiest way to go, with minimal changes to original code: Note that mp_worker() function now accepts a single argument (a tuple of the two previous arguments) because the map() function chunks up your input data into sublists, each sublist given as a single argument to your worker function.Output:Edit as per @Thales comment below:If you want "a lock for each pool limit" so that your processes run in tandem pairs, ala:A waiting B waiting | A done , B done | C waiting , D waiting | C done, D done | ...then change the handler function to launch pools (of 2 processes) for each pair of data:Now your output is:This might be not 100% related to the question, but on my search for an example of using multiprocessing with a queue this shows up first on google.This is a basic example class that you can instantiate and put items in a queue and can wait until queue is finished.

I am trying to plot a histogram using the matplotlib.hist() function but I am not sure how to do it.I have a list and a list of names(strings).How do I make the probability as my y-value of each bar and names as x-values? If you want a histogram, you don't need to attach any 'names' to x-values, as on x-axis you would have bins:However, if you have limited number of data points, and you want a bar plot, then you may attach labels to x-axis:Let me know if this solves your problem.EDIT 26 November 2018As per comment below, the following code will suffice as of Matplotlib 3.0.2:EDIT 23 May 2019As far as histogram is concerned, the normed param is deprecated:So, as from Matplolib 3.1 instead of:one has to write:If you haven't installed matplotlib yet just try the command.Though the question appears to be demanding plotting a histogram using matplotlib.hist() function, it can arguably be not done using the same as the latter part of the question demands to use the given probabilities as the y-values of bars and given names(strings) as the x-values.I'm assuming a sample list of names corresponding to given probabilities to draw the plot. A simple bar plot serves the purpose here for the given problem. The following code can be used:This is a very round-about way of doing it but if you want to make a histogram where you already know the bin values but dont have the source data, you can use the np.random.randint function to generate the correct number of values within the range of each bin for the hist function to graph, for example:as for labels you can align x ticks with bins to get something like this:

I'm having trouble wrapping my head around this.  Right now I have some models that looks kind of like this:A Review is has several "scores", the overall_score is the average of the scores.  When a review or a score is saved, I need to recalculate the overall_score average.  Right now I'm using a overridden save method.  Would there be any benefits to using Django's signal dispatcher?Save/delete signals are generally favourable in situations where you need to make changes which aren't completely specific to the model in question, or could be applied to models which have something in common, or could be configured for use across models.One common task in overridden save methods is automated generation of slugs from some text field in a model. That's an example of something which, if you needed to implement it for a number of models, would benefit from using a pre_save signal, where the signal handler could take the name of the slug field and the name of the field to generate the slug from. Once you have something like that in place, any enhanced functionality you put in place will also apply to all models - e.g. looking up the slug you're about to add for the type of model in question, to ensure uniqueness.Reusable applications often benefit from the use of signals - if the functionality they provide can be applied to any model, they generally (unless it's unavoidable) won't want users to have to directly modify their models in order to benefit from it.With django-mptt, for example, I used the pre_save signal to manage a set of fields which describe a tree structure for the model which is about to be created or updated and the pre_delete signal to remove tree structure details for the object being deleted and its entire sub-tree of objects before it and they are deleted. Due to the use of signals, users don't have to add or modify save or delete methods on their models to have this management done for them, they just have to let django-mptt know which models they want it to manage.You asked: Would there be any benefits to using Django's signal dispatcher?I found this in the django docs:From: Overriding predefined model methodsIf you'll use signals you'd be able to update Review score each time related score model gets saved. But if don't need such functionality i don't see any reason to put this into signal, that's pretty model-related stuff.It is a kind sort of denormalisation. Look at this pretty solution. In-place composition field definition.Small addition from Django docs about bulk delete (.delete() method on QuerySet objects):https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.11/topics/db/queries/#deleting-objectsAnd bulk update (.update() method on QuerySet objects):https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.1/ref/models/querysets/#updateSignals are useful when you have to execute some long term process and don't want to block your user waiting for save to complete.

I've read almost all the other questions about the topic, but my code still doesn't work.I think I'm missing something about python variable scope.Here is my code:And I get I know the problem is on the _total assignment, but I can't understand why.

Shouldn't recurse() have access to the parent function's variables?Can someone explain to me what I'm missing about python variable scope?When I run your code I get this error:This problem is caused by this line:The documentation about Scopes and Namespaces  says this:So since the line is effectively saying:it creates _total in the namespace of recurse().  Since _total is then new and unassigned you can't use it in the addition.Here's an illustration that gets to the essence of David's answer. With the statement b = 4 commented out, this code outputs 0 1, just what you'd expect.But if you uncomment that line, on the line print b, you get the errorIt seems mysterious that the presence of b = 4 might somehow make b disappear on the lines that precede it. But the text David quotes explains why: during static analysis, the interpreter determines that b is assigned to in inner, and that it is therefore a local variable of inner. The print line attempts to print the b in that inner scope before it has been assigned.In Python 3, you can use the nonlocal statement to access non-local, non-global scopes.Rather than declaring a special object or map or array,

one can also use a function attribute.

This makes the scoping of the variable really clear.Of course this attribute belongs to the function (defintion), and not to the function call.

So one must be mindful of threading and recursion.This is a variation of redman's solution, but using a proper namespace instead of an array to encapsulate the variable:I'm not sure if using a class object this way is considered an ugly hack or a proper coding technique in the python community, but it works fine in python 2.x and 3.x (tested with 2.7.3 and 3.2.3). I'm also unsure about the run-time efficiency of this solution.You probably have gotten the answer to your question. But i wanted to indicate a way i ussually get around this and that is by using lists. For instance, if i want to do this: I would instead do this:This way X is never a local variableWhile I used to use @redman's list-based approach, it's not optimal in terms of readability.Here is a modified @Hans' approach, except I use an attribute of the inner function, rather than the outer. This should be more compatible with recursion, and maybe even multithreading:This prints:If I s/inner.attribute/outer.attribute/g, we get:So, indeed, it seems better to make them the inner function's attributes.Also, it seems sensible in terms of readability: because then the variable conceptually relates to the inner function, and this notation reminds the reader that the variable is shared between the scopes of the inner and the outer functions. A slight downside for the readability is that the inner.attribute may only be set syntactically after the def inner(): ....More from a philosophical point of view, one answer might be "if you're having namespace problems, give it a namespace of its very own!"Providing it in its own class not only allows you to encapsulate the problem but also makes testing easier, eliminates those pesky globals, and reduces the need to shovel variables around between various top-level functions (doubtless there'll be more than just get_order_total).Preserving the OP's code to focus on the essential change,As a PS, one hack which is a variant on the list idea in another answer, but perhaps clearer,as you see, total is in the local scope of the main function, but it's not in the local scope of recurse (obviously) but neither it is in the global scope, 'cause it's defined only in the local scope of get_order_totalMy way around...

i.eThis has added my modules directory to sys.path. Now I want to remove the module is there any way to do this?Thanks in advanceUse the --uninstall or -u option to develop, i.e:This will remove it from easy-install.pth and delete the .egg-link.  The only thing it doesn't do is delete scripts (yet).Edit easy-install.pth in your site-packages directory and remove the line that points to your development version of that package.I have had a similar problem to this before. What I did was I loaded up the Python shell, imported the module and then printed its __file__ attribute. From there I would just remove the folder or file that was being associated.What you may want to look into is using virtualenv this system allows you to create a instance of python separate from your system. Any modules you install or use in this instance are self contained including the version of the module. I keep all my projects now inside of there own contained virtualenv, which allows me to install and use whatever modules I want without worrying about screwing up modules from other projects.

But I think that will be clear to most people.Broadcasting is really good for this:row_sums[:, numpy.newaxis] reshapes row_sums from being (3,) to being (3, 1). When you do a / b, a and b are broadcast against each other.You can learn more about broadcasting here or even better here.Scikit-learn has a normalize function that lets you apply various normalizations. The "make it sum to 1" is the L1 norm, and to take that do:Now your rows will sum to 1.I think this should work,In case you are trying to normalize each row such that its magnitude is one (i.e. a row's unit length is one or the sum of the square of each element in a row is one):Verifying:it appears that this also worksYou could also use matrix transposition:You could use built-in numpy function: 

np.linalg.norm(a, axis = 1, keepdims = True)Or using lambda function, likeeach vector of vec will have a unit norm.I think you can normalize the row elements sum to 1 by this:

    new_matrix = a / a.sum(axis=1, keepdims=1).

And the column normalization can be done with new_matrix = a / a.sum(axis=0, keepdims=1). Hope this can hep.where input_data is the name of your 2D array

I was following a tutorial which was available at Part 1 & Part 2. Unfortunately the author didn't have the time for the final section which involved using cosine similarity to actually find the distance between two documents. I followed the examples in the article with the help of the following link from stackoverflow, included is the code mentioned in the above link (just so as to make life easier)as a result of the above code I have the following matrixI am not sure how to use this output in order to calculate cosine similarity, I know how to implement cosine similarity with respect to two vectors of similar length but here I am not sure how to identify the two vectors.First off, if you want to extract count features and apply TF-IDF normalization and row-wise euclidean normalization you can do it in one operation with TfidfVectorizer:Now to find the cosine distances of one document (e.g. the first in the dataset) and all of the others you just need to compute the dot products of the first vector with all of the others as the tfidf vectors are already row-normalized.  As explained by Chris Clark in comments and here Cosine Similarity does not take into account the magnitude of the vectors. Row-normalised have a magnitude of 1 and so the Linear Kernel is sufficient to calculate the similarity values.The scipy sparse matrix API is a bit weird (not as flexible as dense N-dimensional numpy arrays). To get the first vector you need to slice the matrix row-wise to get a submatrix with a single row:scikit-learn already provides pairwise metrics (a.k.a. kernels in machine learning parlance) that work for both dense and sparse representations of vector collections. In this case we need a dot product that is also known as the linear kernel:Hence to find the top 5 related documents, we can use argsort and some negative array slicing (most related documents have highest cosine similarity values, hence at the end of the sorted indices array):The first result is a sanity check: we find the query document as the most similar document with a cosine similarity score of 1 which has the following text:The second most similar document is a reply that quotes the original message hence has many common words:WIth the Help of @excray's comment, I manage to figure it out the answer, What we need to do is actually write a simple for loop to iterate over the two arrays that represent the train data and test data. First implement a simple lambda function to hold formula for the cosine calculation:And then just write a simple for loop to iterate over the to vector, logic is for every "For each vector in trainVectorizerArray, you have to find the cosine similarity with the vector in testVectorizerArray."Here is the output:I know its an old post. but I tried the http://scikit-learn.sourceforge.net/stable/ package. here is my code to find the cosine similarity. The question was how will you calculate the cosine similarity with this package and here is my code for thatHere suppose the query is the first element of train_set and doc1,doc2 and doc3 are the documents which I want to rank with the help of cosine similarity. then I can use this code. Also the tutorials provided in the question was very useful. Here are all the parts for it 

part-I,part-II,part-IIIthe output will be as follows :here 1 represents that query is matched with itself and the other three are the scores for matching the query with the respective documents.Let me give you another tutorial written by me. It answers your question, but also makes an explanation why we are doing some of the things. I also tried to make it concise. So you have a list_of_documents which is just an array of strings and another document which is just a string. You need to find such document from the list_of_documents that is the most similar to document.Let's combine them together: documents = list_of_documents + [document]Let's start with dependencies. It will become clear why we use each of them.One of the approaches that can be uses is a bag-of-words approach, where we treat each word in the document independent of others and just throw all of them together in the big bag. From one point of view, it looses a lot of information (like how the words are connected), but from another point of view it makes the model simple.In English and in any other human language there are a lot of "useless" words like 'a', 'the', 'in' which are so common that they do not possess a lot of meaning. They are called stop words and it is a good idea to remove them. Another thing that one can notice is that words like 'analyze', 'analyzer', 'analysis' are really similar. They have a common root and all can be converted to just one word. This process is called stemming and there exist different stemmers which differ in speed, aggressiveness and so on. So we transform each of the documents to list of stems of words without stop words. Also we discard all the punctuation.So how will this bag of words help us? Imagine we have 3 bags: [a, b, c], [a, c, a] and [b, c, d]. We can convert them to vectors in the basis [a, b, c, d]. So we end up with vectors: [1, 1, 1, 0], [2, 0, 1, 0] and [0, 1, 1, 1]. The similar thing is with our documents (only the vectors will be way to longer). Now we see that we removed a lot of words and stemmed other also to decrease the dimensions of the vectors. Here there is just interesting observation. Longer documents will have way more positive elements than shorter, that's why it is nice to normalize the vector. This is called term frequency TF, people also used additional information about how often the word is used in other documents - inverse document frequency IDF. Together we have a metric TF-IDF which have a couple of flavors. This can be achieved with one line in sklearn :-)  Actually vectorizer allows to do a lot of things like removing stop words and lowercasing. I have done them in a separate step only because sklearn does not have non-english stopwords, but nltk has.So we have all the vectors calculated. The last step is to find which one is the most similar to the last one. There are various ways to achieve that, one of them is Euclidean distance which is not so great for the reason discussed here. Another approach is cosine similarity. We iterate all the documents and calculating cosine similarity between the document and the last one:Now minimum will have information about the best document and its score.This should help you.  and output will be:Here is a function that compares your test data against the training data, with the Tf-Idf transformer fitted with the training data. Advantage is that you can quickly pivot or group by to find the n closest elements, and that the calculations are down matrix-wise.

I am using python Requests. I need to debug some OAuth activity, and for that I would like it to log all requests being performed. I could get this information with ngrep, but unfortunately it is not possible to grep https connections (which are needed for OAuth)How can I activate logging of all URLs (+ parameters) that Requests is accessing?The underlying urllib3 library logs all new connections and URLs with the logging module, but not POST bodies. For GET requests this should be enough:which gives you the most verbose logging option; see the logging HOWTO for more details on how to configure logging levels and destinations.Short demo:Depending on the exact version of urllib3, the following messages are logged:This doesn't include headers or bodies. urllib3 uses the http.client.HTTPConnection class to do the grunt-work, but that class doesn't support logging, it can normally only be configured to print to stdout. However, you can rig it to send all debug information to logging instead by introducing an alternative print name into that module:Calling httpclient_logging_patch() causes http.client connections to output all debug information to a standard logger, and so are picked up by logging.basicConfig():You need to enable debugging at httplib level (requests → urllib3 → httplib).Here's some functions to both toggle (..._on() and ..._off()) or temporarily have it on:Demo use:You will see the REQUEST, including HEADERS and DATA, and RESPONSE with HEADERS but without DATA. The only thing missing will be the response.body which is not logged.SourceFor those using python 3+When trying to get the Python logging system (import logging) to emit low level debug log messages, it suprised me to discover that given:that only urllib3 actually uses the Python logging system:Sure, you can extract debug messages from HTTPConnection by setting:but these outputs are merely emitted via the print statement. To prove this, simply grep the Python 3.7 client.py source code and view the print statements yourself (thanks @Yohann):Presumably redirecting stdout in some way might work to shoe-horn stdout into the logging system and potentionally capture to e.g. a log file. To capture urllib3 debug information through the Python 3 logging system,  contrary to much advice on the internet, and as @MikeSmith points out, you won’t have much luck intercepting:instead you need to:Here is some code which logs urllib3 workings to a log file using the Python logging system:the result:If you set HTTPConnection.debuglevel = 1 you'll get the print statement output of additional juicy low level info:Remember this output uses print and not the Python logging system, and thus cannot be captured using a traditional logging stream or file handler (though it may be possible to capture output to a file by redirecting stdout).To maximise all possible logging, you must settle for console/stdout output with this:giving the full range of output:I'm using python 3.4, requests 2.19.1:'urllib3' is the logger to get now (no longer 'requests.packages.urllib3').  Basic logging will still happen without setting http.client.HTTPConnection.debuglevel

I really don't think it's the script.No, it's not the script, it's the fact that your script is not executed by Python at all. If your script is stored in a file named script.py, you have to execute it as python script.py, otherwise the default shell will execute it and it will bail out at the from keyword. (Incidentally, from is the name of a command line utility which prints names of those who have sent mail to the given username, so that's why it tries to access the mailboxes).Another possibility is to add the following line to the top of the script:This will instruct your shell to execute the script via python instead of trying to interpret it on its own.I ran into a similar error"from: can't read /var/mail/django.test.utils"when trying to run a commandin the tutorial at https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.8/intro/tutorial05/after reading the answer by Tamás

David B-HWhat you're trying to do is to hibernate your process. This was discussed already. The conclusion is that there are several hard-to-solve problems exist while trying to do so. For example with restoring open file descriptors.It is better to think about serialization/deserialization subsystem for your program. It is not trivial in many cases, but is far better solution in long-time perspective.Although if I've exaggerated the problem. You can try to pickle your global variables dict. Use globals() to access the dictionary. Since it is varname-indexed you haven't to bother about the order.If you want the accepted answer abstracted to function you can use:to get/load the workspace:it worked when I ran it. I will admit I don't understand dir() and globals() 100% so I am not sure if there might be some weird caveat, but so far it seems to work. Comments are welcome :)after some more research if you call save_workspace as I suggested with globals and save_workspace is within a function it won't work as expected if you want to save the veriables in a local scope. For that use locals(). This happens because globals takes the globals from the module where the function is defined, not from where it is called would be my guess.You can save it as a text file or a CVS file. People use Spyder for example to save variables but it has a known issue: for specific data types it fails to import down in the road.

Using your favourite option above, how about a logging function such as this:This would also make it trivial to add additional logic to split the logged string across multiple lines if the line is longer than your desired length.Cleanest way I have come across is inspired by the sql style guide.Essentially, the keywords that begin a clause should be right-aligned and the field names etc, should be left aligned. This looks very neat and is easier to debug as well.if the value of condition should be a string, you can do like this:you could put the field names into an array "fields", and then:I would suggest sticking to option 2 (I'm always using it for queries any more complex than SELECT * FROM table) and if you want to print it in a nice way you may always use a separate module.For short queries that can fit on one or two lines, I use the string literal solution in the top-voted solution above. For longer queries, I break them out to .sql files. I then use a wrapper function to load the file and execute the script, something like:Of course this often lives inside a class so I don't usually have to pass cursor explicitly. I also generally use codecs.open(), but this gets the general idea across. Then SQL scripts are completely self-contained in their own files with their own syntax highlighting.In Addition to @user590028 : Using format was helpful for what I was working on like so:And:To avoid formatting entirely, I think a great solution is to use procedures.Calling a procedure gives you the result of whatever query you want to put in this procedure. You can actually process multiple queries within a procedure. The call will just return the last query that was called.[edit in responese to comment]

However get_available_name is not the right method to override.get_available_name is called when Django sees a file with same name and tries to get a new available file name. It's not the method that causes the rename. the method caused that is _save. Comments in _save is pretty good and you can easily find it opens file for writing with flag os.O_EXCL which will throw an OSError if same file name already exists. Django catches this Error then calls get_available_name to get a new name.So I think the correct way is to override _save and call os.open() without flag os.O_EXCL. The modification is quite simple however the method is a little be long so I don't paste it here. Tell me if you need more help :)I had exactly the same problem! then I realize that my Models were causing that. example I hade my models like this:Then, I wanted to have more the one tile referencing the same file in the disk! The way that I found to solve that was change my Model structure to this:Which after I realize that make more sense, because if I want the same file being saved more then one in my DB I have to create another table for it!

Why?Official docs: Matplotlib, pyplot and pylab: how are they related?Both of those imports boil down do doing exactly the same thing and will run the exact same code, it is just different ways of importing the modules. Also note that matplotlib has two interface layers, a state-machine layer managed by pyplot and the OO interface pyplot is built on top of, see How can I attach a pyplot function to a figure instance?pylab is a clean way to bulk import a whole slew of helpful functions (the pyplot state machine function, most of numpy) into a single name space.  The main reason this exists (to my understanding) is to work with ipython to make a very nice interactive shell which more-or-less replicates MATLAB (to make the transition easier and because it is good for playing around). See pylab.py and matplotlib/pylab.pyAt some level, this is purely a matter of taste and depends a bit on what you are doing. If you are not embedding in a gui (either using a non-interactive backend for bulk scripts or using one of the provided interactive backends) the typical thing to do iswhich doesn't pollute the name space. I prefer this so I can keep track of where stuff came from.If you use this is equivalent to runningIt is now recommended that for new versions of ipython you usewhich will set up all the proper background details to make the interactive backends to work nicely, but will not bulk import anything.  You will need to explicitly import the modules want.is a good start.If you are embedding matplotlib in a gui you don't want to import pyplot as that will start extra gui main loops, and exactly what you should import depends on exactly what you are doing.The documentation at https://matplotlib.org/faq/usage_faq.html#matplotlib-pyplot-and-pylab-how-are-they-related, which also describes the difference between pyglot and pylab, states: "Although many examples use pylab, it is no longer recommended.".

Are there pandas methods that are meant for operations like this?In the code below, I first reset the index to make the row iteration easier.  I create a list of lists where each element of the outer list is a row of the target DataFrame and each element of the inner list is one of the columns.  This nested list will ultimately be concatenated to create the desired DataFrame.I use a lambda function together with list iteration to create a row for each element of the nearest_neighbors paired with the relevant name and opponent.  Finally, I create a new DataFrame from this list (using the original column names and setting the index back to name and opponent).EDIT JUNE 2017An alternative method is as follows:Use apply(pd.Series) and stack, then reset_index and to_frameDetailsExploding a list-like column has been simplified significantly in pandas 0.25 with the addition of the

explode() method:Out:I think this a really good question, in Hive you would use EXPLODE, I think there is a case to be made that Pandas should include this functionality by default. I would probably explode the list column with a nested generator comprehension like this:The fastest method I found so far is extending the DataFrame with .iloc and assigning back the flattened target column.Given the usual input (replicated a bit):Given the following suggested alternatives:I find that extend_iloc() is the fastest:Nicer alternative solution with apply(pd.Series):Similar to Hive's EXPLODE functionality: So all of these answers are good but I wanted something ^really simple^ so here's my contribution:That's it.. just use this when you want a new series where the lists are 'exploded'. Here's an example where we do value_counts() on taco choices :)Here is a potential optimization for larger dataframes. This runs faster when there are several equal values in the "exploding" field. (The larger the dataframe is compared to the unique value count in the field, the better this code will perform.)Extending Oleg's .iloc answer to automatically flatten all list-columns:This assumes that each list-column has equal list length.Instead of using apply(pd.Series) you can flatten the column.

[What is the difference between NaN and None?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/17534106/what-is-the-difference-between-nan-and-none)

I am reading two columns of a csv file using pandas readcsv() and then assigning the values to a dictionary. The columns contain strings of numbers and letters. Occasionally there are cases where a cell is empty. In my opinion, the value read to that dictionary entry should be None but instead nan is assigned. Surely None is more descriptive of an empty cell as it has a null value, whereas nan just says that the value read is not a number.Is my understanding correct, what IS the difference between None and nan? Why is nan assigned instead of None?Also, my dictionary check for any empty cells has been using numpy.isnan():But this gives me an error saying that I cannot use this check for v. I guess it is because an integer or float variable, not a string is meant to be used. If this is true, how can I check v for an "empty cell"/nan case?

I guess it is because an integer or float variable, not a string is meant to be used. If this is true, how can I check v for an "empty cell"/nan case?NaN is used as a placeholder for missing data consistently in pandas, consistency is good. I usually read/translate NaN as "missing". Also see the 'working with missing data' section in the docs.Wes writes in the docs 'choice of NA-representation':Note: the "gotcha" that integer Series containing missing data are upcast to floats.In my opinion the main reason to use NaN (over None) is that it can be stored with numpy's float64 dtype, rather than the less efficient object dtype, see NA type promotions.Jeff comments (below) on this:Saying that, many operations may still work just as well with None vs NaN (but perhaps are not supported i.e. they may sometimes give surprising results):To answer the second question:

You should be using pd.isnull and pd.notnull to test for missing data (NaN).NaN can be used as a numerical value on mathematical operations, while None cannot (or at least shouldn't).NaN is a numeric value, as defined in IEEE 754 floating-point standard.

None is an internal Python tipe (NoneType) and would be more like "inexistent" or "empty" than "numerically invalid" in this context.The main "symptom" of that is that, if you perform, say, an average or a sum on an array containing NaN, even a single one, you get NaN as a result...In the other hand, you cannot perform mathematical operations using None as operand.So, depending on the case, you could use None as a way to tell your algorithm not to consider invalid or inexistent values on computations. That would mean the algorithm should test each value to see if it is None.Numpy has some functions to avoid NaN values to contaminate your results, such as nansum and nan_to_num for example.The function isnan() checks to see if something is "Not A Number" and will return whether or not a variable is a number, for example isnan(2) would return falseThe conditional myVar is not None returns whether or not the variable is definedYour numpy array uses isnan() because it is intended to be an array of numbers and it initializes all elements of the array to NaN these elements are considered "empty"Below are the differences:I found the below article very helpful:

The question, number 10501247, in stackoverflow gives answer how to create temporary file in Python.

I only need to have temporary file name in my case.

Calling tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile() returns file handle after actual file creation.

Is there way to get file name only?If you want a temp file name only you can call inner tempfile function _get_candidate_names():Calling next again, will return another name, etc. This does not give you the path to temp folder. To get default 'tmp' directory, use: I think the easiest, most secure way of doing this is something like:A temporary directory is created that only you can access, so there should be no security issues, but there will be no files created in it, so you can just pick any filename you want to create in that directory.It may be a little late, but is there anything wrong with this?tempfile.mktemp() do this.But note that it's deprecated. However it will not create the file and it is a public function in tempfile compared to using the _get_candidate_names().The reason it's deprecated is due to the time gap between calling this and actually trying to create the file. However in my case the chance of that is so slim and even if it would fail that would be acceptable. But it's up to you to evaluate for your usecase.As Joachim Isaksson said in the comments, if you just get a name you may have problems if some other program happens to use that name before your program does. The chances are slim, but not impossible.So the safe thing to do in this situation is to use the full GzipFile() constructor, which has the signature GzipFile( [filename[, mode[, compresslevel[, fileobj]]]]). So you can pass it the open fileobj, and a filename as well, if you like. See the gzip docs for details.Combining the previous answers, my solution is:Make some_id optional if not needed for you.

Obviously, this is because of the massive memory requirements.Is there is a way to create huge matrices natively in NumPy (say 1 million by 1 million) in some way (without having several terrabytes of RAM)?PyTables and NumPy are the way to go.PyTables will store the data on disk in HDF format, with optional compression. My datasets often get 10x compression, which is handy when dealing with tens or hundreds of millions of rows. It's also very fast; my 5 year old laptop can crunch through data doing SQL-like GROUP BY aggregation at 1,000,000 rows/second. Not bad for a Python-based solution!Accessing the data as a NumPy recarray again is as simple as:The HDF library takes care of reading in the relevant chunks of data and converting to NumPy.numpy.arrays are meant to live in memory.  If you want to work with matrices larger than your RAM, you have to work around that.  There are at least two approaches you can follow:You should be able to use numpy.memmap to memory map a file on disk.  With newer python and 64-bit machine, you should have the necessary address space, without loading everything into memory.  The OS should handle only keep part of the file in memory.To handle sparse matrices, you need the scipy package that sits on top of numpy -- see here for more details about the sparse-matrix options that scipy gives you.Stefano Borini's post got me to look into how far along this sort of thing already is.  This is it.  It appears to do basically what you want.  HDF5 will let you store very large datasets, and then access and use them in the same ways NumPy does.  Make sure you're using a 64-bit operating system and a 64-bit version of Python/NumPy. Note that on 32-bit architectures you can address typically 3GB of memory (with about 1GB lost to memory mapped I/O and such). With 64-bit and things arrays larger than the available RAM you can get away with virtual memory, though things will get slower if you have to swap. Also, memory maps (see numpy.memmap) are a way to work with huge files on disk without loading them into memory, but again, you need to have a 64-bit address space to work with for this to be of much use. PyTables will do most of this for you as well.It's a bit alpha, but http://blaze.pydata.org/ seems to be working on solving this. Sometimes one simple solution is using a custom type for your matrix items. Based on the range of numbers you need, you can use a manual dtype and specially smaller for your items. Because Numpy considers the largest type for object by default this might be a helpful idea in many cases. Here is an example:And with custom type:Are you asking how to handle a 2,500,000,000 element matrix without terabytes of RAM?  The way to handle 2 billion items without 8 billion bytes of RAM is by not keeping the matrix in memory.That means much more sophisticated algorithms to fetch it from the file system in pieces.Usually when we deal with large matrices we implement them as Sparse Matrices.I don't know if numpy supports sparse matrices but I found this instead.As far as I know about numpy, no, but I could be wrong. I can propose you this alternative solution: write the matrix on the disk and access it in chunks. I suggest you the HDF5 file format. If you need it transparently, you can reimplement the ndarray interface to paginate your disk-stored matrix into memory. Be careful if you modify the data to sync them back on the disk.

I tend to think finding a better access pattern to your sortable keys is better than writing a fancy comparator.I had a similar issue today - I had to sort dictionary items by descending numeric values and by ascending string values. To solve the issue of conflicting directions, I negated the integer values. Here's a variant of my solution - as applicable to OPVery simple - and works like a charmDemonstration:The parsing is a bit fragile, but at least it allows for variable number of spaces between the keys.Since you're already comfortable with lambda, here's a less verbose solution.

How can Python dict have multiple keys with same hash?

[How can Python dict have multiple keys with same hash?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9010222/how-can-python-dict-have-multiple-keys-with-same-hash)

I am trying to understand python hash function under the hood. I created a custom class where all instances return the same hash value. I just assumed that only one instance of the above class can be in a set at any time, but in fact a set can have multiple elements with same hash.I experimented a little more and found that if I override the __eq__ method such that all the instances of the class compare equal, then the set only allows one instance.So I am curious to know how can a dict have multiple elements with same hash.

I am trying to understand python hash function under the hood. I created a custom class where all instances return the same hash value. I just assumed that only one instance of the above class can be in a set at any time, but in fact a set can have multiple elements with same hash.I experimented a little more and found that if I override the __eq__ method such that all the instances of the class compare equal, then the set only allows one instance.So I am curious to know how can a dict have multiple elements with same hash. Thanks!Note: Edited the question to give example of dict (instead of set) because all the discussion in the answers is about dicts. But the same applies to sets; sets can also have multiple elements with same hash value.For a detailed description of how Python's hashing works see my answer to Why is early return slower than else?Basically it uses the hash to pick a slot in the table. If there is a value in the slot and the hash matches, it compares the items to see if they are equal.If the hash doesn't match or the items aren't equal, then it tries another slot. There's a formula to pick this (which I describe in the referenced answer), and it gradually pulls in unused parts of the hash value; but once it has used them all up, it will eventually work its way through all slots in the hash table. That guarantees eventually we either find a matching item or an empty slot. When the search finds an empty slot, it inserts the value or gives up (depending whether we are adding or getting a value).The important thing to note is that there are no lists or buckets: there is just a hash table with a particular number of slots, and each hash is used to generate a sequence of candidate slots.Here is everything about Python dicts that I was able to put together (probably more than anyone would like to know; but the answer is comprehensive). A shout out to Duncan for pointing out that Python dicts use slots and leading me down this rabbit hole.There you go! The Python implementation of dict checks for both hash equality of two keys and the normal equality (==) of the keys when inserting items. So in summary, if there are two keys, a and b and hash(a)==hash(b), but a!=b, then both can exist harmoniously in a Python dict. But if hash(a)==hash(b) and a==b, then they cannot both be in the same dict. Because we have to probe after every hash collision, one side effect of too many hash collisions is that the lookups and insertions will become very slow (as Duncan points out in the comments).I guess the short answer to my question is, "Because that's how it's implemented in the source code ;)"While this is good to know (for geek points?), I am not sure how it can be used in real life. Because unless you are trying to explicitly break something, why would two objects that are not equal, have same hash? Edit: the answer below is one of possible ways to deal with hash collisions, it is however not how Python does it. Python's wiki referenced below is also incorrect. The best source given by @Duncan below is the implementation itself: http://svn.python.org/projects/python/trunk/Objects/dictobject.c I apologize for the mix-up.It stores a list (or bucket) of elements at the hash then iterates through that list until it finds the actual key in that list. A picture says more than a thousand words:Here you see John Smith and Sandra Dee both hash to 152. Bucket 152 contains both of them. When looking up Sandra Dee it first finds the list in bucket 152, then loops through that list until Sandra Dee is found and returns 521-6955.The following is wrong it's only here for context: On Python's wiki you can find (pseudo?) code how Python performs the lookup.There's actually several possible solutions to this problem, check out the wikipedia article for a nice overview: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_table#Collision_resolutionHash tables, in general have to allow for hash collisions! You will get unlucky and two things will eventually hash to the same thing. Underneath, there is a set of objects in a list of items that has that same hash key. Usually, there is only one thing in that list, but in this case, it'll keep stacking them into the same one. The only way it knows they are different is through the equals operator.When this happens, your performance will degrade over time, which is why you want your hash function to be as "random as possible".In the thread I did not see what exactly python does with instances of a user-defined classes when we put it into a dictionary as a keys. Let's read some documentation: it declares that only hashable objects can be used as a keys. Hashable are all immutable built-in classes and all user-defined classes.So if you have a constantly __hash__ in your class, but not providing any __cmp__ or __eq__ method, then all your instances are unequal for the dictionary.

In the other hand, if you providing any __cmp__ or __eq__ method, but not providing __hash__, your instances are still unequal in terms of dictionary.Output

If you use one of those instead of the regular windows cmd shell, the conda command, python etc. should be available by default in this shell.Things have been changed after conda 4.6.Programs "Anaconda Prompt" and "Anaconda Powershell" expose the command conda for you automatically. Find them in your startup menu.If you don't wanna use the prompts above and try to make conda available in a normal cmd.exe and a Powershell. Read the following content.The purpose of the following content is to make command conda available both in cmd.exe and Powershell on Windows.If you have already checked "Add Anaconda to my PATH environment variable" during Anaconda installation, skip step 1.These steps make sure the conda command is exposed into your cmd.exe and Powershell.Caveat: Add the new \path\to\anaconda3\condabin but not \path\to\anaconda3\Scripts into your PATH. This is a big change introduced in conda 4.6.Activation script initialization fron conda 4.6 release logIn the old days, \path\to\anaconda3\Scripts is the one to be put into your PATH. It exposes command conda and the default Python from "base" environment at the same time.After conda 4.6, conda related commands are separated into condabin. This makes it possible to expose ONLY command conda without activating the Python from "base" environment.If you want to use Anaconda in regular cmd on windows you need to add several paths to your Path env variable.Those paths are (instead of Anaconda3 the folder may be Anaconda2 depending on the Anaconda version on your PC):I had also faced the same problem just an hour back.

The string.printable way will happily strip them out of the output. 

curses.ascii.isprint will return false for any unicode character.Iterating over strings is unfortunately rather slow in Python. Regular expressions are over an order of magnitude faster for this kind of thing. You just have to build the character class yourself. The unicodedata module is quite helpful for this, especially the unicodedata.category() function. See Unicode Character Database for descriptions of the categories.As far as I know, the most pythonic/efficient method would be:You could try setting up a filter using the unicodedata.category() function:See Table 4-9 on page 175 in the Unicode database character properties for the available categoriesIn Python 3,See this StackOverflow post on removing punctuation for how .translate() compares to regex & .replace()This function uses list comprehensions and str.join, so it runs in linear time instead of O(n^2):The following will work with Unicode input and is rather fast...My own testing suggests this approach is faster than functions that iterate over the string and return a result using str.join.The best I've come up with now is (thanks to the python-izers above) This is the only way I've found out that works with Unicode characters/stringsAny better options?The one below performs faster than the others above.

I have this:Is there anyway I can get the updated list as result, instead of updating the original list in place?l.insert(index, obj) doesn't actually return anything, it just updates the list.

As ATO said, you can do b = a[:index] + [obj] + a[index:].

However, another way is:You may also insert the element using the slice indexing in the list. For example:For inserting multiple elements together at a given index, all you need to do is to use a list of multiple elements that you want to insert. For example:Alternative using List Comprehension (but very slow in terms of performance):As an alternative, it can be achieved using list comprehension with enumerate too.

See @Gary Kerr's answer.I see 2 options.Use the built in function zipJust looking at the new features of 2.7. There is now a function in the itertools module which is similar to the above code.http://docs.python.org/library/itertools.html#itertools.compressAssuming you only have the list of items and a list of true/required indices, this should be the fastest:This means the property selection will only do as many rounds as there are true/required indices. If you have a lot of property lists that follow the rules of a single tags (true/false) list you can create an indices list using the same list comprehension principles:This iterates through each item in good_objects (while remembering its index with enumerate) and  returns only the indices where the item is true.For anyone not getting the list comprehension, here is an English prose version with the code highlighted in bold:list the index for every group of index, item that exists in an enumeration of good objects, if (where) the item is TrueMatlab and Scilab languages offer a simpler and more elegant syntax than Python for the question you're asking, so I think the best you can do is to mimic Matlab/Scilab by using the Numpy package in Python. By doing this the solution to your problem is very concise and elegant:Numpy tries to mimic Matlab/Scilab but it comes at a cost: you need to declare every list with the keyword "array", something which will overload your script (this problem doesn't exist with Matlab/Scilab). Note that this solution is restricted to arrays of number, which is the case in your example.

ThanksSetting stdout is a reasonable way to do it.  Another is to run it as another process:Here is a context manager version of your code.  It yields a list of two values; the first is stdout, the second is stderr.For future visitors: Python 3.4 contextlib provides for this directly (see Python contextlib help) via the redirect_stdout context manager:Or maybe use functionality that is already there...This is the decorator counterpart of my original code.writer.py remains the same:mymodule.py sligthly gets modified:And here is the decorator:Starting with Python 3 you can also use sys.stdout.buffer.write() to write (already) encoded byte strings to stdout (see stdout in Python 3).

When you do that, the simple StringIO approach doesn't work because neither sys.stdout.encoding nor sys.stdout.buffer would be available.Starting with Python 2.6 you can use the TextIOBase API, which includes the missing attributes:This solution works for Python 2 >= 2.6 and Python 3.

Please note that our sys.stdout.write() only accepts unicode strings and sys.stdout.buffer.write() only accepts byte strings.

This might not be the case for old code, but is often the case for code that is built to run on Python 2 and 3 without changes.If you need to support code that sends byte strings to stdout directly without using stdout.buffer, you can use this variation:You don't have to set the encoding of the buffer the sys.stdout.encoding, but this helps when using this method for testing/comparing script output.The question here (the example of how to redirect output, not the tee part) uses os.dup2 to redirect a stream at the OS level.  That is nice because it will apply to commands that you spawn from your program as well.I think You should look at these four objects:Example:UPD: As Eric said in a comment, one shouldn't use they directly, so I copied and pasted it.I like the contextmanager solution however if you need the buffer stored with the open file and fileno support you could do something like this.use

However, you need to explicitly enable it, withsomewhere near the top of your fabfile. Once you do this, Fabric should read your ssh config (from ~/.ssh/config by default, or from env.ssh_config_path).One warning: if you use a version older than 1.5.4, an abort will occur if env.use_ssh_config is set but there is no config file present. In that case, you can use a workaround like:Note that this also happens when the name is not in /etc/hosts. I had the same problem and had to add the host name to both that file and ~/.ssh/config.update: This Answer is now outdated.Fabric doesn't have support currently for the .ssh/config file. You can set these up in a function to then call on the cli, eg: fab production task; where production sets the username, hostname, port, and ssh identity. As for rsync project, that should now have port setting ability, if not, you can always run local("rsync ...") as that is essentially what that contributed function does.One can use following code to read the config (original code taken from: http://markpasc.typepad.com/blog/2010/04/loading-ssh-config-settings-for-fabric.html):

ConfigParser will throw a NoSectionError exception, and will not accept the file.How can I make ConfigParser simply retrieve the (key, value) tuples of a config file without section names? For instance:I would rather not write to the config file.Alex Martelli provided a solution for using ConfigParser to parse .properties files (which are apparently section-less config files).His solution is a file-like wrapper that will automagically insert a dummy section heading to satisfy ConfigParser's requirements.Enlightened by this answer by jterrace, I come up with this solution:

EDIT for future googlers: As of Python 3.4+ readfp is deprecated, and StringIO is not needed anymore. Instead we can use read_string directly:You can do this in a single line of code.In python 3, prepend a fake section header to your config file data, and pass it to read_string().You could also use itertools.chain() to simulate a section header for read_file(). This might be more memory-efficient than the above approach, which might be helpful if you have large config files in a constrained runtime environment.In python 2, prepend a fake section header to your config file data, wrap the result in a StringIO object, and pass it to readfp().With any of these approaches, your config settings will be available in parser.items('top').You could use StringIO in python 3 as well, perhaps for compatibility with both old and new python interpreters, but note that it now lives in the io package and readfp() is now deprecated.Alternatively, you might consider using a TOML parser instead of ConfigParser.You can use the ConfigObj library to do that simply : http://www.voidspace.org.uk/python/configobj.htmlUpdated: Find latest code here.If you are under Debian/Ubuntu, you can install this module using your package manager :An example of use:The easiest way to do this is to use python's CSV parser, in my opinion.  Here's a read/write function demonstrating this approach as well as a test driver. This should work provided the values are not allowed to be multi-line.  :)Having ran into this problem myself, I wrote a complete wrapper to ConfigParser (the version in Python 2) that can read and write files without sections transparently, based on Alex Martelli's approach linked on the accepted answer. It should be a drop-in replacement to any usage of ConfigParser. Posting it in case anyone in need of that finds this page. Blueicefield's answer mentioned configobj, but the original lib only supports Python 2. It now has a Python 3+ compatible port: https://github.com/DiffSK/configobjAPIs haven't changed, see it's doc.

The other keys mentioned also existed, but Windows was using this one for some reason.For Python 3.3 on Windows 7, my setting was under another registry key; the key I changed to make the arguments get passed wasHKEY_USERS\S-1-5-21-3922133726-554333396-2662258059-1000_Classes\py_auto_file\shell\open\commandIt was "C:\Python\Python33\python.exe" "%1".

The key's value is now "C:\Python\Python33\python.exe" "%1" %*.I had several (at least five) other keys with the value "C:\Python\Python33\python.exe" "%1", but this is the one I changed that made it work.To make it working for me, I had to use the registry path:and added a %*Here are .reg files to fix for Python 3.6, 2.7 and Anaconda3:python-3.6.0.regpython-2.7.0.regananconda3.reg (change username)Interesting.

There's a great tutorial here - it's usually the one I send to new Twisty's :-)http://krondo.com/blog/?page_id=1327Its worth remembering that Twisted programming is more of a thinking paradigm than a programming one.

I'm increasingly hearing that Python's Twisted framework rocks and other frameworks pale in comparison.Can anybody shed some light on this and possibly compare Twisted with other network programming frameworks.There are a lot of different aspects of Twisted that you might find cool.Twisted includes lots and lots of protocol implementations, meaning that more likely than not there will be an API you can use to talk to some remote system (either client or server in most cases) - be it HTTP, FTP, SMTP, POP3, IMAP4, DNS, IRC, MSN, OSCAR, XMPP/Jabber, telnet, SSH, SSL, NNTP, or one of the really obscure protocols like Finger, or ident, or one of the lower level protocol-building-protocols like DJB's netstrings, simple line-oriented protocols, or even one of Twisted's custom protocols like Perspective Broker (PB) or Asynchronous Messaging Protocol (AMP).Another cool thing about Twisted is that on top of these low-level protocol implementations, you'll often find an abstraction that's somewhat easier to use.  For example, when writing an HTTP server, Twisted Web provides a "Resource" abstraction which lets you construct URL hierarchies out of Python objects to define how requests will be responded to.All of this is tied together with cooperating APIs, mainly due to the fact that none of this functionality is implemented by blocking on the network, so you don't need to start a thread for every operation you want to do.  This contributes to the scalability that people often attribute to Twisted (although it is the kind of scalability that only involves a single computer, not the kind of scalability that lets your application grow to use a whole cluster of hosts) because Twisted can handle thousands of connections in a single thread, which tends to work better than having thousands of threads, each for a single connection.Avoiding threading is also beneficial for testing and debugging (and hence reliability in general).  Since there is no pre-emptive context switching in a typical Twisted-based program, you generally don't need to worry about locking.  Race conditions that depend on the order of different network events happening can easily be unit tested by simulating those network events (whereas simulating a context switch isn't a feature provided by most (any?) threading libraries).Twisted is also really, really concerned with quality.  So you'll rarely find regressions in a Twisted release, and most of the APIs just work, even if you aren't using them in the common way (because we try to test all the ways you might use them, not just the common way).  This is particularly true for all of the code added to Twisted (or modified) in the last 3 or 4 years, since 100% line coverage has been a minimum testing requirement since then.Another often overlooked strength of Twisted is its ten years of figuring out different platform quirks.  There are lots of undocumented socket errors on different platforms and it's really hard to learn that they even exist, let alone handle them.  Twisted has gradually covered more and more of these, and it's pretty good about it at this point.  Younger projects don't have this experience, so they miss obscure failure modes that will probably only happen to users of any project you release, not to you.All that say, what I find coolest about Twisted is that it's a pretty boring library that lets me ignore a lot of really boring problems and just focus on the interesting and fun things. :)Well it's probably according to taste. Twisted allows you to easily create event driven network servers/clients, without really worrying about everything that goes into accomplishing this. And thanks to the MIT License, Twisted can be used almost anywhere. But I haven't done any benchmarking so I have no idea how it scales, but I'm guessing quite good.Another plus would be the Twisted Projects, with which you can quickly see how to implement most of the server/services that you would want to.Twisted also has some great documentation, when I started with it a couple of weeks ago I was able to quickly get a working prototype.Quite new to the python scene please correct me if i'm in the wrong.

I need to write a script that connects to a bunch of sites on our corporate intranet over HTTPS and verifies that their SSL certificates are valid; that they are not expired, that they are issued for the correct address, etc.  We use our own internal corporate Certificate Authority for these sites, so we have the public key of the CA to verify the certificates against.Python by default just accepts and uses SSL certificates when using HTTPS, so even if a certificate is invalid, Python libraries such as urllib2 and Twisted will just happily use the certificate.Is there a good library somewhere that will let me connect to a site over HTTPS and verify its certificate in this way?How do I verify a certificate in Python?From release version 2.7.9/3.4.3 on, Python by default attempts to perform certificate validation.This has been proposed in PEP 467, which is worth a read: https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0476/The changes affect all relevant stdlib modules (urllib/urllib2, http, httplib).Relevant documentation:https://docs.python.org/2/library/httplib.html#httplib.HTTPSConnectionhttps://docs.python.org/3/library/http.client.html#http.client.HTTPSConnectionNote that the new built-in verification is based on the system-provided certificate database. Opposed to that, the requests package ships its own certificate bundle. Pros and cons of both approaches are discussed in the Trust database section of PEP 476.I have added a distribution to the Python Package Index which makes the match_hostname() function from the Python 3.2 ssl package available on previous versions of Python.http://pypi.python.org/pypi/backports.ssl_match_hostname/You can install it with:Or you can make it a dependency listed in your project's setup.py. Either way, it can be used like this:You can use Twisted to verify certificates.  The main API is CertificateOptions, which can be provided as the contextFactory argument to various functions such as listenSSL and startTLS.Unfortunately, neither Python nor Twisted comes with a the pile of CA certificates required to actually do HTTPS validation, nor the HTTPS validation logic.  Due to a limitation in PyOpenSSL, you can't do it completely correctly just yet, but thanks to the fact that almost all certificates include a subject commonName, you can get close enough.Here is a naive sample implementation of a verifying Twisted HTTPS client which ignores wildcards and subjectAltName extensions, and uses the certificate-authority certificates present in the 'ca-certificates' package in most Ubuntu distributions.  Try it with your favorite valid and invalid certificate sites :).PycURL does this beautifully.Below is a short example. It will throw a pycurl.error if something is fishy, where you get a tuple with error code and a human readable message.You will probably want to configure more options, like where to store the results, etc. But no need to clutter the example with non-essentials.Example of what exceptions might be raised:Some links that I found useful are the libcurl-docs for setopt and getinfo.Here's an example script which demonstrates certificate validation:Or simply make your life easier by using the requests library:A few more words about its usage.M2Crypto can do the validation. You can also use M2Crypto with Twisted if you like. The Chandler desktop client uses Twisted for networking and M2Crypto for SSL, including certificate validation.Based on Glyphs comment it seems like M2Crypto does better certificate verification by default than what you can do with pyOpenSSL currently, because M2Crypto checks subjectAltName field too.I've also blogged on how to get the certificates Mozilla Firefox ships with in Python and usable with Python SSL solutions.Jython DOES carry out certificate verification by default, so using standard library modules, e.g. httplib.HTTPSConnection, etc, with jython will verify certificates and give exceptions for failures, i.e. mismatched identities, expired certs, etc.In fact, you have to do some extra work to get jython to behave like cpython, i.e. to get jython to NOT verify certs. I have written a blog post on how to disable certificate checking on jython, because it can be useful in testing phases, etc.Installing an all-trusting security provider on java and jython.

http://jython.xhaus.com/installing-an-all-trusting-security-provider-on-java-and-jython/The following code allows you to benefit from all SSL validation checks (e.g. date validity, CA certificate chain ...) EXCEPT a pluggable verification step e.g. to verify the hostname or do other additional certificate verification steps.pyOpenSSL is an interface to the OpenSSL library. It should provide everything you need.I was having the same problem but wanted to minimize 3rd party dependencies (because this one-off script was to be executed by many users). My solution was to wrap a curl call and make sure that the exit code was 0. Worked like a charm.

Windows XP, Python 2.5:Google App Engine (http://shell.appspot.com/):Why is that? How can I have a hash function that will give me same results across different platforms (Windows, Linux, Mac)? Use hashlib as hash() was designed to be used to:and therefore does not guarantee that it will be the same across Python implementations.As stated in the documentation, built-in hash() function is not designed for storing resulting hashes somewhere externally. It is used to provide object's hash value, to store them in dictionaries and so on. It's also implementation-specific (GAE uses a modified version of Python). Check out:As you can see, they are different, as hash() uses object's __hash__ method instead of 'normal' hashing algorithms, such as SHA.Given the above, the rational choice is to use the hashlib module.The response is absolutely no surprise: in fact so if you want to get reliable responses on ASCII strings, just get the lower 32 bits as uint. The hash function for strings is 32-bit-safe and almost portable.On the other side, you can't rely at all on getting the hash() of any object over which you haven't explicitly defined the __hash__ method to be invariant. Over ASCII strings it works just because the hash is calculated on the single characters forming the string, like the following:where the c_mul function is the "cyclic" multiplication (without overflow) as in C.Most answers suggest this is because of different platforms, but there is more to it. From the documentation of object.__hash__(self):Even running on the same machine will yield varying results across invocations:While:See also the environment variable PYTHONHASHSEED:For example:Hash results varies between 32bit and 64bit platformsIf a calculated hash shall be the same on both platforms consider usingAt a guess, AppEngine is using a 64-bit implementation of Python (-5768830964305142685 won't fit in 32 bits) and your implementation of Python is 32 bits. You can't rely on object hashes being meaningfully comparable between different implementations.This is the hash function that Google uses in production for python 2.5:What about sign bit?For example:Hex value 0xADFE74A5 represents unsigned 2919134373 and signed -1375832923.

Currect value must be signed (sign bit = 1) but python converts it as unsigned and we have an incorrect hash value after translation from 64 to 32 bit.Be careful using:Polynomial hash for strings. 1000000009 and 239 are arbitrary prime numbers. Unlikely to have collisions by accident. Modular arithmetic is not very fast, but for preventing collisions this is more reliable than taking it modulo a power of 2. Of course, it is easy to find a collision on purpose.The value of PYTHONHASHSEED might be used to initialize the hash values.Try:It probably just asks the operating system provided function, rather than its own algorithm. As other comments says, use hashlib or write your own hash function.

I have a decorator like below.I want to enhance this decorator to accept another argument like belowBut this code gives the error,Why is the function not automatically passed? How do I explicitly pass the function to the decorator function?Since you are calling the decorator like a function, it needs to return another function which is the actual decorator:The outer function will be given any arguments you pass explicitly, and should return the inner function. The inner function will be passed the function to decorate, and return the modified function.Usually you want the decorator to change the function behavior by wrapping it in a wrapper function. Here's an example that optionally adds logging when the function is called:The functools.wraps call copies things like the name and docstring to the wrapper function, to make it more similar to the original function.Example usage:Just to provide a different viewpoint: the syntaxis equivalent to In particular, expr can be anything you like, as long as it evaluates to a callable. In particular particular, expr can be a decorator factory: you give it some parameters and it gives you a decorator. So maybe a better way to understand your situation is aswhich can then be shortened toOf course, since it looks like decorator_factory is a decorator, people tend to name it to reflect that. Which can be confusing when you try to follow the levels of indirection.Just want to add some usefull trick that will allow to make decorator arguments optional. It will also alows to reuse decorator and decrease nestingJust another way of doing decorators.

Counterintuitive behaviour of int() in python

It's clearly stated in the docs that int(number) is a flooring type conversion:and int(string) returns an int if and only if the string is an integer literal.Is there any special reason for that? I find it counterintuitive that the function floors in one case, but not the other.There is no special reason. Python is simply applying its general principle of not performing implicit conversions, which are well-known causes of problems, particularly for newcomers, in languages such as Perl and Javascript.int(some_string) is an explicit request to convert a string to integer format; the rules for this conversion specify that the string must contain a valid integer literal representation. int(float) is an explicit request to convert a float to an integer; the rules for this conversion specify that the float's fractional portion will be truncated.In order for int("3.1459") to return 3 the interpreter would have to implicitly convert the string to a float. Since Python doesn't support implicit conversions, it chooses to raise an exception instead.This is almost certainly a case of applying three of the principles from the Zen of Python: Some percentage of the time, someone doing int('1.23') is calling the wrong conversion for their use case, and wants something like float or decimal.Decimal instead. In these cases, it's clearly better for them to get an immediate error that they can fix, rather than silently giving the wrong value. In the case that you do want to truncate that to an int, it is trivial to explicitly do so by passing it through float first, and then calling one of int, round, trunc, floor or ceil as appropriate. This also makes your code more self-documenting, guarding against a later modification "correcting" a hypothetical silently-truncating int call to float by making it clear that the rounded value is what you want.Sometimes a thought experiment can be useful.With behavior A, it's straightforward and trivial to get the effect of behavior B: use int(float('1.23')) instead.On the other hand, with behavior B, getting the effect of behavior A is significantly more complicated:(and even with the code above, I don't have complete confidence that there isn't some corner case that it mishandles.)Behavior A therefore is more expressive than behavior B.Another thing to consider: '1.23' is a string representation of a floating-point value.  Converting '1.23' to an integer conceptually involves two conversions (string to float to integer), but int(1.23) and int('1') each involve only one conversion.Edit:And indeed, there are corner cases that the above code would not handle: 1e-2 and 1E-2 are both floating point values too.In simple words - they're not the same function. They are 2 different functions with the same name that return an integer but they are different functions.'int' is short and easy to remember and its meaning applied to each type is intuitive to most programmers which is why they chose it. There's no implication they are providing the same or combined functionality, they simply have the same name and return the same type. They could as easily be called 'floorDecimalAsInt' and 'convertStringToInt', but they went for 'int' because it's easy to remember, (99%) intuitive and confusion would rarely occur.Parsing text as an Integer for text which included a decimal point such as "4.5" would throw an error in majority of computer languages and be expected to throw an error by majority of programmers, since the text-value does not represent an integer and implies they are providing erroneous data

Here is the error:You can do it in two lines by first plotting the bar chart and then setting the appropriate ticks:Note that the penultimate line should read plt.xticks(range(len(D)), list(D.keys())) in python3, because D.keys() returns a generator, which matplotlib cannot use directly.For future reference, the above code does not work with Python 3. For Python 3, the D.keys() needs to be converted to a list.It's a little simpler than most answers here suggest:The best way to implement it using matplotlib.pyplot.bar(range, height, tick_label) where the range provides scalar values for the positioning of the corresponding bar in the graph. tick_label does the same work as xticks(). One can replace it with an integer also and use multiple plt.bar(integer, height, tick_label). For detailed information please refer the documentation. Additionally the same plot can be generated without using range(). But the problem encountered was that tick_label just worked for the last plt.bar() call. Hence xticks() was used for labelling:I often load the dict into a pandas DataFrame then use the plot function of the DataFrame.

Perhaps an easier-to-understand example is the slightly simplerNote that the array you pass as c doesn't need to have any particular order or type, i.e. it doesn't need to be sorted or integers as in these examples.  The plotting routine will scale the colormap such that the minimum/maximum values in c correspond to the bottom/top of the colormap.You can change the colormap by addingImporting matplotlib.cm is optional as you can call colormaps as cmap="cmap_name" just as well.  There is a reference page of colormaps showing what each looks like.  Also know that you can reverse a colormap by simply calling it as cmap_name_r.  So eitherwill work.  Examples are "jet_r" or cm.plasma_r.  Here's an example with the new 1.5 colormap viridis:You can add a colorbar by usingNote that if you are using figures and subplots explicitly (e.g. fig, ax = plt.subplots() or ax = fig.add_subplot(111)), adding a colorbar can be a bit more involved. Good examples can be found here for a single subplot colorbar and here for 2 subplots 1 colorbar.To add to wflynny's answer above, you can find the available colormaps hereExample:

or alternatively,

Subplot ColorbarFor subplots with scatter, you can trick a colorbar onto your axes by building the "mappable" with the help of a secondary figure and then adding it to your original plot.As a continuation of the above example:Note that you will also output a secondary figure that you can ignore.

Furthermore, you could convert offset-awared datetime to offset-naive datetime by stripping off timezone info, then it could be compared w/ normal datetime.datetime.now(), under utc.USE_TZ is True 'by default' (actually it's False by default, but the settings.py file generated by django-admin.py startproject set it to True), then if your DB supports timezone-aware times, values of time-related model fields would be timezone-aware. you could disable it by setting USE_TZ=False(or simply remove USE_TZ=True) in settings.

I am trying to do this:But that's not right...the documentation is vague...how do you do this in Jinja2?As of version 2.6, Jinja2's built-in sort filter allows you to specify an attribute to sort by:See http://jinja.pocoo.org/docs/templates/#sortIf you want to sort in ascending orderIf you want to sort in descending orderUsually we sort the list before giving it to Jinja2.  There's no way to specify a key in Jinja's sort filter.However, you can always try {% for movie in movie_list|sort %}.  That's the syntax.  You don't get to provide any sort of key information for the sorting.You can also try and write a custom filter for this.  Seems silly when you can sort before giving the data to Jinja2.If movie_list is a list of objects, then you can define the various comparison methods (__lt__, __gt__, etc.) for the class of those objects.If movie_list is a list of tuples or lists, the rating must be first.  Or you'll have to do the sorting outside Jinja2.If movie_list is a list of dictionaries, then you can use dictsort, which does accept a key specification for the sorting.

Is there a way to modify the PATH environment variable in a platform independent way using python?Something similar to os.path.join()?You should be able to modify os.environ.Since os.pathsep is the character to separate different paths, you should use this to append each new path:or, if there are several paths to add in a list:As you mentioned, os.path.join can also be used for each individual path you have to append in the case you have to construct them from separate parts.Please note that os.environ is not actually a dictionary.  It's a special dictionary-like object which actually sets environment variables in the current process using setenv.This means that PATH (and other environment variables) will be visible to C code run in the same process.(Since comments can't contain formatting, I have to put this in an answer, but I feel like it's an important point to make.  This is really a comment on the comment about there being no equivalent to 'export'.)The caveat to be aware of with modifying environment variables in Python, is that there is no equivalent of the "export" shell command.

I have a Dictionary below:How do I index the first entry in the dictionary?colors[0] will return a KeyError for obvious reasons.

2010-12-01 16:40:16Z

I have a Dictionary below:How do I index the first entry in the dictionary?colors[0] will return a KeyError for obvious reasons.Dictionaries are unordered in Python versions up to and including Python 3.6.  If you do not care about the order of the entries and want to access the keys or values by index anyway, you can use d.keys()[i] and d.values()[i] or d.items()[i].  (Note that these methods create a list of all keys, values or items in Python 2.x.  So if you need them more then once, store the list in a variable to improve performance.)If you do care about the order of the entries, starting with Python 2.7 you can use collections.OrderedDict.  Or use a list of pairsif you don't need access by key.  (Why are your numbers strings by the way?)In Python 3.7, normal dictionaries are ordered, so you don't need to use OrderedDict anymore (but you still can – it's basically the same type).  The CPython implementation of Python 3.6 already included that change, but since it's not part of the language specification, you can't rely on it in Python 3.6.If anybody still looking at this question, the currently accepted answer is now outdated:Since Python 3.7* the dictionaries are order-preserving, that is they now behave exactly as collections.OrderedDicts used to. Unfortunately, there is still no dedicated method to index into keys() / values() of the dictionary, so getting the first key / value in the dictionary can be done asor alternatively (this avoids instantiating the keys view into a list):If you need an n-th key, then similarly(*CPython 3.6 already included ordered dicts, but this was only an implementation detail. The language specification includes ordered dicts from 3.7 onwards.)Addressing an element of dictionary is like sitting on donkey and enjoy the ride.As rule of Python DICTIONARY is orderlessIf there isNow suppose if I go like dic[10] = "b", then it will not add like this alwaysIt may be likeOrOrOr any such combination.So thumb rule is DICTIONARY is orderless!If you need an ordered dictionary, you can use odict.actually I found a novel solution that really helped me out,  If you are especially concerned with the index of a certain value in a list or data set, you can just set the value of dictionary to that Index!:Just watch:Now through the power of hashmaps you can pull the index your entries in constant time (aka a whole lot faster)oh, that's a tough one. What you have here, basically, is two values for each item. Then you are trying to call them with a number as the key. Unfortunately, one of your values is already set as the key!Try this:Now you can call the keys by number as if they are indexed like a list. You can also reference the color and number by their position within the list.For example,Of course, you will have to come up with another way of keeping track of what location each color is in. Maybe you can have another dictionary that stores each color's key as it's value.Then, you will be able to also look up the colors key if you need to.colors[colors_key['blue']][0] will return 'blue'Something like that.And then, while you're at it, you can make a dict with the number values as keys so that you can always use them to look up your colors, you know, if you need.Then, (colors[colors_key[values[5][1]]][0]) will return 'blue'.Or you could use a list of lists.Good luck!You can't, since dict is unordered. you can use .popitem() to get an arbitrary item, but that will remove it from the dict.

How do you create a Bash script to activate a Python virtualenv?I have a directory structure like:I can activate my virtualenv by:However, doing the same from a Bash script does nothing:What am I doing wrong?When you source, you're loading the activate script into your active shell.When you do it in a script, you load it into that shell which exits when your script finishes and you're back to your original, unactivated shell.Your best option would be to do it in a functionor an aliasHope this helps.You should call the bash script using source.Here is an example:On your shell just call it like that:Or as @outmind suggested: (Note that this does not work with zsh)There you go, the shell indication will be placed on your prompt.Although it doesn't add the "(.env)" prefix to the shell prompt, I found this script works as expected.e.g.Sourcing runs shell commands in your current shell.  When you source inside of a script like you are doing above, you are affecting the environment for that script, but when the script exits, the environment changes are undone, as they've effectively gone out of scope.If your intent is to run shell commands in the virtualenv, you can do that in your script after sourcing the activate script.  If your intent is to interact with a shell inside the virtualenv, then you can spawn a sub-shell inside your script which would inherit the environment.You can also do this using a subshell to better contain your usage - here's a practical example:This style is especially helpful whenWhat does sourcing the bash script for?You should use multiple commands in one line. for example:when you activate your virtual environment in one line, I think it forgets for other command lines and you can prevent this by using multiple commands in one line.

It worked for me :)Here is the script that I use often. Run it as $ source script_name

I want to access some .NET assemblies written in C# from Python code. A little research showed I have two choices:What are the trade-offs between both solutions?If you want to mainly base your code on the .NET framework, I'd highly recommend IronPython vs Python.NET.  IronPython is pretty much native .NET - so it just works great when integrating with other .NET langauges.  Python.NET is good if you want to just integrate one or two components from .NET into a standard python application.There are notable differences when using IronPython - but most of them are fairly subtle.  Python.NET uses the standard CPython runtime, so this Wiki page is a relevant discussion of the differences between the two implementations.  The largest differences occur in the cost of exceptions - so some of the standard python libraries don't perform as well in IronPython due to their implementation.While agreeing with the answers given by Reed Copsey and Alex Martelli, I'd like to point out one further difference - the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL). While IronPython doesn't have the limitations of the GIL, CPython does - so it would appear that for those applications where the GIL is a bottleneck, say in certain multicore scenarios, IronPython has an advantage over Python.NET.From the Python.NET documentation:Another issue is IDE support. CPython probably has better IDE support at present than IronPython - so this may be a factor in the choosing of one over the other.Most of scientific and numerical Python libraries that rely on CPython C-API (numpy, scipy, matplotlib, pandas, cython, etc.) are working mostly under CPython, so in that case your best bet is pythonnet (other names - Python.NET and Python for .NET).

The same is true for CPython GUI bindings such as WxWidgets, PyQt/PySide, GTK, Kivy, etc., although both pythonnet and IronPython can use WPF and WinForms.And finally IronPython does not fully support Python 3 yet.IronPython is ".NET-native" -- so it will be preferable if you want to fully integrate your Python code with .NET all the way; Python.NET works with Classic Python, so it lets you keep your Python code's "arm's length" away from .NET proper.  (Note that with this code you can actually use extensions written for CPython from your IronPython code, so that's not a discriminating condition any more).IronPython comes from Microsoft, so I would go with my gut and use that one first since you have to assume it will play nicer with other MSFT technologies.  As for 2016. In my company we used IronPython, but we were not satisfied with performances (mostly memory use - garbage collector was too slow) so we decided to switch to standard Python and integrate it with .Net using Zeroce-s ICE. IronPython, currently,  doesn't support Python 3.6 (only 2.7)from IronPython 3 "Builds of IronPython 3 are not yet provided."A funny, simple and powerful language regardless what you choose!Iron Python is basically Python 2.7 with integrated .net support it probably will never support Python 3. It loses out on C and Python libraries, however on the twist side has access to .net and can be extended with C#. So if you use C# already then Iron Python is a bonus.I mainly prefer Python for .NET, because IronPython is compiled as managed code, which can be easily decompiled (what I most hate), but with py2exe or pyinstaller you can compile Python with NET module as an unmanaged application.

I tried putting the version number 1.0.7 into this command in various ways, but nothing worked.How do I do this?There was never a Django 1.0.7. The 1.0 series only went up to 1.0.4. You can see all the releases in the tags section of the Django code repository.However to answer your question, don't use easy_install, use pip. (If it's not already installed, do easy_install pip, then never touch easy_install again). Now you can do:+1 on the previous poster's reply: use pip if you can. But, in a pinch, the easiest way is to install an older version would be to download the tarball from the downloads page or, if you have subversion installed, do an svn export of the release you want (they are all tagged here).

When I do a "pip install -e ..." to install from a git repo, I have to specify #egg=somename or pip complains. For example:What's the significance of this "egg" string?per pip install -h the "egg" string is the directory that gets checked out as part of the installYou have to include #egg=Package so pip knows what to expect at that URL. See https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/reference/pip_install/#vcs-supportmore on eggshttps://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/reference/pip_install/#vcs-support says:From this I deduce that the egg value is only used for dependency checks and therefore I think, by convention, the package name (i.e. some-pypi-package-name) should be used, not any contained folder (i.e. some_pypi_package_name)An Egg is just some bundled python code. In a git url, the egg is the project name.  VCS Support Normally we install python packages from Pypi, so you specify ONLY the package name and version (or it assumes latest version if you don't specify). Pypi then searches for which egg you want and pip installs that.  pip install celery would install the latest published egg and pip install celery[redis] would install a different egg that contains the same celery package and also installs the the latest eggs from whatever packages were listed as dependencies for redis in celery's setup.py.With git and gitlab paths, you specify /{user|group}/{repository}.git@{tag}#egg={package-name}. there is a difference between #egg=celery and #egg=celery[redis], but they will both come from the same source code. "tag" can also be a branch or commit hash in addition to an actual tag. It is assumed to be master if you do not specify.for example, git+https://github.com/celery/celery.git#egg=celery==4.3.0 would check out the master branch and install that. Even though you specified a version number, it is not taken into account in the installation. THE VERSION NUMBER IS IGNOREDWhen installing via git or other VCS urls, you will want to find the tag or hash of the version you need. For example, git+https://github.com/celery/celery.git@v4.3.0#egg=celery which will checkout the commit tagged "v4.3.0" and then install the package from that source code.  Assuming the maintainers did not egregiously mis-tag their repositories, you can get the version you want like that.

Now, we tone down the whole image, except the region or interest:And we get !You could try template matching, and then taking down which produced the highest resemblance, and then using machine learning to narrow it more. That is also very difficult, and with the accuracy of template matching, it may just return every face or face-like image. I am thinking you will need more than just machine learning if you hope to do this consistently.maybe you should start with breaking the problem into two smaller ones:those are still two very big problems to tackle...BTW, I would choose c++ and open CV, it seems much more suited for this.This is not impossible but very difficult because you really have no example of a successful match. There are often multiple states(in this case, more examples of find walleys drawings), you can then feed multiple pictures into an image reconization program and treat it as a hidden markov model and use something like the viterbi algorithm for inference ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viterbi_algorithm ).Thats the way I would approach it, but assuming you have multiple images that you can give it examples of the correct answer so it can learn.  If you only have one picture, then I'm sorry there maybe another approach you need to take.I recognized that there are two main features which are almost always visible:So I would do it the following way:search for striped shirts:If there are more than one 'shirts', to say, more than one clusters of positive correlation, search for other features, like the dark brown hair:search for brown hairHere's a solution using neural networks that works nicely.The neural network is trained on several solved examples that are marked with bounding boxes indicating where Wally appears in the picture. The goal of the network is to minimize the error between the predicted box and the actual box from training/validation data.The network above uses Tensorflow Object Detection API to perform training and predictions.

How can Python interpreter in principle, be aware of this happening?Before answering this question we need to understand a few base terms, skip these if you already know any of them.Generators are objects that allow us to suspend the execution of a python function. User curated generators are implement using the keyword yield. By creating a normal function containing the yield keyword, we turn that function into a generator:As you can see, calling next() on the generator causes the interpreter to load test's frame, and return the yielded value. Calling next() again, cause the frame to load again into the interpreter stack, and continue on yielding another value.By the third time next() is called, our generator was finished, and StopIteration was thrown.A less-known feature of generators, is the fact that you can communicate with them using two methods: send() and throw().Upon calling gen.send(), the value is passed as a return value from the yield keyword.gen.throw() on the other hand, allows throwing Exceptions inside generators, with the exception raised at the same spot yield was called.Returning a value from a generator, results in the value being put inside the StopIteration exception. We can later on recover the value from the exception and use it to our need.Python 3.4 came with the addition of a new keyword: yield from. What that keyword allows us to do, is pass on any next(), send() and throw() into an inner-most nested generator. If the inner generator returns a value, it is also the return value of yield from:Upon introducing the new keyword yield from in Python 3.4, we were now able to create generators inside generators that just like a tunnel, pass the data back and forth from the inner-most to the outer-most generators.  This has spawned a new meaning for generators - coroutines.Coroutines are functions that can be stopped and resumed while being run. In Python, they are defined using the async def keyword. Much like generators, they too use their own form of yield from which is await. Before async and await were introduced in Python 3.5, we created coroutines in the exact same way generators were created (with yield from instead of await).Like every iterator or generator that implement the __iter__() method, coroutines implement __await__() which allows them to continue on every time await coro is called.There's a nice sequence diagram inside the Python docs that you should check out.In asyncio, apart from coroutine functions, we have 2 important objects: tasks and futures.Futures are objects that have the __await__() method implemented, and their job is to hold a certain state and result. The state can be one of the following:The result, just like you have guessed, can either be a Python object, that will be returned, or an exception which may be raised.Another important feature of future objects, is that they contain a method called add_done_callback(). This method allows functions to be called as soon as the task is done - whether it raised an exception or finished.Task objects are special futures, which wrap around coroutines, and communicate with the inner-most and outer-most coroutines. Every time a coroutine awaits a future, the future is passed all the way back to the task (just like in yield from), and the task receives it.Next, the task binds itself to the future. It does so by calling add_done_callback() on the future. From now on, if the future will ever be done, by either being cancelled, passed an exception or passed a Python object as a result, the task's callback will be called, and it will rise back up to existence.The final burning question we must answer is - how is the IO implemented?Deep inside asyncio, we have an event loop. An event loop of tasks. The event loop's job is to call tasks every time they are ready and coordinate all that effort into one single working machine.The IO part of the event loop is built upon a single crucial function called select. Select is a blocking function, implemented by the operating system underneath, that allows waiting on sockets for incoming or outgoing data. Upon data being received it wakes up, and returns the sockets which received data, or the sockets whom are ready for writing.When you try to receive or send data over a socket through asyncio, what actually happens below is that the socket is first checked if it has any data that can be immediately read or sent. If it's .send() buffer is full, or the .recv() buffer is empty, the socket is registered to the select function (by simply adding it to one of the lists, rlist for recv and wlist for send) and the appropriate function awaits a newly created future object, tied to that socket.When all available tasks are waiting for futures, the event loop calls select and waits. When the one of the sockets has incoming data, or it's send buffer drained up, asyncio checks for the future object tied to that socket, and sets it to done.Now all the magic happens. The future is set to done, the task that added itself before with add_done_callback() rises up back to life, and calls .send() on the coroutine which resumes the inner-most coroutine (because of the await chain) and you read the newly received data from a nearby buffer it was spilled unto.Method chain again, in case of recv():In summary, asyncio uses generator capabilities, that allow pausing and resuming functions. It uses yield from capabilities that allow passing data back and forth from the inner-most generator to the outer-most. It uses all of those in order to halt function execution while it's waiting for IO to complete (by using the OS select function).And the best of all? While one function is paused, another may run and interleave with the delicate fabric, which is asyncio.Talking about async/await and asyncio is not the same thing. The first is a fundamental, low-level construct (coroutines) while the later is a library using these constructs. Conversely, there is no single ultimate answer.The following is a general description of how async/await and asyncio-like libraries work. That is, there may be other tricks on top (there are...) but they are inconsequential unless you build them yourself. The difference should be negligible unless you already know enough to not have to ask such a question.Just like subroutines (functions, procedures, ...), coroutines (generators, ...) are an abstraction of call stack and instruction pointer: there is a stack of executing code pieces, and each is at a specific instruction.The distinction of def versus async def is merely for clarity. The actual difference is return versus yield. From this, await or yield from take the difference from individual calls to entire stacks.A subroutine represents a new stack level to hold local variables, and a single traversal of its instructions to reach an end. Consider a subroutine like this:When you run it, that meansNotably, 4. means that a subroutine always starts at the same state. Everything exclusive to the function itself is lost upon completion. A function cannot be resumed, even if there are instructions after return.A coroutine is like a subroutine, but can exit without destroying its state. Consider a coroutine like this:When you run it, that meansNote the addition of 2.1 and 2.2 - a coroutine can be suspended and resumed at predefined points. This is similar to how a subroutine is suspended during calling another subroutine. The difference is that the active coroutine is not strictly bound to its calling stack. Instead, a suspended coroutine is part of a separate, isolated stack.This means that suspended coroutines can be freely stored or moved between stacks. Any call stack that has access to a coroutine can decide to resume it.So far, our coroutine only goes down the call stack with yield. A subroutine can go down and up the call stack with return and (). For completeness, coroutines also need a mechanism to go up the call stack. Consider a coroutine like this:When you run it, that means it still allocates the stack and instruction pointer like a subroutine. When it suspends, that still is like storing a subroutine.However, yield from does both. It suspends stack and instruction pointer of wrap and runs cofoo. Note that wrap stays suspended until cofoo finishes completely. Whenever cofoo suspends or something is sent, cofoo is directly connected to the calling stack.As established, yield from allows to connect two scopes across another intermediate one. When applied recursively, that means the top of the stack can be connected to the bottom of the stack.Note that root and coro_b do not know about each other. This makes coroutines much cleaner than callbacks: coroutines still built on a 1:1 relation like subroutines. Coroutines suspend and resume their entire existing execution stack up until a regular call point.Notably, root could have an arbitrary number of coroutines to resume. Yet, it can never resume more than one at the same time. Coroutines of the same root are concurrent but not parallel!The explanation has so far explicitly used the yield and yield from vocabulary of generators - the underlying functionality is the same. The new Python3.5 syntax async and await exists mainly for clarity.The async for and async with statements are needed because you would break the yield from/await chain with the bare for and with statements.By itself, a coroutine has no concept of yielding control to another coroutine. It can only yield control to the caller at the bottom of a coroutine stack. This caller can then switch to another coroutine and run it.This root node of several coroutines is commonly an event loop: on suspension, a coroutine yields an event on which it wants resume. In turn, the event loop is capable of efficiently waiting for these events to occur. This allows it to decide which coroutine to run next, or how to wait before resuming.Such a design implies that there is a set of pre-defined events that the loop understands. Several coroutines await each other, until finally an event is awaited. This event can communicate directly with the event loop by yielding control.The key is that coroutine suspension allows the event loop and events to directly communicate. The intermediate coroutine stack does not require any knowledge about which loop is running it, nor how events work.The simplest event to handle is reaching a point in time. This is a fundamental block of threaded code as well: a thread repeatedly sleeps until a condition is true.

However, a regular sleep blocks execution by itself - we want other coroutines to not be blocked. Instead, we want tell the event loop when it should resume the current coroutine stack.An event is simply a value we can identify - be it via an enum, a type or other identity. We can define this with a simple class that stores our target time. In addition to storing the event information, we can allow to await a class directly.This class only stores the event - it does not say how to actually handle it.The only special feature is __await__ - it is what the await keyword looks for. Practically, it is an iterator but not available for the regular iteration machinery.Now that we have an event, how do coroutines react to it? We should be able to express the equivalent of sleep by awaiting our event. To better see what is going on, we wait twice for half the time:We can directly instantiate and run this coroutine. Similar to a generator, using coroutine.send runs the coroutine until it yields a result.This gives us two AsyncSleep events and then a StopIteration when the coroutine is done. Notice that the only delay is from time.sleep in the loop! Each AsyncSleep only stores an offset from the current time.At this point, we have two separate mechanisms at our disposal:Notably, these two are orthogonal: neither one affects or triggers the other. As a result, we can come up with our own strategy to sleep to meet the delay of an AsyncSleep.If we have several coroutines, each can tell us when it wants to be woken up. We can then wait until the first of them wants to be resumed, then for the one after, and so on. Notably, at each point we only care about which one is next.This makes for a straightforward scheduling:A trivial implementation does not need any advanced concepts. A list allows to sort coroutines by date. Waiting is a regular time.sleep. Running coroutines works just like before with coroutine.send.Of course, this has ample room for improvement. We can use a heap for the wait queue or a dispatch table for events. We could also fetch return values from the StopIteration and assign them to the coroutine. However, the fundamental principle remains the same.The AsyncSleep event and run event loop are a fully working implementation of timed events.This cooperatively switches between each of the five coroutines, suspending each for 0.1 seconds. Even though the event loop is synchronous, it still executes the work in 0.5 seconds instead of 2.5 seconds. Each coroutine holds state and acts independently.An event loop that supports sleep is suitable for polling. However, waiting for I/O on a file handle can be done more efficiently: the operating system implements I/O and thus knows which handles are ready. Ideally, an event loop should support an explicit "ready for I/O" event.Python already has an interface to query the OS for read I/O handles. When called with handles to read or write, it returns the handles ready to read or write:For example, we can open a file for writing and wait for it to be ready:Once select returns, writeable contains our open file.Similar to the AsyncSleep request, we need to define an event for I/O. With the underlying select logic, the event must refer to a readable object - say an open file. In addition, we store how much data to read.As with AsyncSleep we mostly just store the data required for the underlying system call. This time, __await__ is capable of being resumed multiple times - until our desired amount has been read. In addition, we return the I/O result instead of just resuming.The basis for our event loop is still the run defined previously. First, we need to track the read requests. This is no longer a sorted schedule, we only map read requests to coroutines.Since select.select takes a timeout parameter, we can use it in place of time.sleep.This gives us all readable files - if there are any, we run the corresponding coroutine. If there are none, we have waited long enough for our current coroutine to run.Finally, we have to actually listen for read requests.The above was a bit of a simplification. We need to do some switching to not starve sleeping coroutines if we can always read. We need to handle having nothing to read or nothing to wait for. However, the end result still fits into 30 LOC.The AsyncSleep, AsyncRead and run implementations are now fully functional to sleep and/or read.

Same as for sleepy, we can define a helper to test reading:Running this, we can see that our I/O is interleaved with the waiting task:While I/O on files gets the concept across, it is not really suitable for a library like asyncio: the select call always returns for files, and both open and read may block indefinitely. This blocks all coroutines of an event loop - which is bad. Libraries like aiofiles use threads and synchronization to fake non-blocking I/O and events on file.However, sockets do allow for non-blocking I/O - and their inherent latency makes it much more critical. When used in an event loop, waiting for data and retrying can be wrapped without blocking anything.Similar to our AsyncRead, we can define a suspend-and-read event for sockets. Instead of taking a file, we take a socket - which must be non-blocking. Also, our __await__ uses socket.recv instead of file.read.In contrast to AsyncRead, __await__ performs truly non-blocking I/O. When data is available, it always reads. When no data is available, it always suspends. That means the event loop is only blocked while we perform useful work.As far as the event loop is concerned, nothing changes much. The event to listen for is still the same as for files - a file descriptor marked ready by select.At this point, it should be obvious that AsyncRead and AsyncRecv are the same kind of event. We could easily refactor them to be one event with an exchangeable I/O component. In effect, the event loop, coroutines and events cleanly separate a scheduler, arbitrary intermediate code and the actual I/O.In principle, what you should do at this point is replicate the logic of read as a recv for AsyncRecv. However, this is much more ugly now - you have to handle early returns when functions block inside the kernel, but yield control to you. For example, opening a connection versus opening a file is much longer:Long story short, what remains is a few dozen lines of Exception handling. The events and event loop already work at this point.Example code at githubYour coro desugaring is conceptually correct, but slightly incomplete.await doesn't suspend unconditionally, but only if it encounters a blocking call. How does it know that a call is blocking? This is decided by the code being awaited. For example, an awaitable implementation of socket read could be desugared to:In real asyncio the equivalent code modifies the state of a Future instead of returning magic values, but the concept is the same. When appropriately adapted to a generator-like object, the above code can be awaited.On the caller side, when your coroutine contains:It desugars into something close to:People familiar with generators tend to describe the above in terms of yield from which does the suspension automatically.The suspension chain continues all the way up to the event loop, which notices that the coroutine is suspended, removes it from the runnable set, and goes on to execute coroutines that are runnable, if any. If no coroutines are runnable, the loop waits in select() until either a file descriptor a coroutine is interested in becomes ready for IO. (The event loop maintains a file-descriptor-to-coroutine mapping.)In the above example, once select() tells the event loop that sock is readable, it will re-add coro to the runnable set, so it will be continued from the point of suspension.In other words:For insight on coroutine-driving event loops, I recommend this talk by Dave Beazley, where he demonstrates coding an event loop from scratch in front of live audience.It all boils down to the two main challenges that asyncio is addressing:The answer to the first point has been around for a long while and is called a select loop. In python, it is implemented in the selectors module.The second question is related to the concept of coroutine, i.e. functions that can stop their execution and be restored later on. In python, coroutines are implemented using generators and the yield from statement. That's what is hiding behind the async/await syntax.More resources in this answer.EDIT: Addressing your comment about goroutines:The closest equivalent to a goroutine in asyncio is actually not a coroutine but a task (see the difference in the documentation). In python, a coroutine (or a generator) knows nothing about the concepts of event loop or I/O. It simply is a function that can stop  its execution using yield while keeping its current state, so it can be restored later on. The yield from syntax allows for chaining them in a transparent way.Now, within an asyncio task, the coroutine at the very bottom of the chain always ends up yielding a future. This future then bubbles up to the event loop, and gets integrated into the inner machinery. When the future is set to done by some other inner callback, the event loop can restore the task by sending the future back into the coroutine chain.EDIT: Addressing some of the questions in your post:No, nothing happens in a thread. I/O is always managed by the event loop, mostly through file descriptors. However the registration of those file descriptors is usually hidden by high-level coroutines, making the dirty work for you.An I/O is any blocking call. In asyncio, all the I/O operations should go through the event loop, because as you said, the event loop has no way to be aware that a blocking call is being performed in some synchronous code. That means you're not supposed to use a synchronous open within the context of a coroutine. Instead, use a dedicated library such aiofiles which provides an asynchronous version of open.

Just for curiosity I would like to know how to do this in the code below. I have been searching for an answer but is useless.I usually usebefore the call to plt.show(), and I get a maximized window. This works for the 'wx' backend only.EDIT:for Qt4Agg backend, see kwerenda's answer.since I am on zero reputation I can leave no other mark than a new answer

I am on a Windows (WIN7), running Python 2.7.5 & Matplotlib 1.3.1I was able to maximize Figure windows for TkAgg, QT4Agg, and wxAgg using the following lines:Hope this summary of the previous answers (and some additions) combined in a working example (at least for windows) helps.

CheersWith Qt backend (FigureManagerQT) proper command is:This makes the window take up the full screen for me, under Ubuntu 12.04 with the TkAgg backend:For me nothing of the above worked. I use the Tk backend on Ubuntu 14.04 which contains matplotlib 1.3.1.The following code creates a fullscreen plot window which is not the same as maximizing but it serves my purpose nicely:This should work (at least with TkAgg):(adopted from the above and Using Tkinter, is there a way to get the usable screen size without visibly zooming a window?)I get mng.frame.Maximize(True) AttributeError: FigureManagerTkAgg instance has no attribute 'frame' as well.Then I looked through the attributes mng has, and I found this: That worked for me.So for people who have the same trouble, you may try this.By the way, my Matplotlib version is 1.3.1.This is kind of hacky and probably not portable, only use it if you're looking for quick and dirty. If I just set the figure much bigger than the screen, it takes exactly the whole screen.In fact, in Ubuntu 16.04 with Qt4Agg, it maximizes the window (not full-screen) if it's bigger than the screen. (If you have two monitors, it just maximizes it on one of them).I found this for full screen mode on UbuntuMy best effort so far, supporting different backends:Pressing the f key (or ctrl+f in 1.2rc1) when focussed on a plot will fullscreen a plot window. Not quite maximising, but perhaps better.Other than that, to actually maximize, you will need to use GUI Toolkit specific commands (if they exist for your specific backend).HTHTry plt.figure(figsize=(6*3.13,4*3.13)) to make the plot larger.In my versions (Python 3.6, Eclipse, Windows 7), snippets given above didn't work, but with hints given by Eclipse/pydev (after typing: mng.), I found:It seems that using mng-commands is ok only for local development...The one solution that worked on Win 10 flawlessly.Try using 'Figure.set_size_inches' method, with the extra keyword argument forward=True. According to the documentation, this should resize the figure window.Whether that actually happens will depend on the operating system you are using.Ok so this is what worked for me. I did the whole showMaximize() option and it does resize your window in proportion to the size of the figure, but it does not expand and 'fit' the canvas. I solved this by:This doesn't necessarily maximize your window, but it does resize your window in proportion to the size of the figure:This might also help: http://matplotlib.1069221.n5.nabble.com/Resizing-figure-windows-td11424.htmlThe following may work with all the backends, but I tested it only on QT:Here is a function based on @Pythonio's answer. I encapsulate it into a function that automatically detects which backend is it using and do the corresponding actions.

Even better would be to get a tag value of 0 to produce a gray colour and 1-20 be colourful.I have found some 'cookbook' scripts but they are very complicated and I cannot think they are the right way to solve a seemingly simple problemYou can create a custom discrete colorbar quite easily by using a BoundaryNorm as normalizer for your scatter. The quirky bit (in my method) is making 0 showup as grey. For images i often use the cmap.set_bad() and convert my data to a numpy masked array. That would be much easier to make 0 grey, but i couldnt get this to work with the scatter or the custom cmap. As an alternative you can make your own cmap from scratch, or read-out an existing one and override just some specific entries.I personally think that with 20 different colors its a bit hard to read the specific value, but thats up to you of course.You could follow this example:which produces the following image:To set a values above or below the range of the colormap, you'll want to use the set_over and set_under methods of the colormap.  If you want to flag a particular value, mask it (i.e. create a masked array), and use the set_bad method.  (Have a look at the documentation for the base colormap class: http://matplotlib.org/api/colors_api.html#matplotlib.colors.Colormap )It sounds like you want something like this:The above answers are good, except they don't have proper tick placement on the colorbar. I like having the ticks in the middle of the color so that the number -> color mapping is more clear. You can solve this problem by changing the limits of the matshow call:I have been investigating these ideas and here is my five cents worth. It avoids calling BoundaryNorm as well as specifying norm as an argument to scatter and colorbar. However I have found no way of eliminating the rather long-winded call to matplotlib.colors.LinearSegmentedColormap.from_list.Some background is that matplotlib provides so-called qualitative colormaps, intended to use with discrete data. Set1, e.g., has 9 easily distinguishable colors, and tab20 could be used for 20 colors. With these maps it could be natural to use their first n colors to color scatter plots with n categories, as the following example does. The example also produces a colorbar with n discrete colors approprately labelled.which produces the image below. The n in the call to Set1 specifies

the first n colors of that colormap, and the last n in the call to from_list

specifies to construct a map with n colors (the default being 256). In order to set cm as the default colormap with plt.set_cmap, I found it to be necessary to give it a name and register it, viz:I think you'd want to look at colors.ListedColormap to generate your colormap, or if you just need a static colormap I've been working on an app that might help.

Say I wanted to do the following:I'm looking to see if there is something similar to $ in Perl to indicate a variable in the Python syntax.If not - what is the cleanest way to create a multiline string with variables?The common way is the format() function:It works fine with a multi-line format string:You can also pass a dictionary with variables:The closest thing to what you asked (in terms of syntax) are template strings. For example:I should add though that the format() function is more common because it's readily available and it does not require an import line.NOTE: The recommended way to do string formatting in Python is to use format(), as outlined in the accepted answer. I'm preserving this answer as an example of the C-style syntax that's also supported.Some reading:You can use Python 3.6's f-strings for variables inside multi-line or lengthy single-line strings. You can manually specify newline characters using \n.Alternatively, you can also create a multiline f-string with triple quotes.This is what you want:A dictionary can be passed to format(), each key name will become a variable for each associated value.

Also a list can be passed to format(), the index number of each value will be used as variables in this case.

Both solutions above will output the same:

Why is random.shuffle returning None in Python?How do I get the shuffled value instead of None?

2013-07-15 08:33:41Z

Why is random.shuffle returning None in Python?How do I get the shuffled value instead of None?random.shuffle() changes the x list in place.Python API methods that alter a structure in-place generally return None, not the modified data structure.If you wanted to create a new randomly-shuffled list based of an existing one, where the existing list is kept in order, you could use random.sample() with the full length of the input:You could also use sorted() with random.random() for a sorting key:but this invokes sorting (an O(NlogN) operation), while sampling to the input length only takes O(N) operations (the same process as random.shuffle() is used, swapping out random values from a shrinking pool).Demo:This method works too.According to docs:shuffle modifies the list in place.

This is nice, because copying a large list would be pure overhead if you do not need the original list anymore.According to the "explicit is better than implicit" principle of pythonic style, returning the list would be a bad idea, because then one might think it is a new one although in fact it is not.If you do need a fresh list, you will have to write something likewhich is nicely explicit.

If you need this idiom frequently, wrap it in a function shuffled (see sorted) that returns new_x.As pointed out random.shuffle replaces in place, so you wouldn't need a new list variable.Python APIs which change the structure in place itself returns None as output.Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]Output: NoneOutput: [7, 3, 2, 4, 5, 6, 1, 8]I had my aha moment with this concept like this:does not return any values. Instead, that function shuffle the variable itself.So don't tryinstead just print the variable like this.You can return the shuffled list using random.sample() as explained by  others. It works by sampling k elements from the list without replacement.

So if there are duplicate elements in your list, they will be treated uniquely.

I'm porting my Caffe network over to TensorFlow but it doesn't seem to have xavier initialization. I'm using truncated_normal but this seems to be making it a lot harder to train.Since version 0.8 there is a Xavier initializer, see here for the docs.You can use something like this:Just to add another example on how to define a tf.Variable initialized using Xavier and Yoshua's method:This prevented me from having nan values on my loss function due to numerical instabilities when using multiple layers with RELUs.@Aleph7, Xavier/Glorot initialization depends the number of incoming connections (fan_in), number outgoing connections (fan_out), and kind of activation function (sigmoid or tanh) of the neuron. See this: http://jmlr.org/proceedings/papers/v9/glorot10a/glorot10a.pdfSo now, to your question. This is how I would do it in TensorFlow:Note that we should be sampling from a uniform distribution, and not the normal distribution as suggested in the other answer.Incidentally, I wrote a post yesterday for something different using TensorFlow that happens to also use Xavier initialization. If you're interested, there's also a python notebook with an end-to-end example: https://github.com/delip/blog-stuff/blob/master/tensorflow_ufp.ipynb A nice wrapper around tensorflow called prettytensor gives an implementation in the source code (copied directly from here):TF-contrib has xavier_initializer. Here is an example how to use it:In addition to this, tensorflow has other initializers:In Tensorflow 2.0 and further both tf.contrib.* and tf.get_variable() are deprecated. In order to do Xavier initialization you now have to switch to:Glorot uniform and Xavier uniform are two different names of the same initialization type. If you want to know more about how to use initializations in TF2.0 with or without Keras refer to documentation.I looked and I couldn't find anything built in. However, according to this:http://andyljones.tumblr.com/post/110998971763/an-explanation-of-xavier-initializationXavier initialization is just sampling a (usually Gaussian) distribution where the variance is a function of the number of neurons.  tf.random_normal can do that for you, you just need to compute the stddev (i.e. the number of neurons being represented by the weight matrix you're trying to initialize).Via the kernel_initializer parameter to tf.layers.conv2d, tf.layers.conv2d_transpose, tf.layers.Dense  etce.g.https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/layers/conv2dhttps://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/layers/conv2d_transposehttps://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/layers/DenseJust in case you want to use one line as you do with:You can do:

Unfortunately, the graphs appear one above the other, rather than side-by-side, which you did request in your original question. But it is very concise.If the dataframe has more than the two series, and you only want to plot those two, you'll need to replace df with df[['korisnika','osiguranika']].Something like this:Note that this will also work if you are using the seaborn package for plotting:I don't know if this is new functionality, but this will plot on separate figures:while this will plot on the same figure: (just like the code in the op)I found this question because I was using the former method and wanted them to plot on the same figure, so your question was actually my answer.

I have a ~10M record MySQL table that I interface with using SqlAlchemy.

The rationale here regards queries that are more than simple SELECT statements. For example, in joins to other tables that may return the same object identity multiple times in one result set (common with eager loading), the full set of rows needs to be in memory so that the correct results can be returned otherwise collections and such might be only partially populated.So Query offers an option to change this behavior through yield_per().  This call will cause the Query to yield rows in batches, where you give it the batch size.  As the docs state, this is only appropriate if you aren't doing any kind of eager loading of collections so it's basically if you really know what you're doing.   Also, if the underlying DBAPI pre-buffers rows, there will still be that memory overhead so the approach only scales slightly better than not using it.I hardly ever use yield_per(); instead, I use a better version of the LIMIT approach you suggest above using window functions.   LIMIT and OFFSET have a huge problem that very large OFFSET values cause the query to get slower and slower, as an OFFSET of N causes it to page through N rows - it's like doing the same query fifty times instead of one, each time reading a larger and larger number of rows.   With a window-function approach, I pre-fetch a set of "window" values that refer to chunks of the table I want to select.  I then emit individual SELECT statements that each pull from one of those windows at a time.The window function approach is on the wiki and I use it with great success.Also note: not all databases support window functions; you need Postgresql, Oracle, or SQL Server.  IMHO using at least Postgresql is definitely worth it - if you're using a relational database, you might as well use the best.I am not a database expert, but when using SQLAlchemy as a simple Python abstraction layer (ie, not using the ORM Query object) I've came up with a satisfying solution to query a 300M-row table without exploding memory usage...Here is a dummy example:Then, I use the SQLAlchemy fetchmany() method to iterate  over the results in a infinite while loop:This method allowed me to do all kind of data aggregation without any dangerous memory overhead. NOTE the stream_results works with Postgres and the pyscopg2 adapter, but I guess it won't work with any DBAPI, nor with any database driver...There is an interesting usecase in this blog post that inspired my above method.I've been looking into efficient traversal/paging with SQLAlchemy and would like to update this answer.I think you can use the slice call to properly limit the scope of a query and you could efficiently reuse it.Example:In the spirit of Joel's answer, I use the following:Using LIMIT/OFFSET is bad, because you need to find all {OFFSET} columns before, so the larger is OFFSET - the longer request you get.

Using windowed query for me also gives bad results on large table with large amount of data (you wait first results for too long, that it's not good in my case for chunked web response).Best approach given here https://stackoverflow.com/a/27169302/450103. In my case I resolved problem simply using index on datetime field and fetching next query with datetime>=previous_datetime. Stupid, because I used that index in different cases before, but thought that for fetching all data windowed query would be better. In my case I was wrong.AFAIK, the first variant still gets all the tuples from the table (with one SQL query) but builds the ORM presentation for each entity when iterating. So it is more efficient than building a list of all entities before iterating but you still have to fetch all the (raw) data into memory.Thus, using LIMIT on huge tables sounds like a good idea to me.

How do I do it?I am trying to do the following:Thanks in advanceCookie is just another HTTP header.See urllib2 examples for other ways how to add HTTP headers to your request.There are more ways how to handle cookies. Some modules like cookielib try to behave like web browser - remember what cookies did you get previously and automatically send them again in following requests.Maybe using cookielib.CookieJar can help you. For instance when posting to a page containing a form:EDIT:After Piotr's comment I'll elaborate a bit. From the docs:So whatever requests you make with your CookieJar instance, all cookies will be handled automagically. Kinda like your browser does :)I can only speak from my own experience and my 99% use-case for cookies is to receive a cookie and then need to send it with all subsequent requests in that session.

The code above handles just that, and it does so transparently.You might want to take a look at the excellent HTTP Python library called Requests. It makes every task involving HTTP a bit easier than urllib2. From Cookies section of quickstart guide:Use cookielib. The linked doc page provides examples at the end. You'll also find a tutorial here.This answer is not working since the urllib2 module has been split across several modules in Python 3.

This is what VOC does. VOC is a transpiler - it takes Python source code, compiles it to CPython Bytecode, and then transpiles that bytecode into Java-compatible bytecode. The end result is that your Python source code files are compiled directly to a Java .class file, which can be packaged into an Android application.VOC also allows you to access native Java objects as if they were Python objects, implement Java interfaces with Python classes, and subclass Java classes with Python classes. Using this, you can write an Android application directly against the native Android APIs.Once you've written your native Android application, you can use Briefcase to package your Python code as an Android application. Briefcase is a tool for converting a Python project into a standalone native application. You can package projects for:You can check This native Android Tic Tac Toe app written in Python, using the BeeWare suite. on GitHubin addition to the BeeWare tools, you'll need to have a JDK and Android SDK installed to test run your application.and to answer your second question: a good environment can be anything you are comfortable with be it a text editor and a command line, or an IDE, if you're looking for a good python IDE I would suggest you try Pycharm, it has  a community edition which is free, and it has a similar environment as android studio, due to to the fact that were made by the same company.I hope this has been helpfulYou could try BeeWare - as described on their website:Gives you want you want now to write Android Apps in Python, plus has the advantage that you won't need to learn yet another framework in future if you end up also wanting to do something on one of the other listed platforms.Here's the Tutorial for Android Apps.There are two primary contenders for python apps on Androidhttps://chaquo.com/chaquopy/This integrates with the Android build system, it provides a Python API for all android features. To quote the site "The complete Android API and user interface toolkit are directly at your disposal."https://pybee.org/This provides a multi target transpiler, supports many targets such as Android and iOS. It uses a generic widget toolkit (toga) that maps to the host interface calls. Both are active projects and their github accounts shows a fair amount of recent activity. Beeware Toga like all widget libraries is good for getting the basics out to multiple platforms. If you have basic designs, and a desire to expand to other platforms this should work out well for you.On the other hand, Chaquopy is a much more precise in its mapping of the python API to Android. It also allows you to mix in Java, useful if you want to use existing code from other resources. If you have strict design targets, and predominantly want to target Android this is a much better resource.Android, Python !When I saw these two keywords together in your question, Kivy is the one which came to my mind first.Before coming to native Android development in Java using Android Studio, I had tried Kivy. It just awesome. Here are a few advantage I could find out.

Simple to useWith a python basics, you won't have trouble learning it.

Good communityIt's well documented and has a great, active community.

Cross platform.You can develop thing for Android, iOS, Windows, Linux and even Raspberry Pi with this single framework.

Open source.

It is a free softwareAt least few of it's (Cross platform) competitors want you to pay a fee if you want a commercial license.

Accelerated graphics supportKivy's graphics engine build over OpenGL ES 2 makes it suitable for softwares which require fast graphics rendering such as games.

Now coming into the next part of question, you can't use Android Studio IDE for Kivy. Here is a detailed guide for setting up the development environment.

Then you can do the following:A simple example of my usual implementation of a copy constructor:For your situation, I would suggest writing a class method (or it could be a static method or a separate function) that takes as an argument an instance of the library's class and returns an instance of your class with all applicable attributes copied over.Building on @Godsmith's train of thought and addressing @Zitrax's need (I think) to do the data copy for all attributes within the constructor:This ConfusionMatrix class inherits a pandas.DataFrame and adds a ton of other attributes and methods that need to be recomputed unless the other matrix data can be copied over.

Help please?Try using multiprocessing.Manager to manage your queue and to also make it accessible to different workers.multiprocessing.Pool already has a shared result-queue, there is no need to additionally involve a Manager.Queue. Manager.Queue is a queue.Queue (multithreading-queue) under the hood, located on a separate server-process and exposed via proxies. This adds additional overhead compared to Pool's internal queue. Contrary to relying on Pool's native result-handling, the results in the Manager.Queue also are not guaranteed to be ordered.The worker processes are not started with .apply_async(), this already happens when you instantiate Pool. What is started

when you call pool.apply_async() is a new "job". Pool's worker-processes run the multiprocessing.pool.worker-function under the hood. This function takes care of processing new "tasks" transferred over Pool's internal Pool._inqueue and of sending results back to the parent over the Pool._outqueue. Your specified func will be executed within multiprocessing.pool.worker. func only has to return something and the result will be automatically send back to the parent..apply_async() immediately (asynchronously) returns a AsyncResult object (alias for ApplyResult). You need to call .get() (is blocking) on that object to receive the actual result. Another option would be to register a callback function, which gets fired as soon as the result becomes ready.Example Output:Note: Specifying the timeout-parameter for .get() will not stop the actual processing of the task within the worker, it only unblocks the waiting parent by raising a multiprocessing.TimeoutError.

The only thing which could be spoiled by reloading model is your optimizer state. To check that - try to save and reload model and train it on training data.The problem might be that you use a different optimizer - or different arguments to your optimizer. I just had the same issue with a custom pretrained model, using for the pretrained model, whereby the original learning rate starts at 0.0003 and during pre-training it is reduced to the min_learning rate, which is 0.000003I just copied that line over to the script which uses the pre-trained model and got really bad accuracies. Until I noticed that the last learning rate of the pretrained model was the min learning rate, i.e. 0.000003. And if I start with that learning rate, I get exactly the same accuracies to start with as the output of the pretrained model - which makes sense, as starting with a learning rate that is 100 times bigger than the last learning rate used in the pretrained model will result in a huge overshoot of GD and hence in heavily decreased accuracies. Notice that Keras sometimes has issues with loaded models, as in here.

This might explain cases in which you don't start from the same trained accuracy.All above helps, you must resume from same learning rate() as the LR when the model and weights were saved. Set it directly on the optimizer. Note that improvement from there is not guaranteed, because the model may have reached the local minimum, which may be global. There is no point to resume a model in order to search for another local minimum, unless you intent to increase the learning rate in a controlled fashion and nudge the model into a possibly better minimum not far away.You might also be hitting Concept Drift, see Should you retrain a model when new observations are available. There's also the concept of catastrophic forgetting which a bunch of academic papers discuss.  Here's one with MNIST Empirical investigation of catastrophic forgetting

Suppose you have the following situationAs you can see, makeSpeak is a routine that accepts a generic Animal object. In this case, Animal is quite similar to a Java interface, as it contains only a pure virtual method. makeSpeak does not know the nature of the Animal it gets passed. It just sends it the signal「speak」and leaves the late binding to take care of which method to call: either Cat::speak() or Dog::speak(). This means that, as far as makeSpeak is concerned, the knowledge of which subclass is actually passed is irrelevant.But what about Python? Let’s see the code for the same case in Python. Please note that I try to be as similar as possible to the C++ case for a moment:Now, in this example you see the same strategy. You use inheritance to leverage the hierarchical concept of both Dogs and Cats being Animals. 

But in Python, there’s no need for this hierarchy. This works equally wellIn Python you can send the signal「speak」to any object you want. If the object is able to deal with it, it will be executed, otherwise it will raise an exception. Suppose you add a class Airplane to both codes, and submit an Airplane object to makeSpeak. In the C++ case, it won’t compile, as Airplane is not a derived class of Animal. In the Python case, it will raise an exception at runtime, which could even be an expected behavior.On the other side, suppose you add a MouthOfTruth class with a method speak(). In the C++ case, either you will have to refactor your hierarchy, or you will have to define a different makeSpeak method to accept MouthOfTruth objects, or in java you could extract the behavior into a CanSpeakIface and implement the interface for each. There are many solutions...What I’d like to point out is that I haven’t found a single reason yet to use inheritance in Python (apart of frameworks and trees of exceptions, but I guess that alternative strategies exist). you don’t need to implement a base-derived hierarchy to perform polymorphically. If you want to use inheritance to reuse implementation, you can accomplish the same through containment and delegation, with the added benefit that you can alter it at runtime, and you clearly define the interface of the contained, without risking unintended side effects.So, in the end, the question stands: what's the point of inheritance in Python?Edit: thanks for the very interesting answers. Indeed you can use it for code reuse, but I am always careful when reusing implementation. In general, I tend to do very shallow inheritance trees or no tree at all, and if a functionality is common I refactor it out as a common module routine and then call it from each object. I do see the advantage of having one single point of change (eg. instead of adding to Dog, Cat, Moose and so on, I just add to Animal, which is the basic advantage of inheritance), but you can achieve the same with a delegation chain (eg. a la JavaScript). I'm not claiming it's better though, just another way.I also found a similar post on this regard.

Suppose you have the following situationAs you can see, makeSpeak is a routine that accepts a generic Animal object. In this case, Animal is quite similar to a Java interface, as it contains only a pure virtual method. makeSpeak does not know the nature of the Animal it gets passed. It just sends it the signal「speak」and leaves the late binding to take care of which method to call: either Cat::speak() or Dog::speak(). This means that, as far as makeSpeak is concerned, the knowledge of which subclass is actually passed is irrelevant.But what about Python? Let’s see the code for the same case in Python. Please note that I try to be as similar as possible to the C++ case for a moment:Now, in this example you see the same strategy. You use inheritance to leverage the hierarchical concept of both Dogs and Cats being Animals.

I'm not claiming it's better though, just another way.I also found a similar post on this regard.You are referring to the run-time duck-typing as "overriding" inheritance, however I believe inheritance has its own merits as a design and implementation approach, being an integral part of object oriented design. In my humble opinion, the question of whether you can achieve something otherwise is not very relevant, because actually you could code Python without classes, functions and more, but the question is how well-designed, robust and readable your code will be.I can give two examples for where inheritance is the right approach in my opinion, I'm sure there are more. First, if you code wisely, your makeSpeak function may want to validate that its input is indeed an Animal, and not only that "it can speak", in which case the most elegant method would be to use inheritance. Again, you can do it in other ways, but that's the beauty of object oriented design with inheritance - your code will "really" check whether the input is an "animal".Second, and clearly more straightforward, is Encapsulation - another integral part of object oriented design. This becomes relevant when the ancestor has data members and/or non-abstract methods. Take the following silly example, in which the ancestor has a function (speak_twice) that invokes a then-abstract function:Assuming "speak_twice" is an important feature, you don't want to code it in both Dog and Cat, and I'm sure you can extrapolate this example. Sure, you could implement a Python stand-alone function that will accept some duck-typed object, check whether it has a speak function and invoke it twice, but that's both non-elegant and misses point number 1 (validate it's an Animal). Even worse, and to strengthen the Encapsulation example, what if a member function in the descendant class wanted to use "speak_twice"?It gets even clearer if the ancestor class has a data member, for example "number_of_legs" that is used by non-abstract methods in the ancestor like "print_number_of_legs", but is initiated in the descendant class' constructor (e.g. Dog would initialize it with 4 whereas Snake would initialize it with 0). Again, I'm sure there are endless more examples, but basically every (large enough) software that is based on solid object oriented design will require inheritance.Inheritance in Python is all about code reuse.  Factorize common functionality into a base class, and implement different functionality in the derived classes.Inheritance in Python is more of a convenience than anything else.  I find that it's best used to provide a class with "default behavior."Indeed, there is a significant community of Python devs who argue against using inheritance at all.  Whatever you do, don't just don't overdo it.  Having an overly complicated class hierarchy is a sure way to get labeled a "Java programmer", and you just can't have that.  :-)I think the point of inheritance in Python is not to make the code compile, it is for the real reason of inheritance which is extending the class into another child class, and to override the logic in the base class. However the duck typing in Python makes the "interface" concept useless, because you can just check if the method exist before invokation with no need to use an interface to limit the class structure.I think that it is very difficult to give a meaningful, concrete answer with such abstract examples...To simplify, there are two types of inheritance: interface and implementation. If you need to inherit the implementation, then python is not so different than statically typed OO languages like C++. Inheritance of interface is where there is a big difference, with fundamental consequences for the design of your software in my experience. Languages like Python does not force you to use inheritance in that case, and avoiding inheritance is a good point in most cases, because it is very hard to fix a wrong design choice there later. That's a well known point raised in any good OOP book.There are cases where using inheritance for interfaces is advisable in Python, for example for plug-ins, etc... For those cases, Python 2.5 and below lacks a "built-in" elegant approach, and several big frameworks designed their own solutions (zope, trac, twister). Python 2.6 and above has ABC classes to solve this.It's not inheritance that duck-typing makes pointless, it's interfaces — like the one you chose in creating an all abstract animal class.If you had used an animal class that introduce some real behavior for its descendants to make use of, then dog and cat classes that introduced some additional behavior there would be a reason for both classes.  It's only in the case of the ancestor class contributing no actual code to the descendant classes that your argument is correct.Because Python can directly know the capabilities of any object, and because those capabilities are mutable beyond the class definition, the idea of using a pure abstract interface to "tell" the program what methods can be called is somewhat pointless.  But that's not the sole, or even the main, point of inheritance.In C++/Java/etc, polymorphism is caused by inheritance. Abandon that misbegotten belief, and dynamic languages open up to you.Essentially, in Python there is no interface so much as "the understanding that certain methods are callable".  Pretty hand-wavy and academic-sounding, no? It means that because you call "speak" you clearly expect that the object should have a "speak" method.  Simple, huh?  This is very Liskov-ian in that the users of a class define its interface, a good design concept that leads you into healthier TDD.So what is left is, as another poster politely managed to avoid saying, a code sharing trick.  You could write the same behavior into each "child" class, but that would be redundant.  Easier to inherit or mix-in functionality that is invariant across the inheritance hierarchy.  Smaller, DRY-er code is better in general.  You can get around inheritance in Python and pretty much any other language.  It's all about code reuse and code simplification though.  Just a semantic trick, but after building your classes and base classes, you don't even have to know what's possible with your object to see if you can do it.  Say you have d which is a Dog that subclassed Animal.If whatever the user typed in is available, the code will run the proper method.  Using this you can create whatever combination of Mammal/Reptile/Bird hybrid monstrosity you want, and now you can make it say 'Bark!' while flying and sticking out its forked tongue and it will handle it properly!  Have fun with it!I don't see much point in inheritance.Every time I have ever used inheritance in real systems, I got burned because it led to a tangled web of dependencies, or I simply realised in time that I would be a lot better off without it. Now, I avoid it as much as possible. I simply never have a use for it.James Gosling was once asked at a press conference a question along the lines: "If you could go back and do Java differently, what would you leave out?". His response was "Classes", to which there was laughter. However, he was serious and explained that really, it was not classes that were the problem but inheritance.I kind of view it like a drug dependency - it gives you a quick fix that feels good, but in the end, it messes you up. By that I mean that it is a convenient way to reuse code, but it forces an unhealthy coupling between child and parent class. Changes to the parent may break the child. The child is dependant on the parent for certain functionality and cannot alter that functionality. Therefore the functionality provided by the child is also tied to the parent - you can only have both.Better is to provide one single client facing class for an interface which implements the interface, using the functionality of other objects which are composed at construction time. Doing this via properly designed interfaces, all coupling can be eliminated and we provide a highly composable API (This is nothing new - most programmers already do this, just not enough). Note that the implementing class must not simply expose functionality, otherwise the client should just use the composed classes directly - it must do something new by combining that functionality.There is the argument from the inheritance camp that pure delegation implementations suffer because they require lots of 'glue' methods which simply pass along values through a delegation 'chain'. However, this is simply reinventing an inheritance-like design using delegation. Programmers with too many years of exposure to inheritance-based designs are particularly vulnerable to falling into this trap, as, without realising it, they will think of how they would implement something using inheritance and then convert that to delegation.Proper separation of concerns like the above code doesn't require glue methods, as each step is actually adding value, so they are not really 'glue' methods at all (if they don't add value, the design is flawed).It boils down to this:Another small point is that op's 3'rd example, you can't call isinstance(). For example passing your 3'rd example to another object that takes and "Animal" type an calls speak on it. If you do it don't you would have to check for dog type, cat type, and so on. Not sure if instance checking is really "Pythonic", because of late binding. But then you would have to implement some way that the AnimalControl doesn't try to throw Cheeseburger types in the truck, becuase Cheeseburgers don't speak.Classes in Python are basically just ways of grouping a bunch of functions and data.. They are different to classes in C++ and such..I've mostly seen inheritance used for overriding methods of the super-class. For example, perhaps a more Python'ish use of inheritance would be..Of course cats aren't a type of dog, but I have this (third party) Dog class which works perfectly, except the speak method which I want to override - this saves re-implementing  the entire class, just so it meows. Again, while Cat isn't a type of Dog, but a cat does inherit a lot of attributes..A much better (practical) example of overriding a method or attribute is how you change the user-agent for urllib. You basically subclass urllib.FancyURLopener and change the version attribute (from the documentation):Another manner exceptions are used is for Exceptions, when inheritance is used in a more "proper" way:..you can then catch AnimalError to catch all exceptions which inherit from it, or a specific one like  AnimalBrokenLegError

Ok, Tornado is non-blocking and quite fast and it can handle a lot of standing requests easily.But I guess it's not a silver bullet and if we just blindly run Django-based or any other site with Tornado it won't give any performance boost.I couldn't find comprehensive explanation of this, so I'm asking it here:This distinction is a bit blurry. Only if you are serving static pages, you would use one of the fast server like lighthttpd. Other wise, most servers provides a varying complexity of framework to develop web applications. Tornado is a good web framework. Twisted is even more capable and is considered a good networking framework. It has support for lot of protocols. Tornado and Twisted are frameworks that provide support non-blocking, asynchronous web / networking application development. By it's very nature, Async / Non-Blocking I/O works great when it is I/O intensive and not computation intensive. Most web / networking applications suits well for this model. If your application demands certain computational intensive task to be done then it has to be delegated to some other service that can handle it better. While Tornado / Twisted can do the job of web server, responding to web requests.Performance is usually a characteristic of complete web application architecture. You can bring down the performance with most web frameworks, if the application is not designed properly. Think about caching, load balancing etc. Tornado and Twisted provides reasonable performance and is good for building a very performant web application. You can check out the testimonials for both twisted and tornado to see what they are capable of. I'm sorry for answering an old question, but I came across this one and wondered why it didn't have more answers. To answer Bart J's question:Well that depends on what kind of parsing you're doing and on what hardware :) Long time is a long time, so if your app takes more than say half a second to respond, it'll seem sluggish -  profile your app.The key to fast systems is great architecture, not so much the specifics as for instance which framework you're using (Twisted, Tornado, Apache+PHP). Tornado has an asynchronous processing style and that's really what a lot of it comes down to in my opinion. Node.js, Twisted and Yaws are examples of other asynchronous web servers that scale very well because of a lightweight approach and asynchronous processing style.So:Tornado is good for handling a lot of connections, since it can respond to an incoming client, dispatch a request handler and don't think about that client until the result-callback is pushed on the event queue. So for that specific quality Tornado should be used when you want to scale well when handling a lot of requests. 

The async processing facilitates functional decoupling and shared-nothing data access. That swings really well with stateless design like REST or other Service Oriented Architectures. You also don't have to deal with spawning threads or processes with the inherent overhead so much and you can save some of the locking/IPC trouble.Tornado won't make much of a difference, on the other hand, if your backend and/or data store takes a long time to process the requests. It helps to do concurrent designs and Web services in particular. The concurrent architecture makes it easier to scale your design and keep the coupling low. That's my experience with Tornado at least.

I am totally new to python and I am trying to implement quicksort in it.

Could someone please help me complete my code?I do not know how to concatenate the three arrays and printing them. Quick sort without additional memory (in place)Usage:

There is another concise and beautiful versionLet me explain the above codes for detailsIf I search "python quicksort implementation" in Google, this question is the first result to pop up. I understand that the initial question was to "help correct the code" but there already are many answers that disregard that request: the currently second most voted one, the horrendous one-liner with the hilarious "You are fired" comment and, in general, many implementations that are not in-place (i.e. use extra memory proportional to input list size). This answer provides an in-place solution but it is for python 2.x. So, below follows my interpretation of the in-place solution from Rosetta Code which will work just fine for python 3 too:And if you are willing to forgo the in-place property, below is yet another version which better illustrates the basic ideas behind quicksort. Apart from readability, its other advantage is that it is stable (equal elements appear in the sorted list in the same order that they used to have in the unsorted list). This stability property does not hold with the less memory-hungry in-place implementation presented above.In real life, we should always use the builtin sort provided by Python. However, understanding the quicksort algorithm is instructive. My goal here is to break down the subject such that it is easily understood and replicable by the reader without having to return to reference materials.The quicksort algorithm is essentially the following:If the data are randomly distributed, selecting the first data point as the pivot is equivalent to a random selection.First, let's look at a readable example that uses comments and variable names to point to intermediate values:To restate the algorithm and code demonstrated here - we move values above the pivot to the right, and values below the pivot to the left, and then pass those partitions to same function to be further sorted.This can be golfed to 88 characters:To see how we get there, first take our readable example, remove comments and docstrings, and find the pivot in-place:Now find below and above, in-place:Now, knowing that and returns the prior element if false, else if it is true, it evaluates and returns the following element, we have:Since lambdas return a single epression, and we have simplified to a single expression (even though it is getting more unreadable) we can now use a lambda:And to reduce to our example, shorten the function and variable names to one letter, and eliminate the whitespace that isn't required.Note that this lambda, like most code golfing, is rather bad style.The prior implementation creates a lot of unnecessary extra lists. If we can do this in-place, we'll avoid wasting space.The below implementation uses the Hoare partitioning scheme, which you can read more about on wikipedia (but we have apparently removed up to 4 redundant calculations per partition() call by using while-loop semantics instead of do-while and moving the narrowing steps to the end of the outer while loop.).Not sure if I tested it thoroughly enough:This algorithm is frequently taught in computer science courses and asked for on job interviews. It helps us think about recursion and divide-and-conquer. Quicksort is not very practical in Python since our builtin timsort algorithm is quite efficient, and we have recursion limits. We would expect to sort lists in-place with list.sort or create new sorted lists with sorted - both of which take a key and reverse argument. There are many answers to this already, but I think this approach is the most clean implementation:You can of course skip storing everything in variables and return them straight away like this:functional approach:functional programming aproachI think both answers here works ok for the list provided (which answer the original question), but would breaks if an array containing non unique values is passed. So for completeness, I would just point out the small error in each and explain how to fix them.For example trying to sort the following array  [12,4,5,6,7,3,1,15,1] (Note that 1 appears twice) with Brionius algorithm .. at some point will end up with the less array empty and the equal array with a pair of values (1,1) that can not be separated in the next iteration and the len() > 1...hence you'll end up with an infinite loopYou can fix it by either returning array if less is empty or better by not calling sort in your equal array, as in zangw answer The fancier solution also breaks, but for a different cause, it is missing the return clause in the recursion line, which will cause at some point to return None and try to append it to a list ....To fix it just add a return to that linePartition - Split an array by a pivot that smaller elements move to the left and greater elemets move to the right or vice versa. A pivot can be an random element from an array. To make this algorith we need to know what is begin and end index of an array and where is a pivot. Then set two auxiliary pointers L, R.So we have an array user[...,begin,...,end,...]The start position of L and R pointers

[...,begin,next,...,end,...]

     R       Lwhile L < end

  1. If a user[pivot] > user[L] then move R by one and swap user[R] with user[L]

  2. move L by oneAfter while swap user[R] with user[pivot]Quick sort - Use the partition algorithm until every next part of the split by a pivot will have begin index greater or equals than end index.Easy implementation from grokking algorithmsThis is a version of the quicksort using Hoare partition scheme and with fewer swaps and local variablesI know many people have answered this question correctly and I enjoyed reading them. My answer is almost the same as zangw but I think the previous contributors did not do a good job of explaining visually how things actually work...so here is my attempt to help others that might visit this question/answers in the future about a simple solution for quicksort implementation.How does it work ?Here is an example along with visual to go with it ...

(pivot)9,11,2,0average: n log of n worse case: n^2 The code:items=[9,11,2,0]

print(quicksort(items))Or if you prefer a one-liner that also illustrates the Python equivalent of C/C++ varags, lambda expressions, and if expressions:A "true" in-place implementation [Algorithms 8.9, 8.11 from the Algorithm Design and Applications Book by Michael T. Goodrich and Roberto Tamassia]:The algorithm has 4 simple steps:Code for the algorithm in python:Carry on with this algorithm recursively with the left and right parts.Another quicksort implementation:For Version Python 3.x: a functional-style using operator module, primarily to improve readability. and is tested as        Here's an easy implementation:-The algorithm contains two boundaries, one having elements less than the pivot  (tracked by index "j") and the other having elements greater than the pivot (tracked by index "i"). In each iteration, a new element is processed by incrementing j.Invariant:- If the invariant is violated, ith and jth elements are swapped, and i 

is incremented. After all elements have been processed, and everything after the pivot 

has been partitioned, the pivot element is swapped with the last element 

smaller than it.The pivot element will now be in its correct place in the sequence. The 

elements before it will be less than it and the ones after it will be 

greater than it, and they will be unsorted.A "good" pivot will result in two sub-sequences of roughly the same 

size. Deterministically, a pivot element can either be selected in a 

naive manner or by computing the median of the sequence.A naive implementation of selecting a pivot will be the first or last 

element. The worst-case runtime in this case will be when the input 

sequence is already sorted or reverse sorted, as one of the subsequences 

will be empty which will cause only one element to be removed per 

recursive call.A perfectly balanced split is achieved when the pivot is the median

element of the sequence. There are an equal number of elements greater 

than it and less than it. This approach guarantees a better overall 

running time, but is much more time-consuming.A non-deterministic/random way of selecting the pivot would be to pick 

an element uniformly at random. This is a simple and lightweight 

approach that will minimize worst-case scenario and also lead to a 

roughly balanced split. This will also provide a balance between the naive approach and the median approach of selecting the pivot.I am attaching the code below! This quicksort is a great learning tool because of the Location of the pivot value. Since it is in a constant place, you can walk through it multiple times and really get a hang of how it all works. In practice it is best to randomize the pivot to avoid O(N^2) runtime.Full example with printed variables at partition step:This algorithm doesn't use recursive functions.Let N be any list of numbers with len(N) > 0. Set K = [N] and execute the following program.Note: This is a stable sorting algorithm.inlace sortwithout recursion:

I have a sorted list, let say: (its not really just numbers, its a list of objects that are sorted with a complicated time consuming algorithm)Is there some python function that will give me N of the items, but will keep the order?Example:etc...Following code will generate a random sample of size 4:(note: with Python 2, better use xrange instead of range)Explanationgenerates a random sample of the indices of the original list.These indices then get sorted to preserve the ordering of elements in the original list.Finally, the list comprehension pulls out the actual elements from the original list, given the sampled indices.Take a random sample without replacement of the indices, sort the indices, and take them from the original.Or more concisely:You can alternatively use a math trick and iteratively go through myList from left to right, picking numbers with dynamically-changing probability (N-numbersPicked)/(total-numbersVisited). The advantage of this approach is that it's an O(N) algorithm since it doesn't involve sorting!Proof of concept and test that probabilities are correct:Simulated with 1 trillion pseudorandom samples over the course of 5 hours:Probabilities diverge from true probabilities by less a factor of 1.0001. Running this test again resulted in a different order meaning it isn't biased towards one ordering. Running the test with fewer samples for [0,1,2,3,4], k=3 and [0,1,2,3,4,5], k=4 had similar results.edit: Not sure why people are voting up wrong comments or afraid to upvote... NO, there is nothing wrong with this method. =)(Also a useful note from user tegan in the comments: If this is python2, you will want to use xrange, as usual, if you really care about extra space.)edit: Proof: Considering the uniform distribution (without replacement) of picking a subset of k out of a population seq of size len(seq), we can consider a partition at an arbitrary point i into 'left' (0,1,...,i-1) and 'right' (i,i+1,...,len(seq)). Given that we picked numbersPicked from the left known subset, the remaining must come from the same uniform distribution on the right unknown subset, though the parameters are now different. In particular, the probability that seq[i] contains a chosen element is #remainingToChoose/#remainingToChooseFrom, or (k-numbersPicked)/(len(seq)-i), so we simulate that and recurse on the result. (This must terminate since if #remainingToChoose == #remainingToChooseFrom, then all remaining probabilities are 1.) This is similar to a probability tree that happens to be dynamically generated. Basically you can simulate a uniform probability distribution by conditioning on prior choices (as you grow the probability tree, you pick the probability of the current branch such that it is aposteriori the same as prior leaves, i.e. conditioned on prior choices; this will work because this probability is uniformly exactly N/k).edit: Timothy Shields mentions Reservoir Sampling, which is the generalization of this method when len(seq) is unknown (such as with a generator expression). Specifically the one noted as "algorithm R" is O(N) and O(1) space if done in-place; it involves taking the first N element and slowly replacing them (a hint at an inductive proof is also given). There are also useful distributed variants and miscellaneous variants of reservoir sampling to be found on the wikipedia page.edit: Here's another way to code it below in a more semantically obvious manner.)Maybe you can just generate the sample of indices and then collect the items from your list.Apparently random.sample was introduced in python 2.3so for version under that, we can use shuffle (example for 4 items):random.sample implement it.

Is it possible to add a documentation string to a namedtuple in an easy manner?I triedbut that doesn't cut it. Is it possible to do in some other way?You can achieve this by creating a simple, empty wrapper class around the returned value from namedtuple.  Contents of a file I created (nt.py):Then in the Python REPL:Or you could do:If you don't like doing that by hand every time, it's trivial to write a sort-of factory function to do this:which outputs:In Python 3, no wrapper is needed, as the __doc__ attributes of types is writable.This closely corresponds to a standard class definition, where the docstring follows the header.This does not work in Python 2.AttributeError: attribute '__doc__' of 'type' objects is not writable. Came across this old question via Google while wondering the same thing.Just wanted to point out that you can tidy it up even more by calling namedtuple() right from the class declaration:Yes, in several ways.As of Python 3.6 we can use a class definition with typing.NamedTuple directly, with a docstring (and annotations!):Compared to Python 2, declaring empty __slots__ is not necessary. In Python 3.8, it isn't necessary even for subclasses.Note that declaring __slots__ cannot be non-empty!In Python 3, you can also easily alter the doc on a namedtuple:Which allows us to view the intent for them when we call help on them:This is really straightforward compared to the difficulties we have accomplishing the same thing in Python 2.In Python 2, you'll need toDeclaring __slots__ is an important part that the other answers here miss . If you don't declare __slots__ - you could add mutable ad-hoc attributes to the instances, introducing bugs.And now:Each instance will create a separate __dict__ when __dict__ is accessed (the lack of __slots__ won't otherwise impede the functionality, but the lightweightness of the tuple, immutability, and declared attributes are all important features of namedtuples). You'll also want a __repr__, if you want what is echoed on the command line to give you an equivalent object:a __repr__ like this is needed if you create the base namedtuple with a different name (like we did above with the name string argument, 'NTBase'):To test the repr, instantiate, then test for equality of a pass to eval(repr(instance))The docs also give such an example, regarding __slots__ - I'm adding my own docstring to it:This demonstrates in-place usage (like another answer here suggests), but note that the in-place usage may become confusing when you look at the method resolution order, if you're debugging, which is why I originally suggested using Base as a suffix for the base namedtuple:To prevent creation of a __dict__ when subclassing from a class that uses it, you must also declare it in the subclass. See also this answer for more caveats on using __slots__.Since Python 3.5, docstrings for namedtuple objects can be updated.From the whatsnew:In Python 3.6+ you can use:No need to use a wrapper class as suggested by the accepted answer. Simply literally add a docstring:This results in: (example using ipython3):Voilà!You could concoct your own version of the namedtuple factory function by Raymond Hettinger and add an optional docstring argument.  However it would be easier -- and arguably better -- to just define your own factory function using the same basic technique as in the recipe.  Either way, you'll end up with something reusable.I created this function to quickly create a named tuple and document the tuple along with each of its parameters:You can then create a new named tuple:Then instantiate the described named tuple with your own data, ie.When executing help(MyTuple) via the python3 command line the following is shown:Alternatively, you can also specify the parameter's type via:No, you can only add doc strings to modules, classes and function (including methods)

Suppose I have 8.8333333333333339, and I want to convert it to 8.84. How can I accomplish this in Python?round(8.8333333333333339, 2) gives 8.83 and not 8.84. I am new to Python or programming in general.I don't want to print it as a string, and the result will be further used. For more information on the problem, please check Tim Wilson's Python Programming Tips: Loan and payment calculator.8.833333333339 (or 8.833333333333334, the result of 106.00/12) properly rounded to two decimal places is 8.83. Mathematically it sounds like what you want is a ceiling function. The one in Python's math module is named ceil:Respectively, the floor and ceiling functions generally map a real number to the largest previous or smallest following integer which has zero decimal places — so to use them for 2 decimal places the number is first multiplied by 102 (or 100) to shift the decimal point and is then divided by it afterwards to compensate.If you don't want to use the math module for some reason, you can use this (minimally tested) implementation I just wrote:From the sample output it appears that they rounded up the monthly payment, which is what many call the effect of the ceiling function. This means that each month a little more than 1⁄12 of the total amount is being paid. That made the final payment a little smaller than usual — leaving a remaining unpaid balance of only 8.76.It would have been equally valid to use normal rounding producing a monthly payment of 8.83 and a slightly higher final payment of 8.87. However, in the real world people generally don't like to have their payments go up, so rounding up each payment is the common practice — it also returns the money to the lender more quickly.This is normal (and has nothing to do with Python) because 8.83 cannot be represented exactly as a binary float, just as 1/3 cannot be represented exactly in decimal (0.333333... ad infinitum).If you want to ensure absolute precision, you need the decimal module:You want to use the decimal module but you also need to specify the rounding mode. Here's an example:A much simpler way is to simply use the round() function. Here is an example.If you were to print out total_price right now you would getBut if you enclose it in a round() function like soThe output equalsThe round() function works by accepting two parameters. The first is the number you want to round. The second is the number of decimal places to round to.If you round 8.8333333333339 to 2 decimals, the correct answer is 8.83, not 8.84. The reason you got 8.83000000001 is because 8.83 is a number that cannot be correctly reprecented in binary, and it gives you the closest one. If you want to print it without all the zeros, do as VGE says:If you want to round, 8.84 is the incorrect answer. 8.833333333333 rounded is 8.83 not 8.84. If you want to always round up, then you can use math.ceil. Do both in a combination with string formatting, because rounding a float number itself doesn't make sense.The easiest way to do this is by using the below function, which is built in:For example:The output would be:Similarly:would give:Just for the record.  You could do it this way:There, no need for includes/importsHere is my solution for the round up/down problemUse the decimal module: http://docs.python.org/library/decimal.htmlََََََI have this code:and then this code:round worked for meHere is a simple function to do this for you:Here, num is the decimal number. x is the decimal up to where you want to round a floating number.The advantage over other implementation is that it can fill zeros at the right end of the decimal to make a deciaml number up to x decimal places.Example 1:will return 10.200000000 (up to 9 decimal points)Example 2:will return10.22 (up to two decimal points)

vsWhich should be preferred and why?

2009-05-24 05:11:59Z

vsWhich should be preferred and why?hasattr internally and rapidly performs the same task as the try/except block: it's a very specific, optimized, one-task tool and thus should be preferred, when applicable, to the very general-purpose alternative.Any benches that illustrate difference in performance?timeit it's your friendThere is a third, and often better, alternative:Advantages:One thing to be careful of is if you care about the case where obj.attribute is set to None, you'll need to use a different sentinel value.I almost always use hasattr: it's the correct choice for most cases.The problematic case is when a class overrides __getattr__: hasattr will catch all exceptions instead of catching just AttributeError like you expect. In other words, the code below will print b: False even though it would be more appropriate to see a ValueError exception:The important error has thus disappeared. This has been fixed in Python 3.2 (issue9666) where hasattr now only catches AttributeError.An easy workaround is to write a utility function like this:This let's getattr deal with the situation and it can then raise the appropriate exception.I would say it depends on whether your function may accept objects without the attribute by design, e.g. if you have two callers to the function, one providing an object with the attribute and the other providing an object without it. If the only case where you'll get an object without the attribute is due to some error, I would recommend using the exceptions mechanism even though it may be slower, because I believe it is a cleaner design. Bottom line: I think it's a design and readability issue rather than an efficiency issue. If it's just one attribute you're testing, I'd say use hasattr.  However, if you're doing several accesses to attributes which may or may not exist then using a try block may save you some typing.If not having the attribute is not an error condition, the exception handling variant has a problem: it would catch also AttributeErrors that might come internally when accessing obj.attribute (for instance because attribute is a property so that accessing it calls some code).I'd suggest option 2. Option 1 has a race condition if some other thread is adding or removing the attribute.Also python has an Idiom, that EAFP ('easier to ask forgiveness than permission') is better than LBYL ('look before you leap').From a practical point of view, in most languages using a conditional will always be consderably faster than handling an exception.If you're wanting to handle the case of an attribute not existing somewhere outside of the current function, the exception is the better way to go. An indicator that you may want to be using an exception instead of a conditional is that the conditional merely sets a flag and aborts the current operation, and something elsewhere checks this flag and takes action based on that.That said, as Rax Olgud points out, communication with others is one important attribute of code, and what you want to say by saying "this is an exceptional situation" rather than "this is is something I expect to happen" may be more important.This subject was covered in the EuroPython 2016 talk Writing faster Python by Sebastian Witowski. Here's a reproduction of his slide with the performance summary. He also uses the terminology look before you leap in this discussion, worth mentioning here to tag that keyword.The first.Shorter is better. Exceptions should be exceptional.At least when it is up to just what's going on in the program, leaving out the human part of readability, etc. (which is actually most of the time more imortant than performance (at least in this case - with that performance span), as Roee Adler and others pointed out).Nevertheless looking at it from that perspective,

it then becomes a matter of choosing betweenandsince hasattr just uses the first case to determine the result.

Was wondering what the best way is to match "test.this" from "blah blah blah test.this@gmail.com blah blah" is? Using Python.I've tried re.split(r"\b\w.\w@")A . in regex is a metacharacter, it is used to match any character. To match a literal dot, you need to escape it, so \.In your regex you need to escape the dot "\." or use it inside a character class "[.]", as it is a meta-character in regex, which matches any character. Also, you need \w+ instead of \w to match one or more word characters.Now, if you want the test.this content, then split is not what you need. split will split your string around the test.this. For example:You can use re.findall:So, if you want to evaluate dot literaly, I think you should put it in square brackets:In javascript you have to use \. to match a dot.ExampleandThis expression,might also work OK for those specific types of input strings.If you wish to simplify/modify/explore the expression, it's been explained on the top right panel of regex101.com.

Personally I think the second method is more elegant, but I'd like to know what the 'standard' way is.Extending bp's answer, I wanted to show you what he meant by immutable types.First, this is okay:However, this only works for immutable (unchangable) types. If the default value was mutable (meaning it can be replaced), this would happen instead:Note that both a and b have a shared attribute. This is often unwanted.This is the Pythonic way of defining default values for instance variables, when the type is mutable:The reason my first snippet of code works is because, with immutable types, Python creates a new instance of it whenever you want one. If you needed to add 1 to 1, Python makes a new 2 for you, because the old 1 cannot be changed. The reason is mostly for hashing, I believe.The two snippets do different things, so it's not a matter of taste but a matter of what's the right behaviour in your context. Python documentation explains the difference, but here are some examples:This binds num to the Foo instances. Change to this field is not propagated to other instances.Thus:This binds num to the Bar class. Changes are propagated!The code in exhibit B is plain wrong for this: why would you want to bind a class attribute (default value on instance creation) to the single instance?The code in exhibit A is okay.If you want to give defaults for instance variables in your constructor I would however do this:...or even:...or even: (preferrable, but if and only if you are dealing with immutable types!)This way you can do:Using class members to give default values works very well just so long as you are careful only to do it with immutable values. If you try to do it with a list or a dict that would be pretty deadly. It also works where the instance attribute is a reference to a class just so long as the default value is None.I've seen this technique used very successfully in repoze which is a framework that runs on top of Zope. The advantage here is not just that when your class is persisted to the database only the non-default attributes need to be saved, but also when you need to add a new field into the schema all the existing objects see the new field with its default value without any need to actually change the stored data.I find it also works well in more general coding, but it's a style thing. Use whatever you are happiest with.Using class members for default values of instance variables is not a good idea, and it's the first time I've seen this idea mentioned at all. It works in your example, but it may fail in a lot of cases. E.g., if the value is mutable, mutating it on an unmodified instance will alter the default:You can also declare class variables as None which will prevent propagation. This is useful when you need a well defined class and want to prevent AttributeErrors.

For example:Also if you need defaults:Of course still follow the info in the other answers about using mutable vs immutable types as the default in __init__.

Am I missing something?Python pseudocode of what I get:The documentation is confusing. What they mean is this:I.e. override optionxform, instead of calling it; overriding can be done in a subclass or in the instance. When overriding, set it to a function (rather than the result of calling a function).I have now reported this as a bug, and it has since been fixed.For me worked to set optionxform immediately after creating the object Add to your code:I know this question is answered, but I thought some people might find this solution useful. This is a class that can easily replace the existing ConfigParser class.Edited to incorporate @OozeMeister's suggestion:Usage is the same as normal ConfigParser.This is so you avoid having to set optionxform every time you make a new ConfigParser, which is kind of tedious.Caveat:If you use defaults with ConfigParser, i.e.:and then try to make the parser case-sensitive by using this:all your options from config file(s) will keep their case, but FOO_BAZ will be converted to lowercase.To have defaults also keep their case, use subclassing like in @icedtrees answer:Now FOO_BAZ will keep it's case and you won't have InterpolationMissingOptionError.

I've added some code to test it out on your machine and see for yourself if it makes a real difference (this is not a real performance benchmark but should give a first idea).The following graph represents the required time (in seconds) to:Configuration:I remember the performance gap being much wider when running on an older computer with older versions of the libraries (~30 seconds difference for a large scatter plot). Moreover, as mentionned in the comments, you can get equivalent quality of plots. But you will have to put more sweat into that to do it with Gnuplot.Here's the code to generate the graph if you want to give it a try on your machine:matplotlib has pretty good documentation, and seems to be quite stable. The plots it produces are beautiful - "publication quality" for sure. Due to the good documentation and the amount of example code available online, it's easy to learn and use, and I don't think you'll have much trouble translating gnuplot code to it. After all, matplotlib is being used by scientists to plot data and prepare reports - so it includes everything one needs.One marked advantage of matplotlib is that you can integrate it with Python GUIs (wxPython and PyQt, at least) and create GUI application with nice plots.After using GNUplot (with my own Python wrapper) for a long time (and really not liking the 80s-looking output), I just started having a look at matplotlib. I must say I like it very much, the output looks really nice and the docs are high quality and extensive (although that also goes for GNUplot). The one thing I spent ages looking for in the matplotlib docs is how to write to an image file rather than to the screen! Luckily this page explains it pretty well: http://www.dalkescientific.com/writings/diary/archive/2005/04/23/matplotlib_without_gui.htmlI have played with both, and I like Matplotlib much better in terms of Python integration, options, and quality of graphs/plots.About performance and plotting a great number of points: I compared this for a scatterplot of 500.000 points loaded from a text file and saved to a png, using gnuplot* and matplotlib.I ran it only once and the results don't look identical, but I think the idea is clear: gnuplot wins at performance.*I used gnuplot directly since the gnuplotpy demo doesn't work out-of-the-box for me. Matplotlib wins at Python integration.What Gnuplot can do Gnuplot-Py can do too. Because Gnuplot can be driven by pipe(pgnuplot).

Gnuplot-Py is just a thin layer for it. So you don't need worry about it.Why I prefer gnuplot maybe the many output format(PDF, PS and LaTex), which is very useful in papers, and the default output looks more scientific-style :)Some pro's of gnuplot (I still don't like matlibplot after years of usage):

If I have a list comprehension (for example) like this:Effectively making a new list that has an empty string for every element in a list, I never use the x. Is there a cleaner way of writing this so I don't have to declare the unused x variable?_ is a standard placeholder name for ignored members in a for-loop and tuple assignment, e.g.BTW your list could be written without list comprehension (assuming you want to make a list of  immutable members like strings, integers etc.).No. As the Zen puts it: Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules. The special case being loops not using the items of the thing being iterated and the rule being that there's a "target" to unpack to.You can, however, use _ as variable name, which is usually understood as "intentionally unused" (even  PyLint etc. knows and respect this).It turns out that using dummy* (starting word is dummy) as the variable name does the same trick as _. _ is a known standard and it would be better to use meaningful variable names. So you can use dummy, dummy1, dummy_anything. By using these variable names PyLint won't complain.If you need to name your arguments (in case, for example, when writing mocks that don't use certain arguments that are referenced by name), you can add this shortcut method:and then use it like thisAdd the following comment after the for loop on the same line:#pylint: disable=unused-variableThe generator objects don't actually use the variables. So something likeshould do the trick. Note that x is not defined as a variable outside of the generator comprehension.You can also prepend a variable name with _ if you prefer giving the variable a human readable name. For example you can use _foo, _foo1, _anything and PyLint won't complain. In a for loop, it would be like:edit: Add exampleComment to How can I get around declaring an unused variable in a for loop? (Ran out of comment size)Python maintains the same reference for the object created. (irrespective of mutability),for example,You, can see both i and j, refer to the same object in memory.What happens, when we change the value of one immutable variable.you can see j now starts to point a new location, (where 2 is stored), and i still points to location where 1 is stored.

While evaluating, The value is picked from 142671248, calculated(if not already cached), and put at a new location 142671236. j is made to point to

the new location. In simpler terms a new copy made everytime an immutable variable is modified.Mutable objects act little different in this regard. When the value pointed byBoth a and b point to the same memory location.Memory location pointed by a is modified.Both a and b, still point to the same memory location. In other word, mutable variables act of the same memory location pointed by the variable, instead of making a copy of the value pointed by the variable, like in immutable variable case.

I'm trying to write a program that looks at a .CSV file (input.csv) and rewrites only the rows that begin with a certain element (corrected.csv), as listed in a text file (output.txt).This is what my program looks like right now:Unfortunately, I keep getting this error, and I have no clue what it's about.Credit to all the people here to even to get me to this point.I've solved a similar problem with an easier solution:The key was using the codecs module to open the file with the UTF-16 encoding, there are a lot more of encodings, check the documentation.I'm guessing you have a NUL byte in input.csv.  You can test that withif you do,may get you around that.  Or it may indicate you have utf16 or something 'interesting' in the .csv file.You could just inline a generator to filter out the null values if you want to pretend they don't exist.  Of course this is assuming the null bytes are not really part of the encoding and really are some kind of erroneous artifact or bug.See the (line.replace('\0','') for line in f) below, also you'll want to probably open that file up using mode rb.If you want to replace the nulls with something you can do this:This will tell you what line is the problem.Perhaps this from daniweb would be helpful:...A tricky way:If you develop under Lunux, you can use all the power of sed:The most efficient solution for huge files.Checked for Python3, KubuntuI've recently fixed this issue and in my instance it was a file that was compressed that I was trying to read. Check the file format first. Then check that the contents are what the extension refers to. Turning my linux environment into a clean complete UTF-8 environment made the trick for me.

Try the following in your command line:This is long settled, but I ran across this answer because I was experiencing an unexpected error while reading a CSV to process as training data in Keras and TensorFlow.In my case, the issue was much simpler, and is worth being conscious of.  The data being produced into the CSV wasn't consistent, resulting in some columns being completely missing, which seems to end up throwing this error as well.The lesson: If you're seeing this error, verify that your data looks the way that you think it does!I've removed NULL bytes and solved this problem using a one-liner command from terminal.pandas.read_csv now handles the different UTF encoding when reading/writing and therefore can deal directly with null bytessee https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.read_csv.html

Why is this useful?Python uses a random hash seed to prevent attackers from tar-pitting your application by sending you keys designed to collide. See the original vulnerability disclosure. By offsetting the hash with a random seed (set once at startup) attackers can no longer predict what keys will collide.You can set a fixed seed or disable the feature by setting the PYTHONHASHSEED environment variable; the default is random but you can set it to a fixed positive integer value, with 0 disabling the feature altogether.Python versions 2.7 and 3.2 have the feature disabled by default (use the -R switch or set PYTHONHASHSEED=random to enable it); it is enabled by default in Python 3.3 and up.If you were relying on the order of keys in a Python dictionary or set, then don't. Python uses a hash table to implement these types and their order depends on the insertion and deletion history as well as the random hash seed.Also see the object.__hash__() special method documentation:If you need a stable hash implementation, you probably want to look at the hashlib module; this implements cryptographic hash functions. The pybloom project uses this approach.Since the offset consists of a prefix and a suffix (start value and final XORed value, respectively)  you cannot just store the offset, unfortunately. On the plus side, this does mean that attackers cannot easily determine the offset with timing attacks either.    Hash randomisation is turned on by default in Python 3. This is a security feature:In previous versions from 2.6.8, you could switch it on at the command line with -R, or the PYTHONHASHSEED environment option.You can switch it off by setting PYTHONHASHSEED to zero.hash() is a Python built-in function and use it to calculate a hash value for object, not for string or num.You can see the detail in this page: https://docs.python.org/3.3/library/functions.html#hash.and hash() values comes from the object's __hash__ method.

The doc says the followings:That's why your have diffent hash value for the same string in different console.What you implement is not a good way.When you want to calculate a string hash value, just use hashlibhash() is aim to get a object hash value, not a stirng.

Is it pythonic for a function to return multiple values?

[Is it pythonic for a function to return multiple values?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/61605/is-it-pythonic-for-a-function-to-return-multiple-values)

In python, you can have a function return multiple values.

Let's have X return that value also").When should you draw the line and define a different method?

In python, you can have a function return multiple values.  Here's a contrived example:This seems very useful, but it looks like it can also be abused ("Well..function X already computes what we need as an intermediate value.  Let's have X return that value also").When should you draw the line and define a different method?  Absolutely (for the example you provided).There is a builtin function divmod() that does exactly that.There are other examples: zip, enumerate, dict.items. BTW, parentheses are not necessary most of the time.

Citation from Python Library Reference: Therefore they should return a single object. In your case this object is a tuple. Consider tuple as an ad-hoc compound data structure. There are languages where almost every single function returns multiple values (list in Lisp).Sometimes it is sufficient to return (x, y) instead of Point(x, y).With the introduction of named tuples in Python 2.6 it is preferable in many cases to return named tuples instead of plain tuples.Firstly, note that Python allows for the following (no need for the parenthesis):Regarding your question, there's no hard and fast rule either way. For simple (and usually contrived) examples, it may seem that it's always possible for a given function to have a single purpose, resulting in a single value. However, when using Python for real-world applications, you quickly run into many cases where returning multiple values is necessary, and results in cleaner code.So, I'd say do whatever makes sense, and don't try to conform to an artificial convention. Python supports multiple return values, so use it when appropriate.The example you give is actually a python builtin function, called divmod. So someone, at some point in time, thought that it was pythonic enough to include in the core functionality.To me, if it makes the code cleaner, it is pythonic. Compare these two code blocks:Yes, returning multiple values (i.e., a tuple) is definitely pythonic.  As others have pointed out, there are plenty of examples in the Python standard library, as well as in well-respected Python projects.  Two additional comments:It's definitely pythonic. The fact that you can return multiple values from a function the boilerplate you would have in a language like C where you need to define a struct for every combination of types you return somewhere.However, if you reach the point where you are returning something crazy like 10 values from a single function, you should seriously consider bundling them in a class because at that point it gets unwieldy.Returning a tuple is cool. Also note the new namedtuple

which was added in python 2.6 which may make this more palatable for you:

http://docs.python.org/dev/library/collections.html#collections.namedtupleOT: RSRE's Algol68 has the curious "/:=" operator. eg.Giving a quotient of 3, and a remainder of 16. Note: typically the value of "(x/:=y)" is discarded as quotient "x" is assigned by reference, but in RSRE's case the returned value is the remainder.c.f. Integer Arithmetic - Algol68It's fine to return multiple values using a tuple for simple functions such as divmod. If it makes the code readable, it's Pythonic.If the return value starts to become confusing, check whether the function is doing too much and split it if it is. If a big tuple is being used like an object, make it an object. Also, consider using named tuples, which will be part of the standard library in Python 2.6.I'm fairly new to Python, but the tuple technique seems very pythonic to me.  However, I've had another idea that may enhance readability.  Using a dictionary allows access to the different values by name rather than position.  For example:
