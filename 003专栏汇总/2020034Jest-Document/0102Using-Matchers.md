# 0102. Using Matchers

Jest uses "matchers" to let you test values in different ways. This document will introduce some commonly used matchers. For the full list, see the expect API doc ([Expect · Jest](https://jestjs.io/docs/en/expect)).

## 2.1 Common Matchers

The simplest way to test a value is with exact equality.

```js
test('two plus two is four', () => {
  expect(2 + 2).toBe(4);
});
```

In this code, `expect(2 + 2)` returns an "expectation" object. You typically won't do much with these expectation objects except call matchers on them. In this code, `.toBe(4)` is the matcher. When Jest runs, it tracks all the failing matchers so that it can print out nice error messages for you.

toBe uses Object.is to test exact equality. If you want to check the value of an object, use toEqual instead:

```js
test('object assignment', () => {
  const data = {one: 1};
  data['two'] = 2;
  expect(data).toEqual({one: 1, two: 2});
});
```

这里注意啊，expect 就一个参数 data，之前自己码的时候把后面的箭头函数也当作参数传进去了。

```js
test('object assignment', () => {
  const data = { one: 1 }
  data.two = 2
  expect(data).toEqual({
    one: 1,
    two: 2
  })
})
```

』

toEqual recursively checks every field of an object or array. You can also test for the opposite of a matcher:

```js
test('adding positive numbers is not zero', () => {
  for (let a = 1; a < 10; a++) {
    for (let b = 1; b < 10; b++) {
      expect(a + b).not.toBe(0);
    }
  }
});
```

## 2.2 Truthiness

In tests, you sometimes need to distinguish between undefined, null, and false, but you sometimes do not want to treat these differently. Jest contains helpers that let you be explicit about what you want.

```
toBeNull matches only null
toBeUndefined matches only undefined
toBeDefined is the opposite of toBeUndefined
toBeTruthy matches anything that an if statement treats as true
toBeFalsy matches anything that an if statement treats as false
```

For example:

```js
test('null', () => {
  const n = null;
  expect(n).toBeNull();
  expect(n).toBeDefined();
  expect(n).not.toBeUndefined();
  expect(n).not.toBeTruthy();
  expect(n).toBeFalsy();
});

test('zero', () => {
  const z = 0;
  expect(z).not.toBeNull();
  expect(z).toBeDefined();
  expect(z).not.toBeUndefined();
  expect(z).not.toBeTruthy();
  expect(z).toBeFalsy();
});
```

You should use the matcher that most precisely corresponds to what you want your code to be doing.

## 2.3 Numbers

Most ways of comparing numbers have matcher equivalents.

```js
test('two plus two', () => {
  const value = 2 + 2;
  expect(value).toBeGreaterThan(3);
  expect(value).toBeGreaterThanOrEqual(3.5);
  expect(value).toBeLessThan(5);
  expect(value).toBeLessThanOrEqual(4.5);

  // toBe and toEqual are equivalent for numbers
  expect(value).toBe(4);
  expect(value).toEqual(4);
});
```

For floating point equality, use toBeCloseTo instead of toEqual, because you don't want a test to depend on a tiny rounding error.

```js
test('adding floating point numbers', () => {
  const value = 0.1 + 0.2;
  //expect(value).toBe(0.3);           This won't work because of rounding error
  expect(value).toBeCloseTo(0.3); // This works.
});
```

## 2.4 Strings

You can check strings against regular expressions with toMatch:

```js
test('there is no I in team', () => {
  expect('team').not.toMatch(/I/);
});

test('but there is a "stop" in Christoph', () => {
  expect('Christoph').toMatch(/stop/);
});
```

## 2.5 Arrays and iterables

You can check if an array or iterable contains a particular item using toContain:

```js
const shoppingList = [
  'diapers',
  'kleenex',
  'trash bags',
  'paper towels',
  'beer',
];

test('the shopping list has beer on it', () => {
  expect(shoppingList).toContain('beer');
  expect(new Set(shoppingList)).toContain('beer');
});
```

## 2.6 Exceptions

If you want to test whether a particular function throws an error when it's called, use toThrow.

```js
function compileAndroidCode() {
  throw new Error('you are using the wrong JDK');
}

test('compiling android goes as expected', () => {
  expect(compileAndroidCode).toThrow();
  expect(compileAndroidCode).toThrow(Error);

  // You can also use the exact error message or a regexp
  expect(compileAndroidCode).toThrow('you are using the wrong JDK');
  expect(compileAndroidCode).toThrow(/JDK/);
});
```
