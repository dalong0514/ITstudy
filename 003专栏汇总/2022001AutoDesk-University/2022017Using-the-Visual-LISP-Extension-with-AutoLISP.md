[Using the Visual LISP Extension with AutoLISP | Autodesk University](https://www.autodesk.com/autodesk-university/class/Using-Visual-LISP-Extension-AutoLISP-2018)

Description
The AutoLISP programming language is very powerful by itself, but so much more can be done with AutoLISP by using the Visual LISP extension. The Visual LISP extension lets you access parts of the Windows operating system and the AutoCAD application that AutoLISP can't normally access. In this session, you will learn how to work with events and reactors, access the Windows registry, utilize AutoCAD and Windows ActiveX libraries, and connect to other Windows applications like Microsoft Word or Microsoft Excel. This session is not recommended for those new to AutoLISP.
Key Learnings
Learn how to access and store values in the Windows registry
Learn how to register application, document, and other types of reactors
Learn how to open drawing files outside of the AutoCAD application
Learn how to manipulate the Windows environment and MS Office applications with AutoLISP
