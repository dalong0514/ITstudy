Jerry Winters

Jerry Winters has taught at nearly every U.S.-based Autodesk University over the past 17 years primarily on topics of AutoCAD software customization using Microsoft Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) and VB.NET. He brings a unique blend of education and entertainment as he tackles what would otherwise be a dry topic. And while he reserves the week before Thanksgiving for meeting with and enjoying the company of his Autodesk friends, the rest of the year is spent with his beautiful wife of 26 years and his 9 (yes, that's 9) children in rural Lake Point, Utah, where they are occasionally found singing at community events and senior centers.
