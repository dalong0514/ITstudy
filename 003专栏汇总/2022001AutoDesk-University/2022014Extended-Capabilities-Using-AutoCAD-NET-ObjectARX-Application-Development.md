Description
This instructional demonstration will teach AutoCAD.NET API software developers how to extend the managed ObjectARX libraries to use hidden functionality. The standard AutoCAD .NET managed libraries provide extensive support, but there are some capabilities that aren't wrapped into the managed libraries. In this instructional demonstration, we'll discuss ways to work with AutoCAD software files and ObjectARX libraries. The demonstration will show how to use available managed .NET applications. We will also provide sample code that you can modify and use in your applications.
Key Learnings
Learn how to extend the AutoCAD .NET managed capability
Discover exported functions in AutoCAD files that can be imported to managed code
Learn how to get the structure of the exported functions and import them into managed code
Discover Platform Invoke (P/Invoke)
