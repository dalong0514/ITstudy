[A Practical Sample of Building a Custom User Interactive AutoCAD Command | Autodesk University](https://www.autodesk.com/autodesk-university/class/Practical-Sample-Building-Custom-User-Interactive-AutoCAD-Command-2020)

Description
Writing code to define a custom command is as easy as decorating class/method with [CommandClass]/[CommandMethod] attributes. But making the command user friendly and error-proof involves taking many factors into account while actually implementing the process of the command execution, which may warrant far more code than originally expected. This instruction demo will show the development of a custom “FILLET” command in detail with AutoCAD .NET API code.
Key Learnings
Learn how to create a custom command.
Learn how to analyze information/data needed for the command execution and possible user interaction.
Learn how to design the code structure.
